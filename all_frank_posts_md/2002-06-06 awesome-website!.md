OK y'all, I hope you're ready for this. Before my discovery of this site a few days ago, I never really bothered to investigate Edgar Cayce too much. I really didn't know very much about him, to be honest. Now, I've been researching this whole Ascension/Dimensional Shift thing for about a month now, and I'm pretty much adjusted to the main ideas now. However, this site is VERY convincing, and holds a few surprises too. Check out this link and tell me what you think, and even if you can't believe everything there, the site is still a great resource for info about a lot of subjects.

<br>
More importantly, the webmaster states that he has learned that all of life can be broken down to one simple choice: the choice to serve others, or to serve self. To serve others is to strive to become one with the creator, whereas service to self creates disharmony and seperatedness. This idea is nothing new to me, and I really like it, but after reading the website this principle took on new, profound meaning to me.
<br>
<br>
Besides that, get ready, because it's a very exciting time to be alive. No matter what happens, what 'disasters' come to pass, everything will work itself out in the end.
<br>
<br>
Love and light be with you,
<br>

life can be broken down into many such choices: to live to do good or to do evil (not selfish vs non-selfish), or to follow others or to lead others, to think about life and try to know everything or to act within life and do what needs to be done, etc.
<br>
<br>
actually, life can't be broken down so easily; life is a complex intermixing of events, ideas, knowledge, experiences, others, self, discovery, action, reflection, helping, hurting, and many more things. true, you could say that a person's life is based in either one route or another, but to do so seperates life from itself and changes it into a mere road to follow. there are literally thousands of different possible paths that a person could choose, or none at all. who you decide to be is up to you.
<br>
<br>
no, to serve others isn't to strive to become one with our creator (why does everyone assume that we become ONE with God anyway? that sounds really silly to me), it is just serving others. God, in many religions, advocates that people help/serve one another, but this is just a side-note of finding God; because without it you cannot find him, but just doing it doesn't mean you find him. and disharmony and seperatedness come from more than just being selfish; i have tried most of my life to serve others, but they are still rude and uncaring towards me and my kindness.
<br>
<br>
but i guess this should be done in the philosophy board instead of here. sorry.

I was reading the intro on the site and I came to the part about his dream with the moon and the rings. I found this weird because the other night I had a dream, it became rather lucid which is odd for me. Everything was black except the moon which was full, there was nothing else. Then this blue/white neon glowing ring broke from the moon and the moon went away leaving just this ring. Then the ring split into another ring and these two rings kind of danced/moved around. Then this face appeared behind the rings, a female face in full color. The rings faded and the face became more vivid. I then woke up but the dream let an impression on me, like I should remember it. Not saying they are connected but it is odd that it was similar.

kakkarot: Basically, I believe several things pertaining to this matter that were not included in my original post. The purpose of the post was really to alert others to the website and briefly note my feelings about it. One, I believe that we (humans) are all here by choice, and for certain reasons. Two, I believe that we are all distortions (not in a negative sense, more like refractions) of God, The One, whatever, and that we intentionally fragmented ourselves down through the dimensional levels. Three, I believe that on the physical plane, to realize that we are all connected and all refractions of this energy that is God, is difficult, especially in our culture. Four, I believe that all entities in the Universe, deep down inside, yearn and strive to grow and commune with that Oneness again. Five, I believe that this subconscious desire and the difficulty of fullfilling it, especially on this plane, is what creates conflict, suffering, and a self-serving attitude. Six (why am I numbering these?), I believe that everything is a vibration of energy, and that a self-serving orientation lowers the vibration of you and those around you, meaning you move further from the One, the Source. Conversely, serving others and loving others in the realization that we are all refractions of the One raises your vibrations and those around you, as love is the most powerful force in this cosmos. Finally, I believe that everything happens for a reason, and that every event and everyone you meet holds a lesson pertinent to your spiritual growth and healing.
<br>
<br>
I rarely get specific about my beliefs on this board, because I feel that they're not as relevant here as in my own life, and I don't want to offend anyone or start an argument. I hope we're all here for the same purpose, to learn, discuss, civily debate, etc. My beliefs are constantly changing and include viewpoints and interpretations from many different sources. Most of all, I listen to my heart and my guidance from above, and do what it tells me is right.
<br>
<br>
That you have served others in your life with less-than-desirable results is unfortunate. There are many who seek only to take advantage of others kindness and generosity, and this may be a karmic lesson from a past incarnation. This ties into my belief that everything that happens in your life holds a lesson pertaining to your spiritual growth and healing.
<br>
<br>
I think that's enough for now. Peace - bitsmart

j/k
<br>
<br>
ok, i get where you are coming from with your definition of loving. my definition is just in the act of loving itself, not a whole ideal. so that is where we differ and that is where i read into your post wrong. sorry.

No need to apologize, I simply felt compelled to clarify myself.

Bitsmart: No need to apologize. I find my beliefs to be pretty much the same as yours save for some terminological tweaks.
<br>
I think we are here of our own will to learn some lesson.
<br>
I believe that we are all the same and of the same. I call it being facets of the All/God/It/Them/Whatever.
<br>
I believe that the first few times over we are apart from the AGITW we tend
<br>
to the selfish side, relishing the newfound freedom.
<br>
I believe energy is what We(sp!) are (event eaving out Albert&amp;Qmech&amp;all).
<br>
<br>
Beliefs can be surprisingly relevant provided some common ground or understandable translation can be found. I for one apppreciate your posting your views/beliefs on matters.
<br>
<br>
As an aside, the thelemic mottos "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." and  "Love is the law, love under will." pretty much sum these beliefs.
<br>
We are here to execute the Will (advancement as individual spiritual beings) and we need to go through certain experiences and steps respecting the will and path of others while executing the will.

Well the webmaster apparently thinks that he is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, so I'd take whatever he says with a grain of salt. It's easy to form a conclusion and then pick and choose various "sacred" numbers to fit it, but I guess we'll see in the near future what's really going on.
