<br>
....but still theres more...
<br>
1) i think i have finnally acheived a light trance, but i need some clarification..... i DID have the heavy body feeling, but sometimes my mind would wonder and id think "oooops, better get back to the trance", but i thought robert said if you break concentration the trance will be over, im thinking weather i was just lucky, or weather i  havent actually acheived a trance.Ii also sometimes felt like i was floating slightly- how do i maintain this floating sensation???
<br>
<br>
2)  arent i meant to hear a buzzing when in trance, i heard no buzzing?
<br>
<br>
3) when i  was in the trance, i would sometimes think, "ill do some energy raising for a bit, then come back to the tracne",  should i not mix them like this???  as in should i wait until im done with the trance, THEN do the NEW work.
<br>
<br>
i thought id be killing 2 birds with one stone by doing the NEW as i was getting into a trance.
<br>

It sounds like you did accomplish a good level of trance. You can go out of body from a light trance. It says so in "Astral Dynamics." You can have all of the symptoms of trance or most of them or just a few. Having none of them would be another matter. It is not necessary to worry about any one specific sensation, like hearing a buzzing noise. If you want to raise some energy while in trance or let your mind drift some, that is fine. It is better to do most of your energy raising in a normal state of consciousness because it allows the channels and energy centers to adapt, but raising energy in trance some of the time is okay. If you want to let your mind drift, the thing to watch out for is falling asleep. As long as you are still aware and watching your mind's activities then your concentration is still present and solid. It is possible to go into a trance state while you still have physical tension. Continuing to deepen your state of relaxation while in trance would be a good thing to do, too.

hi,
<br>
<br>
Trance is a good time to do energy work, as long as that's your intent.  Also, you might hear and see all kinds of things while in a trance state and they're really fun sometimes, if you just accept them.
<br>
<br>
Then again, have fun with your bodily states only if you wish to remain there. As long as you dwell on your body that's where you will stay.  If you want to OBE, the trick is to forget you even have a body . . .

<section>
thanks for the advice,
<br>
Tisha,  i know what you mean about forgeting you have a body, but how can you do energy raising if you forget your body?
<br>
How do i deepen my level of trance, do i just have to  wait,concentrate,wait,concentrate,wait,concentrate?

I'm not all that knowledgeable on mystical terminology and I don't know what is meant by "energy raising". I hear this term all the time. If there is someone who could describe for me please what energy-raising means, in simple terms, I'd be grateful.
<br>
<br>
If "energy raising" involves something to do with the Physical body then I cannot see how it could aid Astral Projection. But, as I say, I'm floundering in the dark a bit here.
<br>
<br>
The times when I have activated bodily "chakras" I did it by developing a focal point of awareness about the region of the chakra and, after a short while, it would activate.
<br>
<br>
For Astral Projection, you basically do the the same thing but go upwards, into your head. So it feels like you are looking down, onto your nose. At this point, you have absolutely no feeling of a physical body whatsoever.
<br>
<br>
Then, if you shift upwards a little further, your your sense of conscious awareness will "plug into" the section of your brain that connects to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Frank, there is a theory that states that you can fill up your body with power, like a gas tank.  It is also theorized that psychic work uses up a lot of this "gas."  "Raising energy" is just another term for filling up the "tank" so that you can "drive."  Many magickal practitioners believe they can take the energy in their bodies and intensify it . . . multiply it.
<br>
<br>
I don't know about that . . . power kind of is what it is.  In my opinion, you can become more aware of it, you can "bring it out," and you can use it up.  But I can only increase it when I am drawing upon something (like the power in the dirt beneath my feet . . . or a tree who doesn't mind sharing).
<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.  Another way to look at it is:  "Raising Energy" exercises might simply draw your awareness to the energy (power) in your body that is already there no matter what.  In other words, nevermind the gas tank analogy if you don't feel it applies to you.
<br>
<br>
The gas tank analogy DEFINITELY applies to me.  Not that it matters so much for OBE . . . I've projected on an empty "tank" many times. But it was an UNPLEASANT experience, I couldn't control it, and I couldn't remember anything beyond the vibrations and the panic.  In other words, NO FUN!  I have a much better time of it when I'm on a "full" tank.  Full of power, full of peace.
<br>
<br>
Just like how it's so much easier to get through the day with enough sleep, food and drink . . . you can function while sleep deprived and on an empty stomach, but you won't perform at your peak and you won't have much fun. As above, so below.
<br>
<br>
I agree with you Frank . . . raising energy during trance is unlikely to bring on an OBE because it is focused on the body.  You don't want to hit the speedway while you are busy filling up the tank . . . it's too hard.  Inflight refueling can be done . . . but why bother when some energy raising on the ground will do the trick.
<br>

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
I think people use words "energy", "awareness", "vibration",  "dimension", "level" and so on interchangeably and without much of scientific reasoning. The choice of words depends on personal experience and school of thinking. All this makes it more confusing...but everyone gets some idea what one is talking about.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
<br>
DG.
