Hello, I'm new to these forums and new to OBE's I've never had one but I've been trying for over a year. Recently when I've entered into a trance on the verge of a dream when I'm trying to purposely OBE i often hear this WHOOSH this sound keeps waking me fully conscious. I've read from some other threads its an indication of your conscious changing state and your physical senses been turned off. How do i prevent it from waking myself up do I simply have to learn to ignore it?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
You are not always going to be locked in this. If you would simply let events flow and be happy with the progress you are making rather than keep purposely keep trying anything.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

These sounds have a pulsating nature. First they come and go in every 10-30 seconds. At this stage your task is simply to relax more and find a way how to decrease the silence in-between. After some practice the pulses will follow each other more frequently. At one point they merge into a single, harsh, loud noise, an equivalent of the famous vibrational stage followed by various degree of silence with some mild buzz in the background. At this point you can separate from your sleeping body if you're not pushed already out.

<br>
These noises mark that your awareness has infiltrated the second stage of sleep. It's a very good sign actually, I advice you to say with it. It's a very direct method for mastering OBE-induction abilities. To get this stage more easily I advice you to experiment with sleep interruption. Also, watch for noises every time when you naturally wake up from a dream. Just be open and relaxed for the very first moment, watch for and try to modulate the pulsation you may feel in the middle of your head or pressures in your ears. Using earplugs will certainly help.

About the noises. According to my research these impulses are the auditory manifestations of thalmic impulses that sleep biologists observe as sleep spindles on the EEG. Being originated from the reticular thalamus they will close the sensory gate and push you into a deeper stage of sleep. After the sensory gate of the thalamus is closed you couldn't feel your body anymore, unable to hear or move. This is actually the very first stage in which you can separate in a second body.

Very interesting. I get these Whooooosh sounds frequently when meditating. Usually at that instant I stop feeling my body completely (it is not a gradual process, but sudden) and start separating. Im still experimenting with these first stages of OBE.

What kind of meditation do you practice?

Was that a question for me?
<br>
<br>
Well, I just relax as much as possible, then work with my chakras for some time charging them and then sometimes I just immagine that I am flying. I actually see myself as an eagle, see my feathers shining in the bright sunlight and beautiful view under me--see or mountains. It is very liberating. Or sometimes after achieving proper relaxation I keep drifting in and out of the hypnagogic state and trying to remember what I see.
<br>
<br>
Usually pretty soon I get that "transparent eyelids" feeling and the whoosh sound.

It's clear now, thanks. At first I thought you sit for your meditation, this is why I was curious. But your "meditation" is more like a stand-alone induction method. Sounds cool though.
