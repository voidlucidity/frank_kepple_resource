Tonight has been a pretty exciting night for me, as it was the first controlled experience I have had with a close-to OBE.
<br>
<br>
I started out meditating from the awake state and after about an hour I could feel myself getting deeper and deeper into trance. Gradually, I began to actually hear energy flowing through me in what sounded like a resonating circular spinning motion. I concentrated my awareness on this energy source and just continued to allow myself to relax and my mind cleared. At this point, I thought it might be neat to try a projection technique and all of the sudden as I was trying the rope technique, the vibrations started to increase. They felt completely different than I ever expected, as the first thing I noticed was that my heart started racing, yet it felt as if it was pounding out of my stomach. My whole body felt like it was shaking as the vibrations got more and more intense. I started to see flashes of light and I paced my breathing as the flashes and the vibrations began to accelerate. I started to feel an incredible separation of consciousness as if I could feel my expanded etheric body inside my body just screaming with power. But then I started having breathing problems and I have to break my concentration to take some heavy breaths because I got scared that I wasn't breathing. Slowly, my breathing returned to normal and my heartbeat as well. I waited for about 5 minutes in the meditative state and tried again. My energy body felt very weak at this point and I awoke from trance in a very weak state, just crawling on the floor feeling like I had used up my etheric energy.
<br>
<br>
I think I just got scared, but it might have been that my energy body is not fully developed. Anyone have any suggestions what I should have done differently?
<br>
<br>
I think if I were able to maybe ignoring my breathing and just have kept focusing on the projection technique, that might have worked.

In a way you have answered your own question. It's obvious you got scared and your protective sense of awareness pulled you out of it. Fear of not breathing is a common one together with other fears such as thinking you have died, and that kind of thing. It's all very common at first.
<br>
<br>
All you need to do is simply let the experience run its course. Perhaps it may take a number of attempts before you can do this. But that would be very normal as well. Fortunately, when you get used to these sensations the impact of them lessens considerably.
<br>
<br>
With me now, for example, I hardly ever feel any kind of vibrations at all. To the extent where I can't remember the last time I felt actual vibrations. Yet in the beginning the vibrations felt so bad it was as if I were sitting on a very unbalanced spin-dryer rotating at top speed. Then I'd shoot forwards at an incredible rate like I had been shot from a cannon or something.
<br>
<br>
At every level there are challenges to be faced. Which, in the early stages, almost always means overcoming fears of one description or another.
<br>

Sometimes I feel the same thing. I think its becasue its around the time your body is seperating, and its not that your not breathing, but that you can still hear your breathing, but cant feel it anymore from your physical bodies point of view.
