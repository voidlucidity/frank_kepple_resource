<section>
Hello to you all and thanks for having this wonderful board!
<br>
<br>
My name is Ana-Maria and I have joined your forum a couple of weeks ago and already enjoyed some discussions, but I still haven't introduced myself.
<br>
<br>
I've been practicing Sahaja Yoga meditation for a few years, which is focused of self realization through Kundalini awakening and I had some nice experiences. And, according to these experiences, indeed, Kundalini energy can be raised nowadays much more easily that in any other period in the history. I haven't read entirely what has been posted here on this topic, but the Kundalini discussions are some of my favorites...
<br>
<br>
I discovered the Astral Pulse Forum looking information about the crystal children, which lead me to a Lightworker forum, then here

. I hope that I will succeed in tuning myself to the expectations you have here.

<br>
<br>
I haven't been dreaming so much lately

, generally when I get a message it happens during the awakened state, in meditation. So I suppose that's one thing I have to get more used to... I was asking myself if this would not be the reason I have found you.
<br>
<br>
I have some questions, but I'll try to look around a bit more, read more about other experiences and Robert Bruce and other people, and then ask.
<br>
<br>
So, trying to see deeper what's going on with my dreams and which is the connection between my experiences and the astral projections,

Hello Ana-Maria
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the lovely introduction.
<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy the Astral Pulse Forums. Â There is a search facility, and if you enter "kundalini", you will find a lot of information about it.
<br>
<br>
We look forward to your participation and questions!
