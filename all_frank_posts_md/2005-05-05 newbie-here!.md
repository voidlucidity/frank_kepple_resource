My name is Kim and I'm 33 years old.  I have been searching for many years for answers to experiences I've been having since I was 13, and never thought to check for a message board until yesterday.  I'm so excited to meet other people who have similar experiences , who I can share my experiences with, and who hopefully can answer some questions.  It's not like I could just ask my friends, you know?  When I was younger I would be awakened in my bed by a weird sensation creeping over my whole body.  (I might describe it now as vibrations).  The covers would feel like they were creeping over me.  I was convinced there was something evil trying to get me and I was terrified.  After some years  I decided to call out to what was there and face it.  As the familiar sensation occur ed I called out and hands grabbed my feet and yanked me to the end of the bed.  I was terrified even more!  I snapped out of that sensation sure I was at the bottom of the bed, but I was at the top.  Even more confused.  Next time I was on a train when this happened.  I called out again and two hands grabbed my hands.  This time I saw a boy with a cap and a cut on his head.  He didn't speak, but all this information came to me about how he fell off a boat and hit his head.  I knew he had drowned but he didn't know he was dead.  Every time I tried to snap out of it I felt the creeping sensation and the boy was back.  This freaked me enough that I contacted Sylvia Brown, who I was just starting to learn about .  I never expected what she told me was happening.  She said I was astrally projecting and catching myself either leaving or entering my body.  So, I have been researching ever since.  I have many inter sting experiences but none under my control.  I guess I should decibel them in another section.  Anyway,I can't wait to get to know all of you.
