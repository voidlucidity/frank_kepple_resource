I opened a fortune cookie to find out what it was saying was not only correct but maybe even paranormal.
<br>
<br>
"Watch how you interact with people, be reserved."
<br>
<br>
It's very true in my personal life because sometimes people can't understand me, what i'm all about etc.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible, that answers to our life's questions and mysteries manifest themselves physically?
<br>
<br>
Is their some kind of synchronicity involved, being at the right place at the right time?

Never underestimate the power of a fortune cookie...

I'm being deadly serious.  For a change.

But I did have to move it to Astral Chat because it really has got nothing to do with OBEs.

I had a good business idea the other day about fortune cookies.
<br>
<br>
usually they are only good fortunes, but what if there was an equal number of dubious fortunes shuffled in.  The patrons would be in for a surprise and the restaurant would become a novelty.  for instance some fortunes could be something along the lines of:
<br>
<br>
You may experience a series of unfortunate events in the near future.
<br>
<br>
The wise man makes sure his dog is securely fastened to the leash, or does not escape from the home.  IF not, danger will ensue.
<br>
<br>
Danger may ensue while driving on wet pavement. Lucky number: 13
