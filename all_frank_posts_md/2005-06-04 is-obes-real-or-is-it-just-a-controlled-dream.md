<section>
hello.
<br>
<br>
throughout my life I used to fall asleep on my back with both arms sticking up in the air (almost like a holdup, but I am inflexible so the arms dont exactly touch the bed, too much lifting weights) ... regardless, I would wake up and be paralized for several minutes.  At a later point in my life, I came across a sleep specialist and they said that I was overtired and I was waking up out of the REM Sleep Cycle.    I increased the amount of sleep per night, and my "problem went away"....
<br>
<br>
(ANY COMMENTS ON THIS?)
<br>
<br>
several years passed...
<br>
<br>
I stumbled on a Coast to Coast show with William Buhlman ... the show was on OBEs and how sleep paralysis was considered a possible precursor for some people.  Needless to say that night I started to clear my mind and visualize a rotating object.  I then got something I never had before, the vibrations and a VERY loud BAND (sounded like a gunshot).  Needless to say I started to look into it more and found that this was related to OBEs as well.  I got VERY EXCITED.
<br>
The next day I purchased the book from Buhlman : Adventures Beyond the Body and when received, I read it in one night.
<br>
While I was waiting for the book to arrive, I had several more dreams of falling and then a really loud BANG...but when I awoke I was in sleep paralysis...
<br>
<br>
I used to get scared of the sleep paralysis, now I look towards it...but now that I am looking for it I havent been able to have a lot of repeatability.  I am currently at the stage where I can now get myself to have vibrations in hands/feet/neck/ forehead (within a few minutes) however that is as far as I get.  I am laying there trying to visualize myself floating or pulling myself up a rope, but I get nothing.  I understand that I am a "newbie" and that I need more practice with alternative techniques to see what works best for me.
<br>
<br>
My background is in engineering and I need to be able to perform experiments and have objective evidence....
<br>
<br>
1) How can you be assured that you are acutally separated from your body in real time and that it just isnt an active imagination or lucid dream?
<br>
For example has anyone ever performed an experiment where you call someone you know ( on the phone ) and tell them to draw something and place it on their kitchen table.... then perform an OBE and go over to their house and SEE what is on the table, and call them back with the answer?
<br>
<br>
<br>
2)  I dont know if I am crazy or not but after trying to perform OBEs I have a constant tingling sensation in the base of my skull (during normal waking hrs) ... is this abnormal?
<br>
<br>
3) Is there any supplementation that may assist in the process? for example 5-HTP (enhances positive mood)?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time,
<br>

Thank you for the reply.
<br>
Seems to be a very controversial topic. I didnt get to read through all of them YET.... ( so far spent about 3 hrs just reading the first 4 hyperlinks)
<br>
Thanks for the time spent hyperlinking.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In all honesty I am trying to investigate for myself.
<br>
<br>
"Only though experience will one gain knowledge"
<br>
<br>
I was just wondering as a poll ...
<br>
how many have sucessfully tried to perform some kind of experiments...what they were ...and the results.
<br>
<br>
As far as my progress...
<br>
I popped out again, but only for an instant.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time
