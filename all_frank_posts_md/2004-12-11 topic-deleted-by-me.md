I wrote a reply to someone to the message "AN ATTACK OR A MESSAGE??" in the Psychic Self-Defense forum.  It was written in February 17, 2002 at around 1:40 + or - under my old username LadyLea.  I had forgotten I was a member when I rejoined  a week or so ago.  I was sending a reply to one of the posters.  I did a spell check and submitted it.  Then it got squirrelly.  It took three-four minutes to get it on and when it was on, it was a double post.  I didn't want to have two posts on there so I pressed the "x" to the right and tried to delete one of them.  Somehow I managed to delete my entire post from 2002?  I was finally receiving some helpful information when that happened.  Is there anyway it can be retrieved or is it completely gone?
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the inconvenience.  This has never happened to me before on this sight or any other.  I thought in order for the post to be deleted I'd have to be signed in as LadyLea and that account is inactive I believe because I checked after I found the post several days ago.
<br>
<br>
Thanks!

Hi
<br>
<br>
I just had EXACTLY the same experience as Juliet
<br>
<br>
There was a very recent thread about "the use of flying as a reality check" in the Dreams forum.
<br>
<br>
Well I posted a reply to it, and now the entire thread has completely disappeared!
<br>
<br>
I posted twice, both times apparently unsuccessfuly (my browser just hung).  The I went back into the forum and found that both identical posts had actually succeeeded.  So then I attempted to delete the more recent post.  At this point everything hung again, and now the whole thread has disappeared!
<br>
<br>
This is a little worrying because we could easily accidentally lose some very long and valuable threads by this method!
<br>
<br>
FYI, just prior to this happening, I was receiving error messages saying "too many connections open" to the "SQL database server" (or something like that.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure this is related to the error.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but there is nothing we can do to reclaim the post. Unfortunately, technology is not perfect. Now and again posts get lost in the works for various reasons. Either something locks up, or hangs just at the wrong moment (I guess there is never a "right" moment for this to happen) the system might need to be rebooted, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
I learnt this lesson the hard way, unfortunately, and lost a large post not long after I joined. Since then I do all my composing in MS Word and cut&amp;paste to the forum. Except, of course, for very short replies.
<br>
<br>
HTH
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for the quick reply.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes computers can really bite but overall they connect us to the world so it's worth it for the inconvenience.  I should have listened to my hunch yesterday.  For some reason, I felt like I should copy each of the posts into wordpad.  I wish I had.  I feel foolish for not listening to that "voice" in my head. LOL
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>

Hi all
<br>
<br>
Yup I (nearly) always save my post as I go along, using wordpad.
<br>
<br>
I thought this morning, it would be REALLY useful if the authors of this website could provide a little program which we could run separately.  The little program would have all of the formatting options available on the web site, together with a "preview" option.  But most importantly, it would have a "save" button to save your half-finished post to a text file on your hard drive.  In this way every time you clicked "save" you knew your post was safe from glitches and crashes.  When ready, just cut and paste back into the web site.
<br>
<br>
This would also benefit the web site - I'm sure a lot of the traffic on your web server is people hitting the "preview" button.  I was getting "database connection" error messages whilst clicking "preview", so the "preview" function is obviously costly.

Sounds like a winner of an idea to me.  Hot it does sound like it would be costly and operating this website is expensive.  Maybe if more donations were made??  It's a good idea.  Maybe it will come to fruition.  One can hope ...
<br>
<br>
Until there is always wordpad! :lol:

Actually, a few months earlier there was a poll as to whether members would be willing to pay a small fee to maintain the site.  At the time, I wasn't so sure, but when the site went down I missed it quite a lot and now I'm a lot more sympathetic to this notion....  It's a huge task maintaining this site and does cost money....!
