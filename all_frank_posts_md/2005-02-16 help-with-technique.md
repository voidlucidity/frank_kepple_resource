Hello All,
<br>
<br>
I have been meditating and working with my chakra's for a little more than three months. I do this almost on a daily basis. It's hard for me to just meditate without my energy centers going crazy.  One thing that I have noticed is that most times when I sit or lie down to meditate I quickly feel a floating feeling. When I first started it took me quite awhile to get this feeling. I have also noticed that I can hold this much longer than before. At first it was maybe a couple of minutes..now it's about twenty. This feeling then turns to heavy vibrations but I still haven't been successful with having an obe. I have been taking an approach of practicing and looking within myself for all of the answers to be able to obe. I am using the rope technique and sometimes feel that its working but still nothing.  I am definitely not loosing my patience at all. I want to know if that even though I haven't had an obe should I keep continuing what I am doing even though it hasn't worked yet?

Hi Time Traveler
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like you`re heading in the right direction and are getting closer to an OBE.The sensations of active energy, floating and even the elusive vibrations are all indications that you`re getting yourself in the right state to project. I`m glad you`re not losing patience. It took me 4 months of daily practice so hang in there.
<br>
<br>
Here`s a few things to try. Do your practice at different times of the day: I discovered it`s much easier for me in the afternoon. Try a few different exit techs. I`ve never had any luck with rope-I think it makes me focus too much on the physical.Finally, the thing that got me out the first time was to stop trying. One day I lay down to take a nap and the whole thing happened all by itself. Sometimes you need to get out of your own way!
<br>
<br>
Cheers

How about trying a non-method?  By this I mean stop trying for a week.  Forget all thoughts about it.
<br>
<br>
It'll probably happen.  I'm serious.
<br>
<br>
Try it!

I'm sorry, I don't want to put a spoke in your works, but now and again I send my energy centres
<i>
 crazy
</i>
and I get a darned sight more than a "floating feeling".
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Corall, Selski and Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks....I think I will take a week off. Once, I thought if I didn't practice that someday I might loose my abilities. But now I really don't think this is true. I will keep you up to date on any new developments.
