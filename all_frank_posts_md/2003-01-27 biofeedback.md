<section>
I'm interested in finding out if anyone in this forum has used biofeedback training to achieve altered states. I know that TMI's hemisync tapes/CD's are reproductions of EEG results from people who were in altered states, but listening to them has very rarely resulted in anything but C1 for me. I think I would have better results if I had feedback that would allow me to realize the instants when I do achieve the desired state, before I fall back out of it again. I have used TMI tapes for 20 years now, so it is not a lack of practice or persistence.
<br>
Anybody have any input?
<br>
Thanks!

I explored this avenue and would dearly love to do some experiments but a proper EEG machine is a tad out of my financial reach. I posted a while ago about a gadget I came across that measured skin resistance which I found effective.

There is no doubt that the Monroe Institute did and still does exceptional work regarding altered states and Astral projection, and accordingly, their hemi-sync products and training work for many people.
<br>
<br>
It seems unfortunate however that most people see these products as "Astral projection in a box". At birth, we are all tuned in to the higher spheres, and can travel there and back at will. As people get older, life experiences gradually submerge these abilities (which were never intended to be submerged)util the do not exist at all on the surface.  Everyone has the latent ability to recall these inherent abilities, but the ease at which it can be accomplished depends upon how deeply they are submerged due to life experiences (and indeed past life experiences),and what is subsequently done to bring them to the surface again. That is why some people seemto be gifted with these abilities, and some have to try very hard.
<br>
<br>
"Listening" to the hemi-sync is not the emphasis. The emphasis is rather on focussing on accessing inner states by means of imagery and other methods to distance from the mundane physical senses, while the hemi-sync does its work in the background.  The emphasis therefore must be on the end objective rather then the current "now".
<br>
<br>
With best regard,

Adrian.

yes, Adrian, all you said. Like I said....I have spent 20 years working on this stuff. Two TMI programs, Bruce Moen's workshop, a couple of shamanic dream workshops, much practice. I won't say "nothing" has happened; I've had a few OBE's, many pre-cognitive and interesting dreams, several visions, but I think that I am too left-brained to make permanent inroads through intent and practice, or it would have happened already. Since the left brain is dominant, it seems the wiser course is to utilize it against itself, so to speak, and find different methods than what I have already spent much time on. I am in a position to afford biofeedback equipment if I knew what to get, and would consider doing that. I was hoping someone would have a little experience and could provide some information.
