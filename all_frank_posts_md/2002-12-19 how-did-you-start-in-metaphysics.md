I'm just curious as to how different people got started in metaphysical...things (for lack of a better word).  AP, OOBE, Magicks, Psychic Abilities, anything.  How did you get started?  What happened to make you interested?  And, if anyone is willing, what age were you when you started studying?
<br>
<br>
I suppose I'll start it off.  It started this summer when I had a particular dream.  I wanted to know, if at all possible, if I could manipulate dreams.  The urge to dream dreams like that again drove me to research it.  I then found out about Lucid Dreaming.  After researching more about Lucid Dreaming, I came upon Astral Projection.  One thing led to another, and before I knew it I was here, on

.  So, that's it for me.  I just stumbled upon it.

The first time I learned about out of body experiences was when I saw a scientific show about the subject.  I think it was on the Discovery Channel.  The show got me interested, so I looked up out of body experiences on the internet and learned a lot about them and other metaphysical things.

Good question.

I think shows and movies got me interested in parapsychology when I was a kid. I became curious about theories, psychic phenomenon, etc. So, at the age of sixteen, I discovered that my grandfather was a very spiritual person. That was the year that I spent at least a month visiting my grandparents in MN. We also went to our home country, Denmark, for a month. All that time I had plenty of books to read. They were all old books, but they started my long windy road. My beleifs have changed many times since then, but that's life!

It started for me with just basic meditation.  Then went to focused meditation to inhance certain talents.  From there I just started to have wierder things happen and begain looking for answers as to why.
<br>
<br>
And now I am here, more knowledgeable, but more confused.

I was either a Freshman or Sophmore in high school, and this one older kid told me he could have OBE's and spy on his girlfriend.  I thought that was so cool at the time, and this is what initially sparked my interest.  =)

Since I was a child, I was aware of beings I could not see.  When I was three, I called them angels and was fascinated by them, staring at their likenesses in Christmas books and jumping off the arm of the sofa in my living room, trying to "fly" as they did.  In a dream I approached a group of them and asked for wings so that I could fly for real.  They handed me my pink and white checked dress, and I was so disappointed.  But I want wings, I insisted.  They insisted I take the dress.  So, my first memory of magical instruction was of being told I was a human, not an angel, and that I should go about my task of experiencing life as a human child.  Years later I figured that once I reached adulthood I'd be off the hook, claim my birthright as a magical being, and cease to be human.  (And the universe laughed deeply.)
<br>
<br>
As a young woman in Minnesota I was surrounded by Native American culture and religion, and my friends took their advice from the animal totems of that culture, i.e.,  "The raven/wolf/eagle told me this."  Since the only animals who ever spoke to me said things like "Feed me! Pet me!  Clean my box!" I thought I was spiritually undeveloped.  As it turned out, for my time and place I was simply unfashionable.  I spent a lot of time on the reservations doing volunteer work, majored in native american studies in college, and even learned how to speak Dakota (Sioux).  However, no matter how hard I tried I was still just a white girl, never adopted by any tribe.
<br>
<br>
Somewhere in that timeframe I became an initiated witch.  My time with my first coven was short.  I thought the High Priest was trying to get into my pants and on a power trip, and I was too uncomfortable there, so I split.  I still keep in touch with the high priestess (they've been doing this for decades and still have a coven) but the priest never spoke to me again after I left.  Several years later I joined a Dianic coven and spent a few happy years with them.  Then, I became connected with a celtic traditional coven several hours away from where I live.
<br>
<br>
I still keep in contact with my witch friends, but I don't practice a religion per se.  I consider myself a "solitary," a "seeker," someone genuinely interested in changing herself to meet a spiritual objective.  Many people say they are seekers and interested in metaphysics, spirituality, psychic development, etc., but are rarely willing to make the hard changes required to actually develop.  I want to think I'm actually committed to the work, the change, the hard choices . . . I think that's why I'm still banging away at it after 20 or 30 years!

Hi Bob
<br>
Four years ago I had a NDE. It made me aware of spiritual reality. It was the best(and very nearly the last) thing I`ve ever experienced.
