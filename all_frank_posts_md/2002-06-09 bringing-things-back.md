<section>
I have an interesting question.  And honestly it is something I have been trying to do since I was small.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible if even remotly to bring and object or some thing back with yuo when you AP, LD, or WILD?
<br>
<br>
Given the ability for some people to seemingly create objects out of thin air.  Or are they coming from the astral?

This is something I have tried to do on *many* occasions. At the time it feels so real, holding some object or other, that I feel certain I'll still be holding it upon my return to the Physical. But nothing has "crossed the bridge" as yet.

On another message board someone claims that they were having an obe and were in a store trying on clothes. When they woke up the clothes were there with them.

The questions springs mostly from this thought.  It is believed heavily that entities from the astral can physically manifest themselves on the physical plain.  So logic to me says that if a person can some up enough "will" or energy than they could bring some thing back with them.

In the book on dreaming by Carlos Castaneda, he mentions several times people bringing their physical bodies into the Dreaming with them. Usually they come back naked, but they might have started out that way. Bringing clothes along might be just wasted energy? The method for doing this was not clear to me, but I assume that given more experience it would be clearer.

Tom, it may have been you who got me reading that book. I'm glad you mentioned it, because he did have some interesting ideas. I like the part about SEEing energy in dreams and locating negs (scouts). However, the rest of the book is crap! He gives the reader hopes of accomplishing this stuff, yet doesn't state how. It's written as a novel, wanting to be a true story. It's obvious that some of the stuff isn't true. Plus, why would you want to use your energy to take your physical body with you? I think traveling as an energy body is just fine.     ...Sorry about going off the subject!
