<section>
I have been on a rather dry spell lately with no really explanation way.  I have changed my diet recently and have been eating more meats and heavier foods and this could be the cause.  Well I made a mental note this morning just before going to sleep that I was going to go back to a vegetarian diet that I have practiced in the past.  I was extremely tired and thought I would fall into a deep sleep however I noticed every two or three minutes as I was beginning to fall asleep I would keep getting images of male faces looking at me close up.  This went on for awhile so I mentally decided to just go with it and enjoy what my subconscious or higher self was trying to show me.  I assume what happened next was a so called Phasing as I found myself in what appeared to be a dirt street that was full of people and store fronts with a lot of kiosks also.  I was very lucid and at first thought I was in Indonesia.  I was excited as I plan on going there this year and thought I could explore a bit.  The people however did not appear to be Indonesian as I observed them more closely and I was a bit disappointed.  They appeared to be either Indian or Pakistani and the women were all wearing saris.  The funny thing was as I would turn to view a different scene the field of view was complete but I felt as if it had just been created for my benefit.  I was still very lucid and as I walked down the street I kept looking at my hands as to keep lucid.   This went on for quite a few minutes and every once in a while I would make myself rise off the ground a few feet just for a thrill.  I walked to the end of several streets and occasionally thought about walking up to some one and looking at them closely but the overall experience in all it's brilliance of colors was keeping me satisfied.  I finally came to a beach and there were also alot of people on it also.  A very strong lighting storm started and I took shelter in a covered bazaar.  After a while the storm became worse and I made my way a couple blocks to an automobile that had two women in it that were also taking shelter.  Somewhere during the beach and the car however I became semi lucid and the experience ended shortly thereafter after entering the back seat of the car.  The things I see sometimes make it hard to believe this is all subjective.  The art work is too beautiful and the music too wonderful for me to believe I am creating all this.  Is there someone who can tell me in your experience the following?
<br>
Is this a Phasing?
<br>
What in Monroe's techniques focus level was I in?
<br>
Is this a lower level Astral?

according to monroe.
<br>
<br>
What makes you think it was a lower level Astral? Au contraire, you said that the colors were great making me think it was actually a higher level of the astral

<br>
<br>
As for wether or not it is subjective, I honestly dont know, maybe someone with more knowledge than me can help you out. I believe that it is subjective, perhaps your astral senses are naturaly more developed?
<br>
<br>
Anyways i envy you(i have yet to project, just started practicing 4 days ago) and it seems like you may have some talent. Keep it up

Yes, I thought it was a great experience and that is why I wanted to share it.  A lot of times when I find myself in this area the colors are incredibly brilliant.  I can sometimes look through boxes of paintings that are as beautiful as anything painted by Van Gough or Monet.  The music is mostly Indian in nature and most beautiful and the poetry I hear is also fantastic too.  It is hard to believe I am not just an observer to this astral.  If I am creating this what a shame that due to objective experience to the physical for so long I have lost all my ability to paint these beautiful things and create beautiful works of art.  You say this could be my Astral and perhaps you are right as I am still not too experienced but I am reminded of the movie "What Dreams May Come" where Robin Williams is told after he dies that he is creating all that he sees, that that is his world. That is a great concept.

Is this Phasing?
<br>
<br>
Phasing is not so much a technique but an approach that relates to a particular model of consciousness. The Phasing model holds the promise of being able to circumvent traditional "exit symptoms" such as vibrations and so forth. As you appear not to have had those kinds of symptoms, so to speak, then your experience could be said to have been aligned to the Phasing model in certain respects.
<br>
<br>
The Monroe focus level, from what you describe, I would judge to be Focus 24. In terms of the Phasing model, I would say you were experiencing Focus 3 as your primary focus but with the occasional Focus 2 overlay.
<br>
<br>
Was this the lower Astral? The astral realms model is a more traditional, i.e. mystical, belief construct. There are no actual "astral realms" as such. What mystics generally term astral-realms is Focus 2 of consciousness. But there are all manner of variations that have been created over the many, many years these notions have been propagating to the extent where it's impossible to make sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
Which is why people such as myself and no-doubt Monroe, rather than try to untangle the mess, found it far easier to simply create a more modern-day model of consciousness, and one that actually related to the wider reality... rather than peoples old-age superstitions about the wider reality.
<br>
