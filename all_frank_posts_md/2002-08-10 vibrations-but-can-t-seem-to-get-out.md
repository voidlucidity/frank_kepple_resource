I am able to get strong vibrations and everything, but the one thing I can't do is get out. Its like I'm being held there. Is this an issue of my energy body? Should I work on that more? I know I had a deep enough level of relaxation because I had been asleep the whole night, then woke up and went into the vibrations.
<br>
Thanks

At first the vibrational characteristics can be such that they are not refined enough for take-off and/or your protective aspect of your sense of conscious awareness is holding you back.
<br>
<br>
If you bathe in them for a short while, you find the vibrations turn into a buzzing sensation at which point you should take off no problem.
