Hey all..
<br>
I was wondering if I could have some info on attachments to the energy body by outside entities?
<br>
<br>
I've just discovered that I have two (maybe one?) entities attached to my feet, taking vital energy. This has been the cause of serious enrgy problems for the past year - and I just realised 2 days ago...boy was I angry!
<br>
<br>
So, I've been at them with Rapido and standard NEW brushing, but I would really like some more info on them - how else to get rid of them (these suckers are putting up a fight), mainly, but also what they are, how/why they attached themselves to me, how to avoid them, etc.
<br>
<br>
ANY advice would be much appreciated. Thanks

Well, just like any parasite, they want to live, and your energy is lunch.  Try sensing around to see if they have "roots" running up through your nervous system.

Thanks for the tip, Wolf
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I did suspect something like that at first, as my lower primary and secondary centres are not very active, but I dismissed it at first because it seems pretty 'hardcore' - ie. a parasite burrowing itself all the way up my legs, and into several primary centres!!
<br>
<br>
BUT - your post made me look twice, and now i think that is the case. So now I'm working from the top down - brushing my highest affected enrgy centres and working down.
<br>
<br>
If you have any more suggestions, or anyone else, (they're more embedded than I thought!) please post them. Thanks =D

Hey Adam,
<br>
These suckers have to have ahandle to grab in the first place!  Some small way in which you left yourself open to them.  In my experience this is generally a concept something like anger, jealousy, self incrimination, embarassment, etc.  If you get rid of the handle, you get free and stay free.  -Jon

Hey there
<br>
<br>
You could also try the Core Image Removal exercise on the attachment point. And as egollum suggested it may have a trigger in the external world. One thing you might try doing is "listening/feeling/sensing" it -- projecting Love Understanding Acceptance -- seeing it transform and grow into something positive.... One way of listening is rattling off the top of your head "the negative intention of.... {this attachment} is.... and just FORCE yourself to keep uttering, no matter how ridiculous or stupied it sounds. You'll know when you hit it by the instant feeling of lightness you may even laugh. Then is the time to implant something new, after sending it L U A.
<br>
<br>
Another one is to take on the energy field's viewpoint. Start of by looking at the attachment from the pov (point of view) of a cloud, of a rock, of anything you can think of. lighten up with this, flow and when you are comfy, then take the pov of the attachment -- you might be surprised!!!!
<br>
<br>
The above exercises are not Robert's but are extremely effective in dealing with many of life's issues and yes, negs or attachments.
<br>
<br>
There are many ways to skin a roo.
<br>
<br>
OH that's right, also look at your belief systems about how easy or hard this can/should be. remember healing can take place instantly.

<section>
Thanks for the advice everyone, much appreciated
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
This is turning out to be a much harder 'thing' to deal with than I thought.
<br>
First: I know something is attached to me - but - I don't know what it is.
<br>
Second: It's been attached for a fair while now and I want it to leave.
<br>
Third: I believe it's attached to an energy centre at the back of my head. This realization hit me two nights ago, and now I'm damn sure that's where it's attached - but I'm a little skeptical still, because I had the same realization with it being attached to my base shakra, my navel chakra, or my feet (although now I'm starting to think there's seperate entities there as well
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
).
<br>
<br>
This is different to when I thought it was attached to other areas, because it feels quite different at the back of my head. Not a good feeling. Now I'm suspecting the problems with the lower centres has been caused by: a) lack of energy coming up the legs and b) an inactive root chakra, which I've been working on activating (and it's been working - I'm slowly getting more energy).
<br>
<br>
Is it possible that this is some negative spirit? I've got two reasons for suspecting this:
<br>
a) The energy centre at the back of one's head is supposedly the connection to the spirit world.  I read this in a book written on human auras; the author said she could see something like 'cones of light' flashing onto that energy centre when someone was channeling a spirit.
<br>
b) I've had two dreams about an 'evil' spirit controlling me. The first was me flying around a room, but controlled by the spirit. I had an image of the spirit in the dream; it was like a skull formed from smoke. I wasn't worried in the dream, I just remained calm. That one was about 5-6 months ago. The second one was when my conciousness had carried over into sleep and in that first period of sleep, when we have heaps of short dreams, I had this lucid dream which was similar to the first - but in this one, I was being flown around my room (last one was at a friend's), it was totally dark (I could see about 5 feet in front of me then it dropped off into total darkness), there was this evil laughter and I did *not* feel good. This one happened about a month ago.
<br>
<br>
So yeah...*phew* lots to say there
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
I've been trying to send it love, but I'm also trying to find love myself, so it's not easy. I'm hopeless at visualization atm and I'm just not sre what to do about it. But I AM confident I will rid myself of it, whatever it is. I don't what want to live with it any longer.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening and for helping.

This actually makes it more typical.  Most of the critters I have seen attached to people attach to the back of the head.  All the better to tamper with your nervous system, right at the CPU, see?
<br>
But I've not found them that hard to remove, just a matter of containing them and pulling them away.  Just need to make sure that they're not hooked into anything delicate in there.  Some of 'em will hook into the pain center so trying to remove them causes pain.  Might have to track down and confine every "tendril" the thing has out, and clip them seperately to make sure.
<br>
The one I dealt with was simple, I just pulled it right off and no harm done, but the longer it's been there, the more time it's had to study your system.
<br>
<br>
The one removed from my heart area by a friend years ago had been there many years, and it hurt like you wouldn't believe--left scarring, too....maybe purely energetic, I'm not sure, but I get some pain still when too much energy goes through that area.

<section>
I think along the same lines as Egollum...usually one allows such entities to attach in some way, usually due to some unconscious weakness or negative habit.
<br>
<br>
I would continue to practice excercises to purge these attachments, but introspection and self-improvement...although seemingly "simple" are truly the most effective, as well as difficult, methods of brushing away negative energy.

 Greetings Winged Wolf and everyone!
 <br>
 <br>
 I regard this as an important topic, because I believe this energy parasite problem is much more common than people think. Aside from higher energy parasites, there are also "larvae" which feed of sick or injured people, taking advantage of their vulnerabilities and generally weakened physical and mental state.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am interested in how you "see" these entities attached to people?
 <br>
 <br>
 Generally, a good thing to try, is visualise bathing yourself in spiritual bright white light. Visualising a pentagram with gas blue flames over the area of the attachment might be worth a try as well - it depends on how "high" these entities are as to whether that would scare them away. Let us all know how you get on.
 <br>
 <br>
 Kind regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian.

I remember having a large attachment right at my root chakra, which manifested itself as a large mole. Every day for 2 months, I moved energy through the spot, and one bright afternoon as I was doing energy work, I suddenly felt an explosion of energy in my root chakra. When I looked down there that night, the mole was gone, and hasn't been back since

<section>
I would use the term "see" very loosely, beause I only occasionally get visuals, usually when I'm working at a distance.  In such cases, I generally see the person's field, and a blob/sphere (whatever shape the thing is) of energy which is of a different pattern attached to or within a portion of their field.  This can come across as being a different color from their field.  I usually get a sense of how large it is in comparison with their field, and also it's relative density (these two things can help me determine how strong it's likely to be).  If it's got tendrils or connections, I see those as well once I check for them.
<br>
<br>
Depending on what I'm looking for, I'm used to seeing just that on a simplified level--it makes it easier to deal with it.  (If I were looking for injuries, I'd see them as darkened places in the field--if I'm looking for entities, I'm less likely to pick up on the injuries unless they are extreme--that sort of thing).  Some of the information is unfiltered, so I "just know" additional things about what's going on, rather than seeing it or feeling it or whatnot.

<section>
Adam,
<br>
bear in mind that these creatures can have many different attachment points all over your body, so you are probably right in all 3 areas. Good luck kicking it off! Approaching problems like this from as many different angles as possible seems to be the best way.

Wow! So many replies =D
<br>
<br>
Thanks folks...I've been taking in everything and applying it to my situation.  So..working on the attachment point(s) is not enough - I have to work on the tendrils? Man...this f*cker is stuck right into my system. I've sensed them coming down the back of my spine and back of my legs for a while. They seem to be stuck deeply in my knees as well. I think I'm going to have to concentrate mostly on my root chakra atm, but I'm going to attack those tendrils

(thx winged wolf).
<br>
<br>
Meditation is becoming easier - when I've worked the head attachment point, I get the errant thoughts less and less (also ones like 'Don't think!'
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.

Anyway, all I can do now is throw myself into the problem. But any more advice is much much appreciated.

Hi Adam -
<br>
<br>
Besides the dreams, what is telling you that what is happening to you is neg energy attachment:  could you very specifically describe what  the sensations are that you're experiencing at the points of attachment (it sounds like your being attacked by an energetic octopus
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
; and, what mental/emotional things are occuring?  You've described quite a bit so far I know, but I'm not getting a clear picture of what exactly it is that you're experiencing here.....  specifically I'm wondering about the sensations at the back of your neck/skull, and down your spine.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>

Hi Adam,
<br>
you mentioned being angry at this 'spirit' attached to you. For now the best advice i can give you is not to show it any emotion at all, if possible. Your anger will only leave you open to Obsession by said spirit.
<br>
In "The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage" translated by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, a certain point is persistantly made. I quote;
<br>
<br>
"And immediately, on beholding your steadfastness, they will obey you; but should they not, you ought then to Invoke your Guardian Angel, whose chastisement they will quickly feel.
<br>
Yet, notwithstanding, we should never employ harsh means,in order to have that which we can obtain by gentleness and courtesy*"
<br>
<br>
There is a note by Mathers
<br>
*"Let me here once again insist on the absolute necessity in Occult work of being courteous,
<i>
 even to Evil Spirits
</i>
; for the Operator who is insolent and overbearing will speedily lay himself open to obsession by a Spirit of like nature."
<br>
<br>
This book is all about the evocation of various spirits in order to subject them to the Mages Will. The advice in your circumstance , i think, is still relevant. Try to keep a watchful eye on your emotions like anger etc and keep them under control.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes
<br>
<br>
McArthur

I can't really agree or disagree with that entirely--I once killed something off by getting really mad at it, though.

 <br>
 Anger increases one's energy level--that can feed a parasite, yes, but it can also feed your own abilities, if you know what to do with it.
