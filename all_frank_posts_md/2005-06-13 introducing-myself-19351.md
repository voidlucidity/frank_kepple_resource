<section>
Firstly, I would like to say a big HELLO to everyone here at 'Astral Pulse'!!
<br>
Secondly, I would like to introduce myself to you all. I'm 'Astral Vibe', I got my name from the one experience I've had. I am 16 years old and live in Birmingham, United Kingdom. I found your forum from a link on another forum, as it caught my eye. I've been looking for a place to talk about Astral Projection for ages and finally here I am!
<br>
<br>
So anyway... here's my story... About a year ago, I nearly collapsed at a hospital. My mother had been in a car crash and I went to visit her. (It wasn't a serious accident, just one of those bumps). I was sitting on the arm of the chair that my father was sitting on. When all of a sudden I couldn't hear and I had tunnel vision. The nurse sat me down with my head between my legs to get some air. Then I got my hearing back and my vision. I then went outside with my dad for some fresh air. After this incident, when my mother had came out of hospital. I never felt the same. I had a strange feeling in my head, permanently. I even went to see phyciatrists about it and they thought it was just nerves that had brought it all on.
<br>
<br>
Later on though, about a month away from when I nearly fainted. I was surfing the net and a pop-up came up. About some book to do with Astral Projection. I nearly closed it, but then I decided to click it for some reason. I then started searching all over the net about it as I grew fascinated by it. I found information about the 'Suneye Method' of projecting. Then decided to try it out.
<br>
<br>
Days and days I tryed and learnt to meditate. I found it extremely easy to meditate and then after a week of trying the method. One night around 3am I started to shake violently. I knew this was normal as I had read about the vibrations you get before you project. I lay there in my bed on my back, shaking and shaking. I couldn't move at all. So then I was scared and thought surely this isn't real. I thought perhaps I was epileptic (as my mom is). So scared I was that the vibrations stopped abruptly. I then told my mom I wanted to be tested for Epilepsy. So I was.
<br>
<br>
About two weeks later I had an EEG scan. They said I was clear, to my amazement. It was then I realized that I had actually came really close to projecting and then I believed. So I then called my net name 'Astral Vibe' after the violent vibrations I endured. Ever since that time, I have never been able to get that close to projecting. Now I am ready to actually let the vibrations carry on. As I want to project. I just know I am ready. All I need to do is get those vibrations back and not be scared by them. If anyone has any useful information to help me get them back. I will greatly appreciate it. Thankyou for your time in reading this.
