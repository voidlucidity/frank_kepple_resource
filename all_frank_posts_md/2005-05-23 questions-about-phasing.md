I am quite new to phasing and have a few questions about focus 2. When trying to make the transition to focus 2 does it help to keep the mind clear of thoughts or does it help to use a technique like Selski described about bouncing on a trampoline.  I know in some of your post you said just go with the flow but i find when trying to phase i get distracted by thoughts which then tend to turn into dreams.  When the transition is made do you find yourself out of body in focus 2 or do you end up where ever your mind takes you.  I am a complete beginner at phasing and just want some guidance on the subject.

I'm currently finding it a bit of a "halfway house"
<br>
<br>
If I concentrate on some imagery, the concentration is too tension-inducing, and prevents me from relaxing into a trance state.
<br>
<br>
So I generally go with keeping my mind clear. However, when I reach the state where imagery starts appearing, I can sometimes induce &amp; control imagery such as going down stairs, and then it's very helpful.

I find that when trying to stop pervasive thoughts it is very difficult i guess it gets easier with the more you attempt phasing.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The mind should not be clear of thoughts. I'm not sure where people get this idea. It's probably through some kind of meditation something or other. You need to create a mental rundown in order to make "the switch". Reason being, your imagination is held within Focus 2 of consciousness. This is the area where most people dream, or act out some other construct such as "astral projection", and a whole load of things besides. They all tend to be actions that take place within Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
The approach I suggest uses Focus 2 of consciousness as a kind of "launch pad" to take you to other areas of consciousness. In particular Focus 3. This is where the fun stuff takes place. Anyone wanting "proof" about "life after death" and such like needs to project to Focus 3 of consciousness. You can project direct to Focus 3 of consciousness but beginners have to begin somewhere and I believe it is far easier and far more understandable for beginners to comprehend the transition to Focus 2 first. Then use this as a launch pad to Focus 3.
<br>
<br>
So it doesn't just
<i>
 help
</i>
to use a technique like Sarah described, the whole transition is formed on the basis of it. Otherwise how are you going to make the transition?
<br>
<br>
You can try "coming awake" within a dream and then attempt to Phase-shift to Focus 3 of consciousness, but this is unreliable due to the fact that no matter how hard you try, most people simply cannot quite "come awake" to the extent necessary to make a controlled transition. So what we do, in effect, is create a highly controlled and highly conscious "dream" if you like. Where you find yourself stepping into your "dream". But you do that fully conscious and fully knowing exactly what it is you are doing. This puts you right in the middle of Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Here you have two choices:
<br>
<br>
1)   you can go and fly around, and revel in your belief constructs about whatever it is takes your fancy. Have an astral projection experience, or experience any other belief construct you happen to subscribe to... or...
<br>
<br>
2)   you can transition to another area in your consciousness continuum.
<br>
<br>
If you want to step outside of the typical traditional mystical experience, then you need to transition to Focus 3. This is the essential difference between what Monroe was typically experiencing in his later work, versus the people who subscribe to the more traditionalist views.
<br>
<br>
If you are having thoughts that turn into dreams then you are not creating an absorbing enough rundown for yourself. Or you are trying when you are too tired and ready for sleep, or a combination of the two. If you get bored in your rundown then simply make it more interesting for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for clearing that up for me Frank I feel I now have a better understanding of phasing and will be experiencing focus2 in no time.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again
