I've been trying to obe for about a year, but not as a habit just once in a while. Lately I've been reading more and trying harder and yesterday I felt like I was getting closer. What i did was I relaxed myself while listening to a BWGen preset. After a half hour, the preset ended and I just laid down and stared into my eyelids. I tried not to think about the past, it was all about what was going on at the time. Colorful moving patterns began to appear when I stared into my eyelids and then weird things started happening. First of all, I could see right through my eyelids.. It wasn't very clear, but I could see where the corner of the room was, I could also see my bookshelf. I looked around my room with my eyes closed for a little bit, and then I got really tired and all of a sudden I saw trees right in front of my eyes. For a second I thought I was looking out my window but then I noticed my back was to the window. This excited me a little too much and then the trees were gone. I think I may have seen the trees at a pond that I always try to go to when I try to obe. Maybe it was remote viewing, who knows? After that, I didn't get any more positive results so I just went to sleep.

<br>
Soon I'm gonna have a full OBE, now I know that I can do it.

That's the Monroe Focus-12 state. It comes about as you switch your focus of awareness from the Physical, to within the expanse of your mind. As you do so, you begin to perceive with your non-physical senses.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, as you have found out, in the beginning you tend to experience what I call the Fish Out Of Water effect. It's where everything seems topsy-turvy and things keep shifting here and there, and you can't seem to make any concrete sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
Problem was, you touched on entering a realm where thought equals action. Which means you need to practice keeping your thoughts in check at all times. Otherwise things will just flit from one event to the next, and you'll keep getting zapped out of it.
<br>
<br>
One thing I can confirm is you *are* getting closer.
<br>
<br>
You should find that things tend to roll along of their own accord from the Focus-12 state. So let the experience unfold and, chances are, you'll end up within the 3D Blackness at Focus-21, or you might skip this and end-up seeing some vision or other (which is what happened with you with the trees). When this happens, remain very calm and try placing a mental intent to "step into" the vision.
<br>
<br>
Because just beyond that vision, is where all the "fun stuff" takes place.
