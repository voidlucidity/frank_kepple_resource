Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Yes, the new record is 31
<b>
 concurrent
</b>
users, i.e. online at exactly the same time. Total visitors for the day would be much higher.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Active Users Record: 31 | Record Set On: 04 June 2003 at 03:28:15
</b>
<br>
<br>
In addition, we have reached over 600 posts in less than four days so far this month, and over 37,000 in total.
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed everyone for your much valued support and contributions.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I am pleased to advise that I think I have solved the problem that was max'ing out the CPU's over the last few days,and this new record is excellent evidence of that [

This forum does have a definite "pulse". In the past, I have visited and stayed only so briefly, at other not so lively astral forum sites. However, the Astral Pulse has a rapid beat, and there is much going on here. It remains the best place to exchange views and learn about all things "astral".

Very best,
