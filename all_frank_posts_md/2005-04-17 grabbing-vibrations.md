I have never actively attempted to induce vibrations. I just relax and start letting my body just go with the flow and figure it out.  I have had success up until now.  I can get into a deep deep trance, I actually feel like I'm in another body, but when I move it is the physical or I am practically paralyzed ( I can move, but it feels like too much effort and I don't want to break the trance).  There is no separation symptoms and no vibrations.  My old technique has ceased to work for seemingly no reason.
<br>
I had 1 obe and 2 lucid dreams practically at will last week, but nothing since then.
<br>
<br>
The only times I have successfully made it clear of my body into the RTZ has been accompanied by vibrations that came mysteriously.  I have had 3 obes without vibrations, but they put me in more of a very lucid dream than anything.  How do you guys induce vibrations?  I have attempted the instructions given in Journeys out of the Body which I recently purchased, but it hasn't worked for me yet.  I figure at this point I am finally forced to face the fact that I cant obe until I can induce vibrations myself, and not wait for them to come to me.  Would my other experiences without vibrations be phasing?  I can only phase accidentally it seems.  Any input would be awesome.

I'd like to know this as well.

I, too, recently purchased Journeys Out of the Body and have been trying this vibration technique. The only result I've achieved is rapid twitching on my physical face. (?)
<br>
<br>
Last week, I felt the vibrations for the first time, but I have no idea how I got there, and it was before I received the book. They also went away rather quickly.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I used to get vibrations all the time up until a few years ago when I began the initial work on what became my Phasing Model. I found the vibrations came from a particular interaction between the two energy centres purple and yellow. Nowadays I hardly ever get them unless I activate these areas, which I have no real need to do. In my Phasing approach, you should not get any vibrations or any kind of exit-symptoms at all.
<br>
<br>
Vibrations tend to come as a result of people shifting their perception about within Focus 1 of consciousness, for example, energy-work or RTZ projection. These are actions that take place within F1oC. Vibrations are symptomatic of the various perception shifts that people can initiate within this area of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
With Phasing, you seek not to merely shift your perception within one particular area in consciousness. With Phasing, you keep your perception as it is, and set-out to initiate a phase-shift in your actual
<i>
 area
</i>
in consciousness. This is a different action entirely. It is interesting that if you phase-shift to Focus 2 of consciousness and
<i>
 then
</i>
start shifting your perception about within Focus 2, in a similar way to how people do within Focus 1, you can
<u>
 also
</u>
get vibrations, still remain within Focus 2 of consciousness, but experience them as an F2/F1 overlay.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

you never fail to blow my mind frank.  Getting vibrations in f2???  I guess the combinations are endless!

Thanks for the input.  I have been having problems with phasing when I try to phase.  Even if the thought if phasing was in my initial mind as I began practice, I can not phase.  If I am attempting to obe, and then kind of just think "forget about'it" and go into a trance for a while I tend to start to phase, but cant complete it.  I guess once I thought the roadblocks where clear new ones decided to fall in place.  I will re-read your peace on phasing and give it a shot.  Thanks again.

Instead of focusing on your immediate area- i.e. your room, do a mental rundown. For example, imagine yourself walking in the country and try to use all your physical senses. Imagine you hear music coming from a house, or smell a pie baking. Engage your senses withint yourself and pretty soon you should find yourself at the famous "3d blackness" The first time you get there you will probably shoot right back to C1 just because of the shock of it(at least i did last night).
<br>
<br>
But if you can learn to hold the 3d blackness, which i think is F2oC, im told great things can happen. You can let your imagination run wild, and engage in any construct youd like. You can also go "backwards"(in linear terms) to the RTZ if you wish. But if you want to go further you can phase further into F3 or F4. And there is much more info in some other posts if you want to use the search feature to find them. Im off to bed

Wow that sounds like a fun time! Its amazing the way our thoughts and emotions totally shape the environment. I cant wait to get into F2oC myself, but i gotta take it one step at a time

I don't seem to be getting vibrations or any exit sensations anymore.  I used to focus on rolling out from the mind awake/body asleep state and the vibes would start.  The vibrations aren't needed but they did seem to shock me into having more lucidity since they can be intense.
<br>
<br>
Now that the vibes and exit sensations are gone lately I have no idea how it is that I'm ending up out of body.  It just sort of happens without any awareness of how I got there before I find myself in an AP.  I've had about 150 projections with and without vibrations but the sad thing is that I don't think I've ever made it past F2 besides for a few RTZ experiences.

well while we are on the topic of vibrations, last night I was laying in bed and I was rembering a dream I had where I was standing infront of a glowing pool which had butterflys fluttering above it, It was completely dark around the pool and the butterflys looked like monarchs, except where there was color on their wings it was glowing the same color as the pool.  So I was getting some viberations, but i dont know what to do next.. If I think about the vibrations they fade but i cant figure out how to make them stronger, another thing that happened was at some point my mind started to wonder and I was walking along this walkway, I am not sure if it was me or not but this being was playfully jumping in the air and hitting these little glowing balls of light, kinda like popping bubbles when ur a kid, it said in a kind of whisper "I am the angel of mercy" then i looked around behind it, and saw a person wearing a browm jacket and jeans with his head cocked to one side at which point i lost it..
<br>
<br>
so...
<br>
<br>
how do I increase vibrations if when I think about them they dissapear?

When I was 15 (14 years ago),I read Journeys Out Of The Body.I practiced "grabbing the vibrations" for about 2 weeks,then *something* shot down out of the sky,went straight into my crown chakra,and proceeded to sweep up and down my body.I felt like every atom in my body was being shook apart-almost like a massive electrocution feeling.
