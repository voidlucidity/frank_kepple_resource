i was wondering if the brain wave CD stuff really helps and if its worth the money. i am good at getting to focus 10 but then i dont know what to do. i lay there feeling very odd indeed. i read im supposed to get comfortable with each step i take so i lay for a LONG time in focus 10, sometimes for hours and i feel very comfortable and unafraid and peacful in focus 10, but i dont know how to get to focus 12 or more. i was thinking if the CD's would help put me in the right frame of mind or if they only work a little bit. repleys would be greatly appreciated [^]

hi,
<br>
Hemi -Sync has helped me a lot when speaking of ability to relax and reaching the focusses. I love te sensation that it leaves in my brain..this tingling feeling, and I swear that I feel like my brain is getting a really gooooood massage;)
<br>
I've never had an obe while listening to the cd's, but I get 95% of them minutes AFTER I've had a hemi-sync session, when i just lay down and relax.
<br>
ofcourse hemi-sync has got many more benefits..
<br>
there have been some really good posts explaining it all, but I can't find them;( maybe someone else from the forum has better memory than me;)
<br>
good luck!

In my opinion, no.  Hemi-sync is a type of hypnotism.  Some of them are music, but much of them have words to them, spoken by Monroe himself.  I have 2 of them.  One is just calming music, and though I find it quite comforting, has nothing to do with OBE whatsoever.  The other is a spoken CD in which Monroe guides you through a relaxing journey untill you reach a point that "pink sound" comes in and you are suppose to experience a very personal spiritual experience.  But if you've ever tried to be hypnotised or seen it done, you will recognize that Monroe uses tone of voice and soothing phrases that in a normal situation would simply hypnotise many people.  I however can't be hypnotised (ya ya, "everyone" can be hypnotised, simpy not true).  I find all Hemi-Sync CD's very relaxing and pleasant to listen to, but they will in no way, shape, or form induce an OBE, unless you can be hypnotised, in which case it's still not an OBE.  If you wish to ease some tension and feel some comfort, then go for it.  But don't expect and OBE solely from listening to Hemi-Sync.

Congratulations on being able to achieve the focus 10 state so easily. I think what you need to do now is gather a little more intent to do something in particular. It's hard to say whether any particular CD would help you. Because it seems what works for one does not necessarily work with another. I had some tremendous success with the Hemi-Sync Wave 1 CD, for example. Yet there are people who have tried it with mixed success or even none at all.
<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is maybe for you to concentrate on something in mind. Say, think of opening a some kind of pathway and walking off down it. Your imagination is a key player here. Some people imagine stepping into a mirror, others think of some kind of symbol such as the kind you see on Tarot cards, for example. Basically you can think of just about anything provided it has something to do with looking towards crossing the barrier between the physical into the non-physical.
<br>
<br>
What you are basically doing is focussing your attention away from the physical (where it is usually focussed) into the non-physical. And to do that people normally need a little meta-physical imagery to kick-start the process. At first you will perceive yourself from the point of view of you looking at whatever it is you are imagining. But after a while, and how long it will take varies greatly between people, you will suddenly realise that you have in some way "stepped into" the image you were previously thinking about.
<br>
<br>
The shock of this realisation will almost certainly snap you right back to physical the first, maybe, 5 or 6 times it happens, or maybe even the first 10 or 20 times... it all depends on the individual. But with practice you will learn to stay emotionally neutral, so you can then begin to explore your new non-physical surroundings.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
