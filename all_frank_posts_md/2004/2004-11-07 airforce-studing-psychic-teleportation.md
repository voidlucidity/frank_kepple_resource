It's just yet another example (as if any more were needed) of a sick society. Not content with killing one another on a physical level, these vile morons want to do it on a spiritual level as well.

The PDF version of the Paper is available at....

It is called Teleportation Physics Study..  not Psychic Teleportation.  Although the ability to switch between awareness levels and places is mentioned in the study paper.
<br>
<br>
We should remember that the US has perfected Remote Viewing, even if there are a few books saying they didn't.  So we should also not be surprised to find that these types of Study Papers are usually only the tip of the much larger iceberg, and are mostly based after the fact of agency experimentation.
<br>
<br>
As an aside to this....  I often wondered how the Remote Viewing system worked in the US agencies until I read a book a few years ago by one of the operatives. (don't remember the name or title sorry)  He described the relatively strict procedure.. where the Viewer would get a phone call or be called into the 'office' and given a series of six-digit codes to use as a road map to the target designated for viewing.
<br>
<br>
Given that the US had Viewers communicating with 'Jesus', a variety of Alien races as well as the sensitive agencies they wanted information about etc, I was at a a loss to explain how the Viewer could reach a destination with only a series of code numbers to go by.
<br>
<br>
It made sense to me that the codes are like a map reference in time/space, but, how did the US agencies involved in the experiements KNOW what Codes took you to what places in different realities ?
<br>
<br>
I still don't have an answer for that quesion as yet.  Although I found over the years while Journeying that I went where I needed to go and when I wanted to do something specific I simply Intended to get there.
<br>
<br>
Once I was asked to do a specific job for someone and I had no idea where to go to find the race of beings I needed to get to, so I went out as usual and soon found myself at the place and with the Beings I wanted to Question.
<br>
<br>
From this I figured that as a huge Soul we must already KNOW where and when everything is and how to get there if we wanted to.... we ony had to intend it and let it happen.
<br>
<br>
That's my little bit for today.

How do you think we can kill each other on a spiritual level? I don't see how that's possible. In a less direct sense, I thought commercialism was sufficient for that. But in a direct sense? You don't even agree with negs.

I think you misunderstand what the codes are for. Basically, it's a description of the target in the most removed way. For instance, if you want a remote viewer to see what you have in your hand, their brain will get in the way by thinking of things that can be held in your hand. If you have someone propose a target to them, and the person doing the proposing has no idea what the target is himself, he just has an envelope with a code on it that corresponds to the actual target, then the chances of the remote viewing being tainted by subconcious guesswork is less.
<br>
<br>
There's probably other uses for the code as well, but in the way of the old Dewey library system.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I doubt the government has perfected the RV system very much, if at all. That would be neat if it did, though. But I'm more optimistic - sure the government is corrupt, but it is individuals that it comes down to who would be the actual substance behind a program like this. Not quite so faceless or amoral.
