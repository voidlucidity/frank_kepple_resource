<section>
spirit guides, angels etc are useless.
<br>
If one of you channeled an angel or a guide right now or whatever, there would be absolutely no way to prove that the guide really exists as an external being. That guide would not be able to tell me any information about myself, such as my middle name, or what color shirt I am wearing. There is absolutely nothing any of these entities can do to prove they actually externally exist. If asked to do one of these things, they were say that there is no need for them to do that for one reason or another.
<br>
I really don't see what use they are for. Anyone care to convince me otherwise?

Smiles,

A guide (for the sake of a label) will prove themselves if asked, but continually seek to open ones eyes to their presence regardless.

Hello AK,
<br>
<br>
Feeling like a bit of controversy for controversy's sake eh?
<br>
<br>
So, why should any spirit bother to prove themselves to anyone but the ones they are dealing directly with at the time?
<br>
<br>
Spirits do not come with trumpet fanfares and big budget lightshows to announce their existence to all. That's the stuff of religious mythology and James Randi followers.
<br>
<br>
And I'm not sure exactly how asking a guide about the colour of your shirt is going to be of benefit to me? The teachers of our spiritual evolution are not interested in parlour tricks.
<br>
<br>
Besides, proof, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

If proof is in the eye of the beholder then there would be no such thing as science as it is today. All things can be proved, and they can be proved to everyone, unless of course they do not exist.
<br>
It really takes no effort whatsoever (apparently for a spirit anyway) to determine the colour of my shirt and tell it to me, and if it can't 'help' then it can't 'hurt' can it?
<br>
I have also dealt with many 'spirits' before. Some of which, have proved their existance. If the teachers of 'our spiritual evolution' as you put it, are not interested in proving themselves, then doesn't that mean they've potentially lost hordes of people who would hop on the spiritual evolution band wagan
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
?
<br>
The fact is, this can be directly proved, as science has shown. When you ask for proof from a spirit of its existance, but apparently you need to 'look harder' or have you eyes open, whats the point of that? then I will perceive things that would have already happened if I had not asked for proof, and accept them as proof.
<br>
Also, if you are *channeling* a spirit through your own body there is pretty much no way for it to prove if it is external unless it physically moves something with telekinisis. Unless you do something like determining say, the colour of someones shirt on the other end of long distance communications...
<br>
Think long and hard. Has your 'spirit guide' ever done anything that has really benefited you? Has it ever done anything other then acting like an LSD guru, like say, telling you the winning lottery numbers?

Actually, yes.
<br>
<br>
Once I was locked out of my house.  I circled three times checking and rechecking windows and doors.  All locked.  I sat down in frustration.  Then the voice of my spirit guide came and said "Check the window behind your bed."  I had already checked it, so I felt silly, but I walked over to that side of the house.
<br>
<br>
It was OPEN.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, last weekend my Spirit Guides were strongly urging me to turn back on a drive I was taking into the city.  I've been on retreat up in the mountains for weeks.  They were really telling me to turn around.  But I was determined to go and visit my friend.
<br>
<br>
The first part of the trip was fine.  Roads were clear.  Then I came upon a long stretch of road in horrible condition.  Snow, sleet, ice.  It was the most frightening drive I have ever taken.  I found out later that the road I'd been driving on was officially closed.
<br>
<br>
Then I got into town and the friend I was visiting was sick the whole time.
<br>
<br>
If only I had listened.....

<br>
But that is such a 3-d materialist standard of whether or not the spirit guide is useful.  If winning the lottery is not part of your soul purpose, why would the guide bother?  It's not easy communicating between dimensions, there must be a good reason to do so.
<br>
<br>
Also, lottery numbers are generated by machines.  There is no human consciousness behind them.  This makes them difficult to predict.
<br>
<br>
<br>
aryanknight666, I respect your left-brain sobriety about not just blindly believing.
<br>
<br>
No point in being believers attached to the love and light paradigm.  Darkness exists.
<br>
<br>
However, just as there is ignorance in blindly believing, there is ignorance in being too skeptical.  Doubt can be something we hide behind out of fear.

<section>
Shinobi,
<br>
<br>
Well written.  You make a good point.
<br>
<br>
The balance is in experiencing both inner knowing and outer proofs.
<br>
<br>
No matter how great the guru, you still must take responsibility for your own free will choices and remain awake.  Too many want to just fall in line like sheep, because most people do not want to be responsible.
<br>
<br>
Usually the best state of mind is the one that says, "I know that I do not know".  That beginner's mind....staying fresh and open.
<br>
<br>
Neither blindly believing nor skeptically disbelieving.
<br>
<br>
But I have to stress that some kinds of knowing are subjective and cannot be proven in 3d material scientific forums....but they are still legitimate forms of knowing.  They are experiential.

<section>
I find it interesting when "science" is brought into debates like this.
<br>
<br>
What exactly has science proven?
<br>
Well, a few hundred years ago science proved that the world was flat, and then some years later it proved that the earth was the centre of the universe. It also proved that radio waves were transmitted by something called Ether, and more recently it proved that peanuts cause cancer.
<br>
Amazing proof there!
<br>
<br>
What is science but the orderly arrangement of the facts
<i>
 as we currently understand them.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Science in its purest form is not about proving things, its about
<i>
 understanding
</i>
things.
<br>
<br>
When studying those things which is considered beyond the reach of current science, such as spirits, psychic abilities and the astral, perhaps we would do better to not seek proof, but instead seek understanding.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
James.

<section>
Great post, Shinobi....as a rational person, I don't believe everything that people tell me. Instead, I look for
<b>
 personal
</b>
evidence or proof. With respect to the matter at hand (channelling / the paranormal /etc), this proof may be objective or subjective.
<br>
<br>
Whilst I disagree with Aryanknight's semantics, can I put some words into his mouth?!
<br>
<br>
"If one of you channeled an angel or a guide right now or whatever, there would be absolutely no
<b>
 scientific
</b>
way to
<b>
 objectively
</b>
prove that the guide really exists as an external being,
<b>
 at this moment in time
</b>
."
<br>
<br>
Hi James S ! you make a great point that science is only as current as our understanding of the universe, but I feel that the examples you mentioned were not theories, merely hypotheses &amp; as such were never considered as proofs.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, science is defined as being the study of the
<b>
 material
</b>
world, using
<b>
 human reason
</b>
. It is a tool that can only measure things that can be observed..... So perhaps it has no place in this discussion !!!
<br>

Understanding is attained through experience, and thus, you gain knowledge from that experience, making you understand it. Personal science, if you will.
<br>
<br>
While I do agree things beyond explanation should be given a shot, anyone who hasn't experienced it should definitely not believe in it. Otherwise you lose your objectivity, it gets clouded.

</blockquote>
<br>
If you consider the spirit telling something to me that the channeler could not possibly know as scientific proof, then perhaps you are correct. But to be correct in the area of terminology it would not be scientific proof but actually just logic, and if logic doesn't apply to anything about these spirits and their wonderful la la land then we get to the 'dragon in my garage' state of things and by that 'logic' I can say that there is a lava hat on my head and it exists, even though you cannot see it, touch it, hear it, smell it, feel it, taste it, and also even though you can run your hands through the area over the top of my hand and clearly see there is nothing solid there or anything giving off heat. It is just there and it just exists because I say it is, and you cannot say 'well you just made that up' because there is no concept of logic here and as such there is no difference to it actually being there and me making it up, it just exists.
<br>
<br>
I take back that everything can be proved, as well. I cannot prove for example, that the person writing this is the same person who wrote my other posts, I cannot prove that I am male, or that I am even a person and not a bot, I cannot prove that I am who I say I am or anything I say about myself and my identity. Which means that just because one of you says your guide stands there in front of you, there is no way for you to prove that that actually happens and there is no way for me to know if you are lying.
<br>
<br>
But, I can prove if someone actually has superpowers because they say they do. If they are standing in front of me, and I tell them to use whatever superpowers they claim to have, and after several trials and conditions they cannot do what they say they can do, then I have proved they do not have superpowers.
<br>
If someone says that, if you fill a container up half with water, put a floating candle in there and light it, then put the lid on, it will burn out in exactly 6 seconds every time with these conditions, then I can prove them wrong if I actually set up these conditions and after several trials and the time for the candle burning out is not the same every time under those conditions.

Dear Aryanknight666,
<br>
<br>
You are not doing yourself any favours. Normally I would have edited/deleted your post, but have chosen to leave it as it is!
<br>
<br>
Can I suggest as much as you may feel aggrieved that other users may be making digs at you or your opinion that you might consider that you are only enabling them to reflect back to you your own angst.
<br>
<br>
Whether you believe in Guides, Angels or fallen ones, helpers etc. does not matter a penny fig. Seek the blessing of knowing yourself. Speak to your own soul kindly. The inner guide that is you is there for you if you are ready to pay heed to the call. Open your heart without shame for past actions in this life or any previous incarnation.
<br>
<br>
You are part of all that is and is not! Seek forgiveness and offer forgiveness. You are LOVED as much as any one else here and deserve peace of mind with what is troubling you at this time.
<br>
<br>
No one here is really judging you - as you are the only one that can go through that process and will come out the eye of the needle reborn. Many of us here have had our own 'dark nights of the soul' - we recognise in you that these are dark days indeed for you.
<br>
<br>
If you need healing all you have to do is ask!

AK,
<br>
<br>
Even in the Darkness you advance the cause of Light.  In decrying something you doubt with your eyes, you in fact bring it strongly into the light.  See who and what supports higher entities, and who decries them, you have strongly influenced many minds on this site, but not the way the post was obviously intended (and what does that imply???, you catch more flies with vinegar than honey)
<br>
<br>
Yes I'm Judging, myself for offering a counter opinion, myself for wanting all my brothers/sisters to awaken NOW and not later.  But I'm also twisting the energies for those still asleep or just awakening.  It's what 'I Do'.  Home is now here, wake up an RE-MEMBER!
<br>
<br>
Thank You
<br>
-Namaste

Stephen,
<br>
<br>
I find AK's posts generous, even if they are not necessarily benevolent.  He metaphorically tosses the cat in among the pigeons, but the crap he stirs up was already there.
<br>
<br>
What I find interesting is that he's not just ignored as he would be if there wasn't a significant person behind the antics.  There's solid stuff there, and people respond.  Good things float to the surface almost in spite of the opening salvo.
<br>
<br>
It's almost like there's a need for a Warrior Society, where everybody climbs into the arena and takes the gloves off to really bash heads, no holds barred.  Some people get at what's real and true that only that way because they get distracted by the chaff otherwise.
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that belongs on Astral Pulse, it's just that there's a need for it and it has a certain legitimacy as a tool of evolution.
<br>
<br>
I studied with a Native American shaman who really needed that for himself.  His development was crippled until he found a circle of people where etherically bashing heads and slipping in stilettos was just friendly conversation.
<br>
<br>
I don't even want to WATCH if AK ever finds a place like that, but there are a fair number of people I know who would transform if they had any venue like that.   And a referee to call Time Out periodically.
<br>
<br>
Know of anything of the sort?

Hi Chimerae,
<br>
<br>
I appreciate what you are saying and I respect that challenge = opportunity for growth! How we rise to the challenge is another kettle of fish. As you know difficult life lessons get repeated until their truthful significance sinks in.
<br>
<br>
I would like to get back to on this one later and attempt to qualify (at least in part) as best I can the content of my previous post.
<br>
<br>
Aryanknight666,
<br>
<br>
Hope you do not think my approach towards you as facetious?
<br>
<br>
The thoughts were inspired and I hope that they have value for you! But to repeat myself: I would admit that they do require qualification on my part or at least follow on analysis in terms of the source of inspiration (if that is what it was). It may have been an ego response, although I do tend to question inspired thought (often) regardless! Perhaps if further developed this may lend weight to the original context of this discussion...  as you raise important questions regarding the source of guidance etc.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>

<section>
AK666 raises a very legitimate point about the difficulty of "proving" the existence of spirit guides.  We all know it is legitimate, and that's why it makes us react so.  Because we are frustrated at the difficulty of translating our experience into the 3d logical linear time paradigm.
<br>
<br>
And this is a serious issue because the fact that the existence of guides is not easy to prove in the materialist, rational, logical, scientific realm makes them easy fodder for exploitation.
<br>
<br>
Witness John Edward.  Sure, maybe he has a level of psychic ability, but he is a con artist for real, yo.  And we should rally against people like him.
<br>
<br>
The problem in our world today is we get caught up in these polarized debates.  I don't see AK666 as wrong and myself as right.  We both have pieces of the puzzle, and the synthesis of our observations will lead us closer to truth.
<br>
<br>
What underlies debates like these is the difference of left-brained and right-brained, yang and yin approaches to knowing and experiencing.  Our modern world is very much a left-brained, masculine yang paradigm and disrespects other ways of knowing.
<br>
<br>
Yes, this logical rational approach is excellent within its narrow range of experience....within the 3d material world of technology and linear time.
<br>
It has brought about a great deal of technological advancement (which is a mixed bag, but we are ALL benefiting from the Internet, for example...even though it might be mere training wheels until we become telepathic, but that's another story).
<br>
<br>
But there is no need to censor someone who is attached to that paradigm!  Are we that weak that we cannot stand some debate?  Hell no.  The truth of what we are observing and experiencing with our spirit guides is available for those who are willing to open to it.
<br>
<br>
Let's remember, awakening is a scary thing, it breaks your brains, it destroys all kinds of attachments to a certain paradigm within which you were raised and within which your network of human contacts exist.  It's not something that can be forced onto someone.  As much as it is a blessing it can be a curse, so let's not force it on anyone.  We should know better y'all.
<br>
<br>
15 years ago I would argue my butt off with people who believed in this "stuff".  I had been really well trained in the modern world, secular, linear time, "Authority's-word-is-more-valid-than-your-own-direct-experience" paradigm.  Trained to believe what I had heard rather than believing what I see.
<br>
<br>
And yet lo and behold, I ended up being a shamanic initiate and channel for spirit world.
<br>
<br>
Plant a seed, and then remain unattached to when and if it grows.....
<br>
and then at a certain point recognize that some areas are just rocky ground which will never become fertile.
<br>
<br>
But there's no need to get upset.....if you know your truth, then be patient and it will be revealed to anyone who is ready.
<br>
<br>
P.S. This is making me think of a beautiful work by Wilhelm Reich, a book called Listen, Little Man.  It's wonderful reading about the ways in which humans pathologically bow to outside authority.

Change all the references to me to the people who have replied to my point and you have my thread. If this is some sort of display of your empathy skills, I think you need to hone on them. I've remained calm and mildly amused while reading the replies to these threads, watching several love and lights have temper tantrums. Look at the way people have responded to this thread and you will see they really can't handle a different opinion. They'll write pages and pages about 'love', do you think they're responded 'lovingly' to my thread
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
No, the reason is because they are HUMAN BEINGS and this unconditional love they aspire to is unnatural. Human Beings have a variety of emotions, they aren't just cold, sterile beings who love everything no matter what, and no one should aspire to that.

 No one seems to have adressed the my argument anyway, and people have instead chosen to try and avoid my challenging of their beleif systems and to try and focus on my 'angst'. That way, you can make it look like I'm just doing this because I'm a frustrated head case, so my opinon won't matter enough for you to consider, because you know I'm making a fair point: if one of you chanelled your guides right now, that guide would refuse to do anything whatsoever that would prove it at least exists. You say that isn't important, but do you think people are really going to get into this spiritual evolution stuff if it appears that it doesn't even exist?
</blockquote>
<br>
I think one reason why no one has addressed your argument is because the original post is based completely on the premise that the whole Guide thing is Cr*p.  When I read it I saw no possible reason to wade into an argument to try and persuade you of anything.
<br>
<br>
The problem with asking other people to have their Guides prove something to you, is, the means you chose are totally unworkable from the outset.  So no Guide would even try to respond in the fashion you sought.
<br>
<br>
A solution to this for you would be to find someone who can help introduce you to your own Guidance, although I doubt you would be successful because of your already stated opposition to the whole idea.
<br>
<br>
Nothing can come to us if we make no room for it.
<br>
<br>
You asked,
<i>
 " do you think people are really going to get into this spiritual evolution stuff if it appears that it doesn't even exist?"
</i>
<br>
<br>
Many people may not get into it while some others are.  I find those who are interested in finding their own Guidance instead of asking for proof from other people's, are more able to experience direct face to face contact.
<br>
<br>
The mind-set makes a huge difference.  Success in meeting Guidance usually comes from the need, or timing being perfect for a person to make the connection.  They are usually not disappointed with their experiences then.
<br>
<br>
I only know this because most of what I do is to bring people to their primary Guide in order for the person to begin working with them and to therefore grow towards clarity without the need to seek answers from other people.
<br>
<br>
So, until you have worked through whatever it is that makes you close off to the Guidance you were born with, no one can help to prove anything like this to you.
<br>
<br>
And even if you did work it out, no one could prove it to you...  only guide you to meeting your Guides where you would then prove it to yourself.
<br>
<br>
Words do no justice..  you should experience for yourself...  then you will know.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy

Dear Aryanknight666,
<br>
<br>
Surely the only way for you to establish an answer to your question regarding guides etc. would be for you yourself to receive confirmation from them directly and indirectly via 3rd parties. This is something I have been able to verify in my own case. Sharing examples of my own experience might not be adequate demonstrable proof for you as is reasonable.
<br>
<br>
Hypothetically: Lets say you have a guide or chosen inspirer – then they would be obliged if asked by you to prove themselves in order for you to establish a clear cut answer or not etc.
<br>
<br>
For instance sometime between 10:30pm and 11:10pm this evening (GMT and regardless that in the non-physical the time equation is negated) I became aware of an individual clairvoyantly: a bald slim man with angular features and a cheeky smile or at least an image of such.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is one of your inspirer's seeking to provide you with a double take. But then I could be making all of this up!
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
<br>
<br>

<section>
Your own true guide (a poor label) will prove themselves to you as they have been waiting for this very moment to be asked. The ability to be able to connect with them is already yours and has always been available to you.
<br>
<br>
Simply sit in the quiet and send a thought that it is your sincere and heart felt wish to connect with them. As one of my teachers put 'do not expect your guide to slap you with a big wet fish'! Therefore the way in which they present to you may well be very subtle at first, but will develop character and depth over time.
<br>
<br>
A true guide will bring only love, absolute truth, and will not represent themselves as someone they are not - therefore there will be no deceit! Do not be ashamed to test them continuously. For example: if some says in your mind's eye 'trust me' do not offer trust without verification 1st.
<br>
<br>
The tests are simply to apply the qualities already stated above. If you feel uncomfortable with this then sit for self healing until you feel all bonds detrimental to your spiritual growth have been released. If you feel unable to establish a healing link then ask and it will be given for you.
<br>
<br>
Establishing trust in ones guides takes time, but they are eternally patient as is your own spirit!
<br>
<br>
Good luck,
<br>
<br>

No matter how you try to make the initial connection, make sure your Intent is there.  It took me
<u>
 forever
</u>
it seemed to get through to my higher-self, but ultimately I never
<u>
 really
</u>
tried .  It/We were always there, you know, that
<i>
 feeling
</i>
in the back of your mind you should or shouldn't do something?
<br>
<br>
Your Higher-self is you.  It's your partner.  It's the part of you that won't
<i>
 fit
</i>
into your body.  You have other guides as well, but for the sake of argument, let's stick with higher-self (it's easier to allow for than other guides without getting too mystical).
<br>
<br>
The modality you use is really up to you.  It's safe to say there ae hundreds of ways people work with their higher selves.  Not everyone has a full blown conversaion in their heads.  Some do Automatic writing (okay, typing).  A pendulum is still an acceptable way to make initial contact.  Tarrot is still useful, if you can take inspiration from the cards(it's not really the cards, it's the flashes of insight you get seeing them).
<br>
<br>
Now, my initial contact was through a simple yes/no device.
<i>
 Why
</i>
it worked was from a Reading I got that evening.  It didn't feel right, so I meditated on it.  Very deep meditation sitting at the computer.  Then I got
<i>
 inspired
</i>
, and tried
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.facade.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.facade.com
</a>
then the yes/no page.  I really don't use it anymore, but at the time it was marvelous.  It takes very little energy for your higher-self to manipualte a random number generator on a webserver.  I started with Basic questions and got very deep.  The key was I stayed focused in meditation (slip out of meditation and you can lose the energy, think of it as an energy excercise).
<br>
<br>
Since then I migrated to standard Pendulum technique.  Recently I've changed to Automatic typing when working with others.  I can, with meditation, also have a conversation in my head (it's still hard for me to do for too long, and I have other guides now).  The
<i>
 feelings
</i>
are much easier to feel now.  It's like having a backup team with me whenever I need a consultation.  When something doesn't
<i>
 feel
</i>
right i examine the feeling and can usually find what it is.
<br>
<br>
The keys are Intent and Focus.  Take any of the usual precautions you take doing energy work.  Verifying it's yoru higher-self as opposed to something else is always a question.  All I can say is I know by feel, the overwhelming feeling of LOVE when my guides are there.

aryan, I have not read this whole thread, but I have similar views on spirit guides. I went through a great deal of trouble in order to meet mine, but what I saw was I guess a kind of demon-hybrid. She was like a finely crafted sculpture coming out the igenious rock wall of volcano, where she was hibernating for God knows how many years or millenia. She was smokey blue tinted grey, blue around the edges of her blackish wings. She was the embodiment of someone who had mastered the light and the dark, independence, and beauty. For a moment, I definitely thought I had seen something close to perfection.
<br>
<br>
I made a sudden mistake. I looked at her face, peered deeply into her eyes, at first trying to commit the face to memory, but then to see the "real" her. From what I had read in astral forums, maybe this was a live person? Her face disappeared and instead I saw a blurry window of a pathetic fat lonely man in his 40s, roaring in selfishly spoiled anger. I was disturbed and frightened. Had I made contact with some gay freak from the hicks? Best not to think about it, I thought.
<br>
<br>
Since then I have not seen her, nor any other guide, and not for total lack of trying. I can only conclude that there are no guides for me, not at this time.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I offended her by looking into her? Was that an unwitting psychic attack? Was her apparition of a fat man my punishment? Was it a curse? Was I looking into a mirror, at my eventual future?
<br>
<br>
I would feel dishonest to say I that I saw a real conscious being. The experience, however, was definitely real to me, and I will always remember that small moment where I saw how far independence could take a person.

Hi Aryan,
<br>
Some great things have come from your question..  you worked through somethings..  I see the change in your tone/feel.  It's great.
<br>
<br>
Good advice has also come in the replies you received.
<br>
<br>
Can I suggest a direct method for meeting your primary guide (higher-self) ?
<br>
<br>
In my home pages under the link below you will find an easy method to prepare and experience.  Don't expect to understand what you might experience at first..  understanding will come with practice.
<br>
<br>
As with all things, we need to practice a thing for at least 30 days in order to find if it will work well for us, and to modify it for ourself.
<br>
<br>
As Rastus said,
<i>
 " The keys are Intent and Focus. Take any of the usual precautions you take doing energy work. Verifying it's your higher-self as opposed to something else is always a question. All I can say is I know by feel, the overwhelming feeling of LOVE when my guides are there."
</i>
<br>
<br>
Guides will appear to you in a way that is unique for you.  It will have some meaning to you, whether you are aware of it yet or not.
<br>
<br>
And, try not to expect or think that your experiences should be this way or that, should follow some philosophy or belief system, etc.  To expect or believe a thing about it will be the trigger to manifest it that way, so you won't see clearly enough.  My old teacher used to say,
<i>
 " Go to it as if naked."
</i>
, meaning to have no pre-conceived ideas or beliefs about how it should or should not be.
<br>
<br>
Good luck.

You made no mistake in your actions.  You were shown a probable future you.  The being appeared to you in a way that suggested your current awareness and interests, as they can.  As such it was a reflection for you, and it certainly got your attention, exactly as it was designed to do.
<br>
<br>
Try again.  Let go of the image you hold in your mind of this being and allow them to appear in another helpful guise.  Feel the energy of that being.  You will recognize it, and find it resonating inside you.  If it does not fill you with the warmth of love, then Intend to see clearly and look into them.  You will soon see what they are and know the first important thing about journeying in the realms...  Feel is the key to knowing who and what you are dealing with, and, Intent with focused attention is the key to direction and going where you want to go.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, have some fun with it..  it's not meant to be serious all the time.
<br>

aryanknight, let me define "spirit guide" to you so that you might know why some of the other members in this thread are viewing you as foolish.
<br>
<br>
A spirit guide is a teacher/adviser from the "other side." As such the demonic entities you worship/invoke/evoke fall under this category.

Hi Aryan,
<br>
In all honesty, I don't think anyone was trying purposely to belittle or defame you in any way, but I do see that some respondents were trying to point out something important to you about what it is that prevents you from experiencing connection with your Guidance.
<br>
<br>
Difference of opinion is normal in a place like this with so many people using the forum.  Some have strong reactions to what gets written, others can see through the words into the writer.
<br>
<br>
As an aside; Much information used by the church of satan has been twisted by the individuals who chartered the church.  Even they were not to know that the being represented to us historically as satan was actually the Anunnaki Enki.  And the reason he was portrayed that way was because he refused to accept the Elohim order to not inform his genetic creations of the impending cataclysm we wrongly call the biblical flood, hence ever after he was illustrated as the serpent/snake in the tree of knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the symbol he created to use in his production center was the Caduceus, which is where the snake symbolism began.
<br>
<br>
He was a good guy, and has been brought down to us by the Controllers as being the devil, satan himself.  Can you see the twist.  It was all for control.  Are you now controlled in your beliefs according to such disinformation or will you think beyond what you have been taught and find the truth for yourself ?
<br>
<br>
Good Luck on your path Aryan.

<section>
If you read many of my posts, especially from a little while ago now, you will see that I talk alot about enki etc. I know exactly what you're talking about. I used to be a part of the group which held that beleif, about Satan being enki etc.
<br>
But unfortunatley the are sadly misinformed about many facts, and do no acknowledge any Satanic philosophy (not really anyway) and are too dogmatic for my liking. I find alot of the people there are like robots and parrots to what it says on the website(s). This sort of thing is very contradictory to Satanic Philosophy.
<br>
Your mention of the COS interests me, because they don't actually beleive in Satan as a convetional being. If you read the Satanic Bible or some web content of the COS you'll get a better idea of their beleifs (if you haven't already).
<br>
<br>
But Tayesin, the problem with this annunaki stuff is that it is entirely based off the works of Zechariah Sitchin, proven to be a fraud and a liar. Scientists, archeaologists, historians and scholars (sitchin is an economist) who actually know how to read the languages sitchin claims to know, like sumerian cuniform, all discredit him. His writings are erroneous without a doubt, as are others like erich von daniken who write about similar things.
<br>
So I do not beleive in the 'annunaki' (that word I beleive, was erroneously matched to gods like enki etc) who came from the planet nibiru, or any of that stuff about Enki creating humanity. I do think that Satan could have been Enki though, seeing as Enki represented wisdom, science, medicine, intelligence, was the king of magicians, the lord of the watery abyss etc. But I beleive Satan to be a supernatural being and not an extraterrestrial giant.
<br>
I beleive in a dark or sinister presence within ourselves (the dark part of our psyche, our carnal or primitive selves) and that pretty much motivates human beings a great deal since we have the instinct to survive, we have lust etc. Think about how much these carnal things dominate our lives. I also beleive that a dark or sinister presence exists without as well, not just within our own psyches. Although I don't think that Satan is just an archetype. I beleive in him as a rea being as well but beause of the archetypal dark force he cannot be as simple as a spacially limited, physical being. The same for demons as well.
<br>
<br>
So if I am going to reach out to a spirit guide, its obviously in question whats their waiting for me, and its probably going to be very different to most people's guides here.

<section>
Hi Aryan,
<br>
I have to disagree with you about where I get my info on the Anunnaki, as I for one am not impressed with Sitchin's interpretations nor his own personal additions.
<br>
<br>
My dearest friend is a 70 year old lady who also deciphered the Sumerian Cuneiform Tablets for the British Museum during the time Sitchin was working on them.  She often had flaring arguments with Sitchin over his interpretations that were not essentially written in the texts.  For example, Sitchin claims the Anunnaki mined gold from here to suspend in the atmosphere of their homeworld, and no where in the cuneiform texts does it say this.
<br>
<br>
The reason why I still agree with the Sumerian Texts is because they have now been scientifically proven to an accuracy of about 80%.  All the detailed information about planetary mechanics, the best way to navigate through our own solar system, the descriptions of all the outer planets including their sizes, masses and up-close appearance, and the genetic informations including the disposal of un-workable creatures they buried in massive sarcophagi in the deserts (which have all been discovered and removed to the British Museum).
<br>
<br>
All that is left really, for us to discover, is the reality of the homeworld Nibiru, the physical attributes of the Anunnaki themselves and whether or not they will like us now that we have progressed as far as they had the last time they were here in numbers.  Chances are they will not like it at all !
<br>
<br>
In all honesty, I do not think Satan is a living being in it's own right.  In fact, because so many people have inadvertently believed in such a being, either through fear or worship...  they have unwittingly created such a being with their combined and lengthy thoughts on the matter.
<br>
<br>
Also, I do not believe in anything as being carnal in nature.  I see those words as being value-laden, judgments made by humans from an earlier and far more confined belief-system/time.
<br>
<br>
So what I see is this....  there is no good and evil except for what has been created within this Duality layer of creation/the universe.  So nothing of a value-judgment nature can really apply in the bigger picture of reality.
<br>
<br>
Yet at the same time I also see that each of us beings (human or otherwise) chooses what they wish to experience and express about themselves.  And since we are all existing in this Duality layer together, we all have portions of light and dark within ourselves.
<br>
<br>
To me this implies the need to search out our light and dark natures so that we may readily OWN them as our own, and then move onto clarity brought by wholeness.  At which time we will be free from the clutter of seeing only Dualities, and more able to see beyond the representations we find all around.
<br>
<br>
AND, I liked your last post Aryan...  well thought out and well said.
<br>
<br>
LOL @ your Guide probably being very different to the others here.  You'll probably find they manifest to you in a way that is both specific and meaningful to you, and only you.  How they appear is not important to any one else, only you.  And who cares what others think of how they appear to you !

That's only for spiritual satanists ie people who read the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///joyofsatan.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 joyofsatan.com
</a>
and thought this is cool I think I'll join the e-groups, + the high preists.
<br>
Personally I think a guardian demon is very different to a spiritual guide for a person who follows new age or the right hand path.
<br>
Most of the guides for these people are meant to be angels, archangels and other beings that are totally different to demonic entities.
<br>
But, the joy of satan does regard the demons to be good guys who are their to teach and guide humanity, and they regard the angels as evil people who feed off the energy of their followers and ulitmatley want to destroy humanity. So obviously what their perception of an demon is is different to how you and others would perceive a demon. Its basically how you would perceive an angel, more or less, and how they perceive angels is how you would perceive demons. They basically are what we might call 'reverse christians'. Taking everything and flipping it around. They even admit it themselves, when talking about the upside down cross as a satanic symbol they say 'this symbol represents that everything is reversed, hell is a paradise, heaven is a torture chamber, the angels are evil, the demons are good, satan is the saviour, jehova is the true devil etc'. Whilst I don't agree with any of that really I respect their path and their way of thinking and I do not wish to defame them in anyway or be of hostile approach to them. It is up to each individual to decide what they think about different people, groups and path. I am simply expressing my own personal opinion and feelings. But I do not mean to disrespect them.

With most things you are right, Aryan Knight, and things there are just reversed, but there's also a good amount of truth at this site. It's only a matter of distinguishing truth from propaganda. And a bit about angels may be true. I would think that it's just a lie, but after my brother had a vision about a "human slaughterhouse", I am nearly sure it's true. This vision explained everything with terrifying consistence.

<section>
Of course,
<br>
that site contains alot of truths. The way they go about presenting that information is not what I agree with. It's too dogmatic, almost like its trying to brainwashed its followers. In order to brainwash someone they need to be weak -- and there's a direct contradiction of satanic philosophy and what a satanist is already.
<br>
Angels submit totally to 'jehova', 'yahweh', whatever you wish to call him/it. Personally its obvious to me that 'yahweh' is a reference to the four seraphim, the higest ranking angels. 'yahweh' the word itself does not refer to a single being at all but indeed 4. I beleive lucifer was once a part of the seraphim, perhaps even the leader, but obviously is not anymore and has been replaced. Lucifer was and is a proud and beautiful being. He is proud because he is strong, feirce, confident, beautiful, intelligent, wise and ancient. He is the ancient dragon. He was a strong willed individual. The qu'ran says that when 'allah' wanted Satan to prostrate himself before adam and humans. Satan refused where as the other Angels all prostrated themselves before man. They bowed down meekly to it because it was a creation of 'god', made in the image of god --  they bowed down to it because they were and are totally dedicated to brainlesly serving and submitting to yahweh. Islam literally means 'submission', it requires that week submission and total surrender to 'allah'. Submission as a recurring theme in islam can help you understand their version of the story of Satan. That Satan refused to submit to something just because it was created in the image of 'allah', just because it was associated with him, it means that he was very proud and did not want to bow down to anything, he didn't want to lower himself weakly to something pathetically. That does not mean that he wanted humans to bow down to him, however. He wanted them to be proud, feirce and confident individuals like himself. For Angels to be so meek and submissive they would have to be quite emotionless and drone-like. That helps you to understand Angels, they are just like vessels at the command of their leader, emotionless and drone like beings. They want this sort of submission and weakness, abandonment of the individual. If they are emotionless and completely under the command of their leader, mere vessels, then they will have no problem with performing things like mass slaughter.

<br>
as a lurker, I am with mr. 666 all the way thru this thread.  His questions and tone completely mirror where my mind is on this whole spirit guide topic. Honestly, if spirit guides do exsist...not to be egotistical or anything, but I feel I should giving my guides advice, not the other way around.
