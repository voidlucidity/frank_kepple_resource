I was wondering if any of you have activated the crown chakra?  I was trying to activate my third eye &amp; ended up activating the crow chakra (first time) &amp; it was pretty darn cool!  Now, I saw a double helix (green atoms popped out of my third eye &amp; started forming a double helix) and I was wondering, did I rearrange my DNA?  I've heard very little information about this, so if anyone could tell me, what exactly happened.  Did I change my DNA?  Have any of you done this?  Please help me out, I'd like as much information as you can supply, I feel as though I did something important (but I don't know what!).  The experience remains a little hazy in my mind, because I fell into a dream shortly after.  So please, post your knowledge on the subject, as well as any experiences you may have to share.  Thanks!

nope, altering DNA requires much more work
<br>
i activated anything i could think of, including crown, still doing some
<br>
how to activate =&gt; energy flows when attention goes, all you have to do is intent to open and concentrate on the area, meditate on yourself to get exact location
<br>
this is simplest, as thus most powerful technique, you can also do some mantras
<br>
warning: any mental and emotional disorders will be amplified, also ask yourself if you are ready to interact with other planes, i know too many prsons that regret it, deal with your fear first

<br>
My Crown Chakra was opened by Old Guru Vethathiri of the Simplified Kundalini Yoga organization (S.K.Y.).  What I noticed was that after the Crown Chakra initiation was that I could feel the energy anywhere in my body -- it is the key for being able to do all the other energy work.
<br>
<br>
In Sanskrit-Yogic arcana they say that the Energy System is like a Tree, only that the Roots go upward and the trunk and the leaves go downward.
<br>
This may give us some better understanding of the Crown Chakra.  It's primary purpose may be in gathering Spiritual Nutrition, NOT in manifesting or utilizing it.  As far as Spiritual Powers go, the more useful Chakras may be the Agna Browe Chakra or the Heart and Throat Chakra.  But remember, the Tree is dead without its roots, and the Roots are the Crown Chakra.
<br>
<br>
I had one Lucid Dream in which I was reciting the first line of the "Hail Mary" (Hail Mary Full of Grace, the Lord is with Thee), and I was swoped up by a vortex presumably up into Heaven where I lost all recall.  But the next day during a nap I experienced my Crown Chakra lit up like a glowing White Light which soaked all the way down into my brains.
<br>
<br>
The Crown Chakra gathers and stored Spiritual Energy.

I don't want robbing someone something under the nose.
<br>
Just to watch some facts.
<br>
DNA is multidimensional, only two strands are physical, the others are
<br>
of etheric matter/ higher dimensional.
<br>
<br>
Changing DNA can work by gather the past life / akashah  .
<br>
resolving the karmic inprints.
<br>
DNA is the bluprint of actions, it can be manipulated by others and several parts activated by energic interaction/exchange/ with beings from *evrywhere*.
<br>
<br>
evry energy ceneter relates to its own dimension
<br>
<br>
....
<br>
<br>
for me are the most active/ used chakras : solar plexus, heart, crown,
<br>
above the head(alpha chakra). the rest is just compensated? I do some basic practice with the root &amp; deeper ones under the feet. I feel it is time to melt them down to bigger one.
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
a tree needs both the sun and the roots.
<br>
But you needn't being *alienated* to do this stuff. The lower chakras / DNA parts are developing automaticly in physical interaction.

I've activated it hundreds of times (not exagerated lol). In fact it's strange how it makes this huge pressure, but with a little mental effort one can invert it and make it an aspiration from the top. I highly suspect that there are in fact 2 chakras there, or 2 parts of a big one, the highest one being just above the actual physical crown. Nothing specific to notice anyway after those activations. It's like any other chakra, no really big deal for me (in fact it has been almost always active (pressures, energy rushs etc.) during the day with the brow centre for more than 2 years now, and nothing spectacular has happened to me

Kalonek-
<br>
do you use the crown chakra for anything?  Like, to see anything, or get information?  I use the third eye chakra regularly for the clairvoyance vision screen...but what can be done with the crown chakra?  What can you do with it?

Hi SummerBreeze,
<br>
<br>
I activate, or open up my crown chakra every time I do an energy meditation as a normal part of that meditation. There's nothing special or mystical about doing so. The crown chakra a normally functioning part of our energy body and doesn't require any special technique or set of circumstances to be opened, other than whatever meditation/energy raising practice you like to use.
<br>
<br>
There is unfortunately a lot of superstition and mystical nonsense that goes along with working with the chakras. It really is very simple, and you can ignore most of the odd things you might hear about the do's and don'ts of working with them.
<br>
<br>
As far as what it's used for goes, the crown chakra is the point with which we connect to the divine, or the universal wholeness or oneness.  Much information from the higher realms is passed to us from through this chakra, not to mention the healing power that this white universal energy brings.
<br>
<br>
During my meditations I visualise spreading roots out from the soles of my feet to provide me with grounding and to draw up the Earth's warm and powerful energy. I picture this energy as being a golden energy (other's picture it as being red, as in base chakra). I draw this energy right up through my entire body, activating each chakra in turn. When the crown chakra's been activated, I then visualise a column pure white divine light streaming down into my now open crown chakra, then that divine energy flows down through my body, mixing with the earth energy to give me a strong connection to both the grounding energies of the earth, and the healing and inspiring energies of the universe. Being connected to the two energies is not only highly energizing, it gives you significantly heightened awareness to use for astral travel, spirit communication, connecting with your higher self, etc.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
James.

Thanks for the reply James,
<br>
Yes, there is so much mixed up information out there, it's hard to know what to expect.  And since I don't remember all of it (because of falling asleep), I just wondered if it increased any dormant psychic abilities.

Thanks for the information!

I can see trough the crown, but inituition works for both (heart/crown) very good.
<br>
<br>
One time i get heart ache( I am a smoker)
<br>
I just trusted my heart, and asked it to trace me a way to a healing place. I gone for a walk and experienced
<br>
that my heart is attracted by lay lines (the most laylines
<br>
are on street as the most crossings of them are near churches, but not evry church must be a crossing of ley lines.I gone further in forest and there has been a place, where a forster made explanations to the most plants in one place.I suppose all plants are connected to the power lines of earth.
<br>
Maybe in my past life I was a plant.
<br>
As i hold on there was a plant that was used for heart medicine, too .I just crazy I've eaten some plant
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///stuff.now" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

<br>
Yeah, exactly.
<br>
<br>
It is somewhat embarrassing, after all the claims that people have made for the Crown Chakra, that you can get so much activity out of it with apparently nothing to show for it.
<br>
<br>
In an effort to defend the Crown Chakra against charges that it may be entirely useless, I can argue that the Crown Chakra roots us to the Higher Energies and fascilitates our spiritual growth... but that is just an argument and I would be hard pressed to prove it.

I guess the best thing to say here is don't worry about proving it to others, let them make up their own minds. As long as your happy that you've proven it to yourself, that's what counts. You might be happy to know though, that my own personal experiences with my crown chakra agree with what you say.

<section>
I've never really done any meditation–release-energy work. Astral projection is what I know and I stick to that. However, in the course of my AP activities I often cannot help activating all kinds of energy centres.
<br>
<br>
The one at the top of the head, which I am assuming is the Crown Chakra, gives me different sensations. I can activate it mildly just by thinking through the top of my head now as I type, and I get a tingling sensation that gets more intense the more I think about it. If I continue, the tingling will start travelling down through my body. It tingles all the way down as it does so, and gives me goose-bumps on my arms, for example. The right kind of classical music activates it too, which also gives the same tingling feeling.
<br>
<br>
The other time it comes alive is when I switch focus to non-physical. There is an initial sensation that feels like the top of my brain is being lightly stroked with a feather. This gets progressively more intense and eventually, after about 20 seconds, it becomes a light vibration. After about another 20 seconds or so, this changes into a high-pitched buzzing sensation. It feels all the time as if my actual brain was buzzing and vibrating which it isn't literally, of course. It just feels that way.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, to project with full awareness, i.e. being totally immersed within the non-physical with all your senses requires the energy centre at the crown to be active. Whereas, just to take a look requires only the one at the forehead to be active.
<br>

Dear Frank,
<br>
<br>
The real intriguing thing about the Crown Chakra is that it extends well past the top of the head... just like a Crown, as a matter of fact.
<br>
<br>
Lately I have felt the energy extending out from the sides of my head.

<section>
Leo:
<br>
<br>
I agree these sensations can be intriguing. Out of curiosity, a couple of years ago I went through a phase of activating these areas. The heart centre gives me some incredible sensations. Now and again, I'll do it just for the whacky experience. I've never really analysed the crown, but it is obvious when it becomes active as I feel definite vibrations coming from it.
<br>
<br>
The fact that it extends as you say makes perfect sense, and out through the sides too... sounds like a great sensation!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I am rather new to any kind of experiences of this sort, as well as new to a lot of things in life being that I am young. None the less, have been fascinated with almost everything I've read in these forums since I found the training guide to seeing auras by Robert Bruce. I started attempting to meditate as well as see auras about three months ago while also checking up on these posts. So many of the things mentioned in these posts are finally answering the questions I've had.
<br>
<br>
Recently I have experienced the same kind of warm tingling feeling running down my entire body when I focus on my brow center. I had been getting that earlier but attributed it to being cold or something else after feeling my arms and legs develop goose bumps.  After researching more today in the forums, I saw a few other posts on the loud roaring sound that can be created with some kind of muscle in the center of my head. I have had that ability for a long time and always wondered what it had been used for. I also have been noticing the light ringing in my ears and have tried to focus. After a while the ringing becomes louder and then undertones start to develop. They seem to undulate and pulse with each one that I listen to.
<br>
<br>
Although I have not been able to have a complete OOBE, I have been trying recently to focus on the auras and fast moving energy flows in the air I've started seeing as well as my aura triangle, and my other centers. I was curious as to What ways can I try to use the roaring sound in developing my senses as well as how to enhance my chakras and auratic hearing and vision to help me improve. Another question I have looked for but not really found was if it is believed that every person has a main and other guides helping, and will meditation and other trainings allow me to push further in directly reaching my guide?

About the Sound that you can meditate on.... here is a Site for the Surat Shabd Yoga People, who are the experts on this particular (

)  They recommend that you meditate only on the Sounds coming from the Right Side, and never the left.
<br>
<br>
I'm always glad to hear from anybody who can do that Flex Trick in the head to make the Roar Noise.  As far as I can tell the Roar Thing sort of generates up the Energy.... that if you head did not already have a large store of energy, then doing the Roar Reflex would get up a whole bunch of Energy in only seconds.  Mr. Rocketman007 had said he had remembered to do the Roaring Thing during Lucid Dreaming, for good effect, but I keep forgetting to do it.
<br>
<br>
As for Guides and Spiritual Patronage... do you remember your dreams?  Have you met any Old Gurus or Oracular Goddesses in your Dreams?  If you think you have no Spiritual Patronage, then you need to apply for it, I would think.  Set aside a few moments in your Meditations to ask that a message be taken to the Highest Beings of Light telling them that you wish to apply for Sponsorship.
<br>
<br>
After years of following mostly Eastern Paths, I finally became Catholic, seeing that all of the continuous Apparitions of the Virgin Mary provide the World with a connection to Heaven.  The Goddesses of all past Traditions now revolve in Her.  Becoming Catholic also avails you to the intercession of quite a few Saints of that Tradition.  However, Catholicism has no monopoly on Saints -- there are Sufi Saints and Saints of the various Sanskrit (Hindu Buddhist) Traditions.  I was conscious of Spiritual Patronage years before I ever became Catholic.

I appreciate your reply and help. I've asked a few times during meditation for any of my guides to help me learn and contact me, but I will take your advice tonight and tomorrow and ask for sponsorship.
<br>
<br>
I've always wanted to try hypnosis to possibly awaken more than I have already, but unfortunately know no one that I would be able to ask to help. Although I imagine through training I may be able to do just the same without the need to be hypnotized.
<br>
<br>
In my dreams I rarely see anyone that I do not know, although I have come in contact with a dead relative in a revitalizing dream with him glowing and hugging me years after he passed. Earlier I had asked to know who my guides were and received the names Peter and Lesley in my sleep. I still doubt if those names were given to me or just a good trick from my imagination.
<br>
<br>
I have become more Christian than other beliefs, although they intrigue me.  I was not truly raised into any religion, but have found guidance in Edgar Kayce readings as well as other various events that have pointed to similar findings as were found in Kayce's advice and profitations. I imagine I would stick to a more Christian based Sponsorship due to familiarity and reasoning, but within Christianity I have no specific denomination.
<br>
<br>
I am off tonight to try out the Shabd Yoga People's guide (any reason why they say to focus on the right ear's aura sounds only?).
<br>

 Thanks again for your help Leo.

<br>
As i am a musician, slightly, i used this and i know some background on this.
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Sounds are preceived clearlier from sides, then from the center.
<br>
2. buddhi or some people believe that from left sides sound sources are comming negative energies.&gt;following that from right side positive.
<br>
i don't believe that, it just the spectral  (from the view of the brain)
<br>
As right sound sources are transmitted to left side of the brain, which side is the logic ,rational one, which often moves to *right* results
<br>
This pushes the right side of the brain in the dark, as this side
<br>
is the emotional,irrational, intuitive side,following in the reality it is very
<br>
dangerous for people  if this side dominates the other, as from this side comes aggesivity.But this side is also important for the feeling *right* results.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Male brains are splitted more up in left/right while female brains are more
<br>
connected whith each other.
<br>
<br>
However male brains intelligence can be boosted, by synchronisation of both brain hemispheres.
<br>
<br>
3.Tone C relates to the crown e.c., like mantra  AUM does lol..
<br>
<br>
4.Sounds can be transformed to light, as light can be transformed to sound.
<br>
<br>
5.Toughts are travelling with the speed of light, while sounds are travelling
<br>
slowly.

 I've always wanted to try hypnosis to possibly awaken more than I have already, but unfortunately know no one that I would be able to ask to help. Although I imagine through training I may be able to do just the same without the need to be hypnotized.
 <br>
 <br>
 In my dreams I rarely see anyone that I do not know, although I have come in contact with a dead relative in a revitalizing dream with him glowing and hugging me years after he passed. Earlier I had asked to know who my guides were and received the names Peter and Lesley in my sleep. I still doubt if those names were given to me or just a good trick from my imagination.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have become more Christian than other beliefs, although they intrigue me.  I was not truly raised into any religion, but have found guidance in Edgar Kayce readings as well as other various events that have pointed to similar findings as were found in Kayce's advice and profitations. I imagine I would stick to a more Christian based Sponsorship due to familiarity and reasoning, but within Christianity I have no specific denomination.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am off tonight to try out the Shabd Yoga People's guide (any reason why they say to focus on the right ear's aura sounds only?).
 <br>
 <br>

  Thanks again for your help Leo.

You don't really need anybody to help you with hypnotism.  You can make casset tapes whereby you can hypnotize yourself.  I could never quite make up my mind whether to talk to myself in the first or third person, but I suppose I decided upon the third person -- use 'you' instead of 'I' when giving yourself hypnotic suggestions on tape.  They are hard to find but you can find cassette players that will loop and play all night... but they don't last long... constant play wears the things out fast.
<br>
<br>
But you can also try getting a digital watch with a countdown timer.  Set it for every 20 minutes.  Whenever it goes off, go over in your mind what your suggestion list is.  That kind of repetition will get into your subconscious.
<br>
<br>
This is why Lucid Dreaming is so important.  If you can remember a Lucid Dream Checklist, and can finally trigger a Lucid Dream, then you will be right there with a direct feed into your Subconscious Mind.
<br>
<br>
Regarding Christian Traditions... if you are comfortable with Prayer, then don't be surprised if during your ordinary Dreanms you find yourself in the Cave of Prayer precided over by the Prophet Elijah.  The Guy is very helpful.  You don't need to ask him advice.  He always seems to have plenty of advice without haviang to be asked.
<br>
<br>
Oh, and in your dreams... it is not so important that you be able to interpret them, but that you act well in them and respond correctly to the situations and choices presented.  Dreams are Spiritual Tests.  If you think you behaved badly in a Dream, then ask for a Re-Test, a Do-Over.  You need to get these things Right.   Once in a Dream I was told I was to be body guard to the Young King.  The King was Other-Worldly Crazy and Inspiring all at the same time.  He had no fear.  The Crowd outside his palace was rioting and he went out to address them.  I knew it was dangerous, but the Young King was beyond reason or concern.  So when arrows flew up, I stepped in front of the King.  It was my duty.  It turned out I passed the Test and after that time I was told I would have Angels assigned to me.   So remember, promotions in the Spiritual World require that you pass the tests.  So don't accept dreams turned sour.  Responding correctly in your Dreams recreates your Character along acceptable lines.  Your dreams don't need to be Lucid.  You only need to reflect upon your dream actions during the day and resolve with your focused will power to do better next time.

In order for me to have used the triangle method to feel disoriented, I had to focus on the full sound. Although listening I could tell noticeable differences in the right ear specifically than both. This is very interesting, thank you for your insight.

Majority of my dreams seem to be lucid in a way that I do make majority of the decisions; unfortunately, not lucid enough to fly (all the time) or be able to alter my situation other than my actions. Hopefully I can work on remembering them more vividly. After a psychology class I had I was vividly remembering 2 or 3 a night, but unfortunately I think I need to start getting more sleep and asking myself to remember them again (not too difficult a task).
<br>
<br>
Last night during meditation, I tried harder to push on the muscle controlling the roaring sound as well as focusing on my right ear.  After creating the roaring sound for just a few seconds I noticed a huge surge of energy flow down my body numerous times while focusing on my crown chakra. Thanks for the advice.
<br>
<br>
I noticed a few things in my right ear as well that seemed to be different than my left. The undertone was very different, and I wasn't sure exactly which part of the sound I was supposed to listen for, so I focused on all that I heard individually for a while.
<br>
<br>
The great news I had for myself is after listening, and focusing on those senses, my body was very relaxed. I think, if anything, it was the first step to having an OOBE. Although I didn't see myself lift or even get very far out, I definitely felt the feeling of leaving my hands and legs after my head felt disoriented. I will try again today and tonight.
<br>
<br>
Both suggestions for hypnosis sound good for me. I could also do a little digital recording and looping that may last a little longer on CD than on tape. What are some examples of hypnotic suggestions that you have tried? I think I may try the digital watch technique tonight if I can think of what exactly I want to suggest myself to do.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully after asking enough and being able to remember my dreams or make the right choices in them, I will be able to get where I need.
<br>
<br>
Another silly question is, are there any foods that you think inhibit someone's spiritual understanding or that help? Many psychics that I have heard readings from say that they can see the difference in a vegetarian's energy as apposed to someone who eats a large amount of meat.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for all your answers, I really appreciate your help.

there is no difference between eating and not eating meat, provided that you have all vitamins etc, meat has specific chi that you could need (not neccessarily, depends on what you are doing), you should also cleanse and empower your food for better results
<br>
eating before projecting makes it harder, but i'm not really into it, prefer to scan with 3 eye, saves energy

No, really...

<br>
I would suggest that "you are dreaming" and then I would give elements from your Lucid Dream Checklist, ie. what mantras you wanted to try, or what astral gate you wanted to fly into.

They always say that........ but.
<br>
<br>
At one time I was socializing entirely with Vegetarians, while I still had to deal with many other acquaintenances in Business.  Yes, the Vegetarian people were superficially more 'Spiritual', but they were also often really cranky and sickly.  As the years would go by I would notice a greater instance of hospitalization in my Vegetarian friends.  Their bodies were falling apart.
<br>
<br>
Yet one of my favorite Saints, Saint Francis of Paola, was the Founder of the Minim Order -- the strictest of Vegetarians -- not only no meat or fish, but also no dairy or eggs.  Three Popes would not certify his Order because, even in context of the harsh ascetic standards then in vogue, they thought the diet to rigerous.  Francis would always argue that 'naturally' it would be too rigorous; however, he would demonstrate a few Miracles and make the implication that health would be maintained by the same Supernatural Means that allowed for the Miracles which were so easy for him to perform.
<br>
<br>
So, regarding strict Vegetarianism... if you are sure your health will be maintained by some Supernatural Power, then go for it.  But otherwise, feed your body what it needs to survive.
<br>
<br>
In my own personal experience, I have not noticed a very great increase in Spirituality when I was more strict in my own vegetarianism.  But, now, even after disregarding a strict and guarded Vegetarism, I don't eat a great deal of meat.
<br>
<br>
Also, some traditions advocate eating meat.  The Siks in their Spiritual Disciples talk about the "5 F's" -- five things that in their language begin with the letter 'f' that are very conducive to Spirituality.  2 of the things are Meat and Fish.
<br>
<br>
I can be cynical and say that some people are helped by vegetarianism and even by strict fasting because, in the course of their self-induced malnutrition, they become more easily psychotic and delusional.  Also, by killing yourself, you can induce a Near Death Experience... but is it worth it?
<br>
<br>
I counsel patience.  A healthy person will have the Dreams and Visions that his Spiritual Sponsors regard as necessary.   Use Will Power and concentrate on wanting it all very much, but don't mess unnecessarily with your health.

With 3 eye you  just mean RV, =  less afford need , but less sensation also.
<br>
I agree RP is much harder,cause the stomach needs a lot of work,
<br>
let you literaly 'IN'.
<br>
RV works good even with full stomach. ( I prever RV, i can travel/tune faster ...)

remote presence is different from projecting, in remote presence you just move your mental body,  not that different from RV, and "easier" to achieve than creating  your astral double

yes, from RV you need not move,not  make a carbon copy-(less energy?) is needed..)  with it you can't feel anything, just seeing..
<br>
but i think it depends on how deep the trance state is.

precognition... i don't such advanced as you, i have it rarely  on the physical.(i never tought of using it in RV , lol i just think about, what could happen)(it is ratter a gift, not an usefull tool).and i'm a newbe in fighting with demons etc ( i don't need it really)..,,,.but i've got fellows, who do it.(cause of fun), but telephaty works well, if i want it.i talk a lot on astral or other planes

heh, i really don't know how i do it, but it works, didn't have to use it as of late, i have different methods now, fighting entities is no fun, rather tiresome, well, the price of choosing evolution
<br>
funny that i don't have it in the physical, maybe the times when i had it were in my mind, it has been quite a long time from.. hmm, or maybe mental body is just not limited by physical
<br>
telepathy is great, saves a lot of time, but i don't have anyone down here to train it in both ways, i just read people for exercise, hmm, empathy too, they are not that different really

the most driving energy of mental is the surviving, the mental body literaly jumps of you, if it smells death lol
<br>
Precogition is a linKING park.
<br>
Fighting on the mental level is more useful, as on physical (healing/balance?).However people are on physical for work and not for fight arround.They just begin to fight, if they want to own something, as they recognize that this own fullfil their life, makes them whole, literaly HEALING or DEATH(Like mental does for surviving).In the end of all - the mental is affecting the physical, until it is DEATH.

I don't save my time so much I'm asleep.
