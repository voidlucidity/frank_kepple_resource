<section>
I had a dream the other night that I was asleep in my dream and I dreamed.  I remembered some of the dream and I remembered part of the dream inside the dream.  When I woke up inside my dream, what I had dreamed came true (like a precog) but in my dream.
<br>
<br>
I dreamed in my dream that there were little pink notes with writing on them all over my house and then I woke up inside my dream my house was covered with them.  Also something to do with my child which was in the dream and happened when I woke up inside it.
<br>
<br>
Also while in my dream, I dreamed of having a little pet Lizard and I would pet him with my finger tip and he would close his eyes and absolute pleasure and comfort.  And when I put him down he wouldnt run away.

I had great affection for this little lizard.
<br>
<br>
I also dreamed that I was naked and wanted to pretend I was knocked out so I could see how my son would respond to that.  Would he try to revive me, steal from me, etc.
<br>
<br>
Thats about all of my dream I remember.  I just thought it was neat I dreamed inside my dream.  When I was in my teens and early 20's I could lucid dream and that doesnt happen very often for me anymore.

Ps. Is there any significance to dreaming in a dream?

I see this as awareness of various levels. It's significant if your interested in learning about dreams. Some people seem less interested in the how dreams work, but are more interested in self improvement (in waking life).

You didn't ask for a comment about this, but I have a remark anyway.

<br>
Why the need to test? In waking life (and remembered dreams) I have never felt the need to test or play games with others. Yet...I find some people around me who do this to me. I seem to pass their tests, but why the scrutiny? It just strikes me as an insecurity of some sort. Any thoughts?

I'm not sure where you are at in terms of development, but dreaming dreams within dreams, i.e. layered dreams, are generally indicative of an awakening of the awareness of self, or the awareness of the multi-faceted nature of consciousness. I sense your inner self (subjective self) is giving you a strong reminder of something, giving you a wakeup call. Perhaps it is to stimulate your curiosity in such a way as to cause you to look (mentally) in a particular direction and open up awareness of a part of yourself. The question of trust features prominently too, in that you must trust this part of yourself, or this new path you find yourself on,
<i>
 unconditionally
</i>
. The precognitive aspect is particularly significant is it would imply some kind of reward for adopting this new approach.

I too have had dreams inside dreams. Once, I even had a dream inside a dream inside a dream inside a dream.  (in one of these dreams, I even explained to some people I know  that I dreamt a dream inside a dream)
<br>
<br>
These dreams were very real, just as real as the reality I am currently experiencing.
<br>
<br>
To me, it was most of all a reminder, that this is just
<u>
 a
</u>
reality, not the ultimate reality. There is no need to take it all too seriously, after all, there are other dreams to dream. And perhaps, it is time for me to finally wake up from this dream (what is commonly referred to as reality).
<br>
<br>
This probably does not make sense to a lot of people, but then, that's not what counts.

When I first heard the term layered dreams I was tempted at first to get a definition of such a thing. Instead I decided to hold off and discover what a layered dream is through my own dreams. This is a dream I received:
<br>
<br>
In the dream I was driving three cars at once, down a road.The cars were driving as in a procession. I experienced being each person in all the cars. I was the driver, the front seat passenger, and someone in the back seat. The destination was a house on a hill side. The house was blurred as if something in the future. There was only one parking place in front of the house. The parking was parallel (It's recommended to record dreams in the present tense, but that's another subject).I was in the car which had the one space open,although somewhat aware that all three cars were the same or merged before arrival to the parking place. There was another (forth) car already parked,it was an early model car with tailfins.This seem to date the dream(?), I noticed this as the passenger and the driver at the same time.I also noticed that the corner tail of this other car was going to have to be clipped or hit for the car I was in to be able to maneuver into this only space to park(not sure what this means).I knew it was a dream so decided it didn't matter and pulled the car into the space without any difficulty or damage.
<br>
<br>
The dream ended when I awoke to the doorbell ringing. At the door was my ex,his girlfriend and my daughter standing there. My daughter was being returned from a visitation.
<br>
<br>
I think I was connecting with all three of them while they were coming to my house.The foggy or blurry house in the dream changed meaning from what I was thinking while in the dream.The meaning of this, I don't know?The door bell is also significant. I think different sounds (bells, rings, etc.) indicate various levels or planes of connection.
<br>
<br>

Frank,
<br>
Your views and writing is very interesting and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///inspiring.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 inspiring.You
</a>
have the ability to express yourself with such clarity! Although in normal life I can explain and
<br>
instruct about things well, on the subject of dreams and such, I really struggle finding the right words.I appreciate your gift and contribution. I feel like I'm learning a lot from your writings (including in the other sections). In fact, I'm drawn to this forum because I enjoy the good writing of many here.
<br>
<br>
cinnabardk,
<br>
Many times I feel I'm only as good as my last dream. Then there are those dreams that I have had, have an ongoing significance.  Even if I don't recall a dream I still feel the influence. This makes me think dreams are serious. It doesn't mean that waking life has to be serious, just the opposite possibly. It's about finding a balance,keeping things in prospective, and more,and.... in my opinion, enjoying the journey.
