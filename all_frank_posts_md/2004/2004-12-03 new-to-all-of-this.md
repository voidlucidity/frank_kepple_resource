Welcome to the forums Tool!
<br>
<br>
I also found out about the occult the same way that you probably have (Im assuming you're a big Tool fan by the name).
<br>
<br>
Generally, you will find that everyone has a different interpretation of what an OBE (out of body experience) really is, and you can only really understand it yourself by creating or perceiving your own definition of what it really is.
<br>
<br>
To me, an OBE isnt where you leave your body, but where you shift your consciousness to another plane, wavelength, vibration, etc.
<br>
<br>
There are many ways to have an OBE, do a quick search or just browse around on the forums for a bit and you'll find lots of methods.
<br>
<br>
Though if you're just starting, I highly reccomend that you begin meditating frequently (atleast half an hour per day), as meditation is absolutely necessary to inducing OBEs.
<br>
<br>
Good luck!

Can't say I know who Tool is, but I can still help you some I think, lol.

A simple way to broaden your knowledge base of all of this would be to read the books by Robert Bruce, founder of this wonderful site. Almost everything you could want to know is on here somewhere. You just might have to search for it a bit though. Feel free to ask any questions you have though. Thats what message boards are for. =)

Jeepers... take some time to look around.  This Site has opened up space for many interests.  For instance, if you are interested in Lucid Dreaming, or even ordinary Dreaming, Psychic Phenomena, Religion and Metaphysics, it seems as though a great spectrum of experts have decided to call This Page their Home.  Why?  The Traffic is Good.  On many of the other specialty Pages, the postings were so few and far between, that they virtually died out of boredom.
<br>
<br>
Also, on this page, you will certainly have your questions answered, often by several experts and from more than one perspective.  And then there will be numerous comments by active and interested practicianers... and all within several days.
<br>
<br>
I've often wondered what it is about this Site in particular that attracted so many kindred, and even non-kindred spirits -- we all do not speak with one voice.  Many of the other Specialty Sites were obvious promotion zones for books and gimmicky New Age Products.  But on this Site, Robert Bruce, our Host, makes no effort to sell anything, and nobody is pressed to toe the Party Line.  But everyone is made to feel most welcome.  It seems a simple Formula for Success, but apparently Bob Bruce was the only one of many to discern it and to put it in execution along with the rise of On Line Forums.  As the Generals say, Mr. Bruce was "there firstest with the mostest".

Hi Leo
<br>
<br>
As I seem to recall, Robert Bruce was publishing his ideas about OBE on the internet in detail for some time absolutely free, long before he published
<i>
 Astral Dynamics
</i>
.  I think this gives a lot of weight to his opinions.  This site appears to be an extension of this same original philosophy, ie that of making this valuable knowledge available freely to as wide an audience as possible.  Enjoy....

Yes.  Robert Bruce can be contrasted to the Guru of the Lucid Dreaming Empire, Stephen LeBerge.  LeBerge had a Website, but he used it as a blatant marketing tool and thereby chased everybody away -- it is now a virtual Ghost Town of Websites where posts go months without being answered.  It is not surprising, then, that all of the Lucid Dreaming People would rather hang out at a nominally OBE Website.
<br>
<br>
It is such a better Website, here, that all of the differences between OBE and Lucid Dreaming are considered 'close enough'.

I would suggest you make good use of the Search facilty for a week or two, just to bring you up to speed on the basics. Also, take a look through the Book Review section.
