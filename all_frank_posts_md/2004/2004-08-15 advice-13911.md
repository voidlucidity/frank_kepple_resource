Hello
<br>
My name is James Adamik, I am a long time energy practitioner and recent student of OBE/AP. About 6 months ago I got a copy of Astral Dynamics as a gift, i have read through it but still have some questions pertaining to some experiences in my life.
<br>
<br>
ok, heres the scenario.... for the past 3 yrs i have almost evey night drifted into a frightful dream... about 1/2 through the dream it becomes lucid as i realize it is a dream. i begin to contiously controll different aspects of it.
<br>
<br>
Soon after i become conscious and begin to controll it i "wake up" but not wake up. i cant move my body, it as if it is frozen stiff waying a million pounds, my eyes are closed yet i can see everything in the room as clear as a do moments latter when i wake for real.
<br>
<br>
I feel as if i am not laying on the bed but slightly above it..... then the terror begins. i use the word terror instead of fear becasue it is far beyond any feeling the word fear could possibly convey. every night when this happens i think "ok this is my projected double and i am almost out of my body, or maybe i already am, there is nothing to fear" but the terror persists..... it grows uintill there is nothing but dread and i cant seem to reenter my body normal, or get away from it to project... i am stuck facing the cealing screaming mental in terror. I fight with all of my might to make my hands move to hit my wifes leg to get her to wake me up but all i can ever get is a slight wiggle.
<br>
<br>
According to my wife, about this time i let out an almost imperceptable wimper and begin to shake like im going into slight seizures... she touches/shakes me and i wake up. The feelings of terror stick with me for some 30 minutes afterwords, but nothing else out of the normal occurs to my body upon waking.
<br>
<br>
when i told this to my friend he gave me a copy of astral dynamics and my reaserch has lead me here to ask for help... can someone please tell me what might be going on and how i can stop it.
<br>
<br>
oH and i also have a preaty strong fear that if i do manage to leave my body i wont be able to reenter it, as if i wont know how when i get there.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for anything you can offer
<br>
James Adamik

Welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
Most of us have gone through this stage you have described at some time or another. Yet even though I had thought I had overcome this some time ago I actually had an episode occur about 2 months ago. Although this was more a sense of dread after waking, and luckily I realised what it was, allowed myself a little time to gather my wits and after a warm drink eventually settled.
<br>
<br>
So I can respect it really can feel very frightening. As you know there is really nothing to fear, but fear itself, and although that is easy to say in practice it appears another thing altogether!
<br>
<br>
I notice that you have a copy of Astral Dynamics... please reread chapter 6 Walking Paralysis – as most of the answers you are looking for are within it! In addition I suspect from what you are saying is that you simply are not getting enough sleep as well! Consider going to bed a little earlier and if not already started try practicing some energy rising work for example New Energy Ways (NEW) as per the book. Be assured things will settle for you, but perhaps change a few patterns if at all posible.
<br>
<br>
If it is any consolation – as a child I used to suffer from really bad night terrors, but eventually found that that I was able to develop lucidity in those formative dreams. Try programming yourself in advance with a positive affirmations or short prayers of your own choice, and you should find that when you realise you are becoming lucid within your dreams that you will be able to exercise more control and overcome the issues at hand. If thing simply got too heavy I even had one I could used to enable myself to wake up! There are plenty of examples on the forum of more formal techniques in developing lucidity etc.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully your experiences will become not only enjoyable, but something that will add value to your life as welcome and joyful experiences.
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
<br>

What you describe is so very normal. Yep, you wake up thinking you are in the physical but you're not; when you try to move it feels like your body weighs heavy and you feel like you're floating just above the bed; your eyes are closed yet you can see all around you in the room: everything very normal thus far. But your protective sense of awareness won't think so. It usually shifts into overdrive and starts screaming and kicking trying to get the person out of it.
<br>
<br>
Difficulty being the fear side of things is a stage many people have to overcome before they can project with a degree of proficiency. The sheer levels of terror you speak off I, and very many others, know only too well. But you get over it in time.
<br>
<br>
The fear about leaving your body and not being able to get back in, is pretty much universal among people. The other biggie, is the fear some demon or other may in some way take over your body while you are away. All very ludicrous and laughable when chatting about it from the relative safety of the physical, but
<u>
 at the time
</u>
the experience can be monstrous.
<br>
<br>
Laughter is how I always get over it. If ever I get myself in a sticky situation and have to abort to physical, which still does happen to me now and again, I make a point of laughing at myself for a whole day for being so dumb. (Not that I'm calling anyone dumb. That's just me and the way I talk to myself.)
<br>
<br>
I note also you say for the past 3 years you have drifted into a frightful dream almost every night. May I suggest you could well have a separate problem here which should perhaps be addressed beforehand. Reason being you are attempting to enter an environment where thought-equals-action. So you don't want to be in a mindset where you are releasing any kind of fear or fright. Because all that negativity will literally become manifest all around you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
