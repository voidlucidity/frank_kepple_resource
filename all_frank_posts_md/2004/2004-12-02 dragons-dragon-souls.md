ok, to cut it short,  i and my friend did reading on each other through messanger, she has vision and i "know" and see "essential meaning"
<br>
at one point she spotted dragon near me, more or less like reptil.jpg from this site

<br>
then another, more dinosaur like dragon came out from her and they started to fight, it took some time, then they smelled !!! each other and returned into us
<br>
i was dead sure that it was reptilian so i tried to remove it straight away (perspective of being anyone's dinner is irritating to say at least), but my soul "plugged off the kether",  so i couldn't interfere, later downloaded some knowledge through crown so i know it is integral part of me, he is part of my soul (another tool, just as me), but the rest is hazy, as usual with cracking into 3d
<br>

Hmm interesting, you seem to maybe be a dragon reborn, though you say that yours was human looking, this is strange as dragons that take on human forms don't look this way, they would look like you or me.  From the pic that you said it looks like, this is beleiving me that it is more likely those reptilian aliens that people were talking about having communicated with, though I wouldn't say for sure.  I would say that maybe it would be best to meditate and communicate more with this asspect of yourself to find out more.
<br>
<br>
Funny that you bring this up though, I have a friend who was almost killed when young, but a dragon saved him and is now basicly a part of him.

<section>
if it would be reptilian then the other dragon would have destroyed it, they are enemies, and secondly my soul would assist me in removing it, i killed them before
<br>
<br>
also it wasn't human sized and had "really" long tail and mouth, notice the disproportions of the picture, but i don't really know, i have to get more accurate description from my friend, she was simultanously attacked when the dragons were fighting, but i repelled the attack (and the intruder has some surprise from me in his pattern
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
), so we were both confused and it was late at night
<br>
<br>
i meditated about it and discovered my specific soul's purpose (or rather background of it) after a  "really" long talk with my soul
<br>
the dragon is another part of my soul, still not embodied, as i ascend my form will be able to hold it
<br>
still i need some accurate info on dragons

How do you fight this sort of creatures...I mean if something attacks you how do you fight it?
<br>
Also what is the difference between a creature like this attacking someone who can see them and someone who can't?...
<br>
I'm curious as to how this works...I can't see spirits but if they attack me I don't know of it.

<section>
well, everyone has his style of fighting, i get to the core and alter it (now, i cannot describe how i do it, it wouldn't mean anything to you)
<br>
if you can't see them at least feel them, as with NEW only outside
<br>
difference ?
<br>
hmm, fist flying into your face from front, and from behind
<br>
<br>
at the beginning you can use shields
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.psipog.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
, also energy drain
<br>
as for fighting, use your imagination and energy, or rather use your energy to power up your imagination, it's hit-or-miss at the beginning, some work, some are stupid and work, and some are stupid and don't work
<br>
<br>
that dragon was another part of me that i cut off from, we are one now

Ditto to what SpectralDragon said.
<br>
<br>
Among the members of my meditation/psychic circle alone, three of us have dragons about us, most of which are protectors or guardians, one of which is a guide.
<br>
<br>
I have two around me - a green dragon that looks out for my physical protection, my material posessions and those people closest to me, and a silver/white dragon that has been my "guardian angel" since my first spiritual/psychic awakening when I was 14. The latter usually appears to me in human form, though I've watched him change from one form to the other.
<br>
<br>
My closest friend has a blue dragon that keeps watch over her house. He usually gets comfortable in one corner of our meditation room when we gather, and is happy to stay among us as he says he find us amusing.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
My friend also has a white dragon that comes usually in the form of a human female. She has an increadible presence, and a beautiful rich voice. I'm not entirely sure of her purpose, she is part protector and part guide to my friend, and she has given me some guidance on occasions as well.
<br>
<br>
Another member of our circle has a red dragon that appears around him from time to time. As he is closely connected to the element of fire, he tends to have a bit of the dragon energies in him.
<br>
<br>
Well, that accounts for the dragons that I am personally familiar with, and have been in contact with. What I've learned about these utterly wonderful beings is that firstly they are very very good protectors, no lesser spirit or being will dare tangle with a dragon, and they are also very wise, knowledgeable and caring guides.
<br>
<br>
It is not unreasonable to believe a person could have the soul of a dragon. Once I would have said this is not possible, that it would be just as unlikely as an angel incarnating as a human. I have recently come to learn though that the latter does indeed happen. Angels do incarnate here on earth, typically to become lightworkers for some specific purpose. It is just as reasonable to assume that dragons incarnate here on earth, I guess to become guardians of some sort.
<br>
<br>
You will likely find more relevant information on dragons in a library or metaphysical bookstore. Unfortunately the web is more aligned with the  RPG aspects.
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

you should Find your pheonix Guide. The Pheonix guards the dragon. Also, you likely have a particular "tie" with Arc Angel Micheal.

I don't mind if you think you are a dragon or not,  it just seems very strange to me.  I suppose I need to see a dragon first in order to start trying to wrap my mind around being one.  How do you know it isn't you just having a fascination for dragons?  I think they're cool mystical beast but that is about as far as it goes with me.

<section>
there was no defense, just reminder
<br>
you have this feeling of truth, resonating deep within your soul, and all of your being, when every cell of your body screams yes, this is it, now it makes sense !?
<br>
i have been fascinated by dragons as a child, from 2 to 7 years, but i forgot about that, i wrote that i have been reminded
<br>
later it stopped, an interest to draw them sparkled about 2 years ago, and was forgotten
<br>
up to that ... meeting, when i heard her describing it, and i wasn't sensing anything discordant besides some petty intruder that jumped to the occasion when they were fighting, i thought that i am dog food for reptilians, who are just better than me
<br>
i don't see, i feel, to the core of anything i focus on
<br>
my mind took over, and tried to do what i always did when something succesfully penetrated my field, drive it out, it was pure instinct, rage in it
<br>
there wasn't anything that wasn't me, i couldn't find anything in dissonance, then i jumped to the written description, her memory, and linked to him, and tried to cut him off, and my soul interrupted, it never happened before, i was in shock and calmed down ...
<br>
then, piece after piece, with guidance to various articles on the net, i understood, later i understood more, and more, and suddenly, pieces fit, flash of light, and i knew why i am here

I am not sure what kind of soul I really have, it isn't important anyway. But I am sure it's something extraordinary, because I have very strange birthmark on my right arm. It is nearly impossible for a birthmark to be so complex, and precise, it looks nearly like tattoo, and I have feeling that it is something important. It is depicting a fish. I've always been fascinated for dragons, snakes, etc. in my whole life, and someway I don't feel right in this body. There are also many other things, but there's no need to convince anyone.

<section>
While I consider it true that a soul is a soul is a soul, that is, we are all souls that are a piece of God/The Creator/The Universal Consciousness, I do believe that there are some souls on the high end of the evolutionary wheel that have sought particular experiences by performing particular tasks. I'd put beings such as angels, dragons &amp; fairies into this category.
<br>
<br>
I first read about the idea of such beings incarnating into human form when reading a couple of books by Dr Doreen Virtue, to whom it was revealed by angels that they can and do incarnate into physical bodies here on earth to perform very specific and important tasks. After reading her thought on the subject, I wanted to check this out for myself. I used what spirit vision abilities I had and started taking notice of the features and energies given off by people around me.
<br>
<br>
One of the things I am able to do is look at someone, and see a spirit "aspect" of that person, which is like looking at a spirit image overlayed on their physical appearance. Though this ability is limited, I have been able to clearly see a few people who appeared to me as obviously being incarnated nature spirits, and a couple of incarnated angels. Incarnated angels tend to have really stunningly beautiful "spirit faces", have strong areas of gold in their auras, and tend to be healers or people that you generally feel very comfortable being around. Physical appearances also can often tell something of the type of soul that has incarnated into a person.
<br>
<br>
Well, these are my observations, which confirm for me what I've read from someone I consider to be a reputable author. Don't take my word for it though. If anyone else has the ability to see auras and the spirit aspects of people, take a look sometime at people around you and see what you can see.
<br>
<br>
So, though I've not yet seen anyone who I could say for sure has a dragon's soul, as I've seen evidence of other "special" souls incarnate in people, I don't doubt it happens. I wonder if someone that has a dragon soul would tend to make people feel safe when their around them?
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

 So, though I've not yet seen anyone who I could say for sure has a dragon's soul, as I've seen evidence of other "special" souls incarnate in people, I don't doubt it happens. I wonder if someone that has a dragon soul would tend to make people feel safe when their around them?

With myself, it's often one extreme or the other. People either feel so comfortable around me they will confide anything, or they feel so discomforted they will attack with no reason. A dragon often puts fear (usually not much at all in my case I believe, but the effect is still evident,) into those who go against it's ideals, even on an unconscious level. For people who are friends, relatives, ect, the opposite is true. When I find a new friend I am loyal "to a fualt," as I have heard it described. I don't necissarily agree with that but since I can't see myself from a viewpoint that is not critical one way or the other I will go with what other individuals say.
<br>
<br>
Nay: I do not believe that humans are simply humans: we are so much more than that. Each incarnation we might become either a human, a dolphine, a tree, a guide, or even incarnate on another universe. The essence behind "dragon's" is that they are guardians.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps, one day, we shal meet on astral pulse island. At that time I might fly over the ocean for you. I know you don't believe in my powers but in any case it would allow you to see a dragon in the astral. Good or bad dragon I will let you decide

No. That would be too New Age-like. It is drawn as seen from top, covered with lines, that look like bones, or some pattern, with two eyes, big mouth, and tail fin placed not vertically, but horizontally. From what I know there's no fish species that have horizontal tail fin.

<section>
This topic is pretty appealing, but I do have to side with Nay on this one. When I experience it, I'll be less critical. At this point, even if I saw someone as a dragon in the astral, I would probably see that as a particular interpretation of that person rather than a true form. Maybe it's the same thing.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, if it is true about people being dragons and the like, then certainly people are biased to what they see in themselves and others. Maybe if there was a double blind study where two people interpreted someone as the same creature, it would be more convincing.
<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, I think souls are pretty much formless.

As for that birthmark, your description kind of reminds me of the Egyptian or Greek drawings of dolphins. See:

What you've seen is pretty much happening all around the world right now. Nature spirits are incarnating more and more frequently now to help save Mother Earth in a more active physical way from all the damage the human race is causing her.

Yes, a aura scan would be interesting.  Though you have to be in person to do this, but if you were to project then it would be only a simple matter for you to find the person, right?  Well if so then I would also like to be subject to this, I would be interested with the results.

<section>
Hi VesAn,
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I could teach you how to do it more than I can tell you how I go about it and what I see.
<br>
<br>
During a typical session in my psychic development circle, we'll first go through a guided meditation. This pretty much gets us relaxed, gets our energies raised and gets us attuned with the spirit world. This really assists any psychic work we do as the energies in the room and within us are all just right. After the meditation we'll go into practicing things like psychometry or reading auras.
<br>
<br>
We usually sit in low candle light, so the more light sensitive portion of our eyes, such as peripheral vision, is given a better chance to work for us. Typically there'll be a time when some of the others are still in a meditative state - they are relaxed, their eyes are closed, and you get to see their "at rest" face.
<br>
<br>
At this time, you open yourself up to both your intuition and your imagination, and you take a good look at the other persons face in the low light.  You will "imagine" you can see other features kind of overlayed on their face, or that their face takes on an aspect of something or someone else. This aspect could be anything from an animal or spirit guide that is prevolent in that person, to a past life incarnation of that person, which is where you'll see indications that the person is an incarnated nature spirit or angel.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes the features are so strong in a person that you don't need that quiet time and half light to see.  Their physical features will often show what their spirit was before its present incarnation.  Think of a particular nature spirit, such as an elf, goblin (an earth spirit), fairy, tree spirit, think of what they might look like, then take a look at some people around you.
<br>
<br>
Now to one more controversial thought.....
<br>
As much as I'm still somewhat reserved about my thoughts on aliens, the fairy folk are quite well aware of, and quite adamant that "star-people" are also incarnating among us. I was sceptical about this until I looked at a girl in her late teens in a shopping centre that had a very quiet, studious look about her, who had a thin flat face, small nose, small mouth, and very large almond shaped eyes. I looked at her and thought OMG...ET!!!
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

Sorry, but you are totally wrong about this one. I am currently developing a 3D crpg game, so I know something about it, and I am sure that you can't call point isometric. Only a transformation can be called called isometric, when it preserves lenghts of defined object.

Douglas, ha ha, I did the same.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I guess there is nothing wrong with people exploring the realms of creative imagination. The only problems arise, as far as I can tell, is when people start believing in it as something other than creative fantasy. You see this a lot on the PSD forum where people seriously believe they are being "attacked" by "negs". At least on the whole the "drags" appear relatively harmless, lol.
<br>
<br>
I guess in hindsight we'll be able to tell whether these kinds of fads were just an idle distraction, or a necessary part of the process. They do appear, at least on the surface, to be opening young people's minds to the idea of their inner self. But I know what you mean. Many demonstrate the product of having too much information, coupled with too little understanding. :)

 Is this the latest fad? You are giving the rest of us a bad name!

 Once again Manga/anime has worked its wicked way with gullable folk's minds!

 Just a bet, but I am guessing that '2012' and a 'demon war' is also connected with dragons in some way? I wouldnt be overly suprised... a variation of the same material

Actually, no. And no, it's not a variation of the same material. You ever hear of shamanism? you should look into it sometime, cause this is what we are talking about. I am not talking about the fake shaminism that is taught, either. This is not a fad: it's quite simple actually. Shamans use animal symbolism all the time, and shaminism is one of the oldest practices.
<br>
<br>
And, as for anime and manga, I myself am a big fan of such. However, I do not believe you can do the things in anime and manga. I disagree, however, with your take on it as I do notice it "gets the ball rolling" for individuals getting into this stuff.
<br>
<br>
for any of you projectors disagreeing with this, why don't you project with one of us and see for yourself?

<section>
In a way it raises another question Frank and Gandalf. Is it possible to be led astray so to speak. If we assume that there is a right and wrong reality or nature or laws governing the multilayer dimensional universe, astral world or whatever we call it, would it not hinder rather than help in the gathering of information to facilitate growth. In another thread Mustang has gone to great lengths to expose the false hoods of Castaneda as an author in anything but the realm of fiction, but some get rather irritated and critical saying that it does not matter if he tells the truth or not, and they then experiment with various plants datura etc and draw conclusions in real life based on this fiction. Where is the line and when does it become counter productive. One could argue that Fundamentalist Muslim thought or Christianity for that matter also have aspects of truth and so they might also be beneficial. It is an interesting point that almost deserve a thread on its own so maybe I will make it.

 <br>
 If only things were that simple...
 <br>
 <br>
 Besides obvious difficulties with inducing a true projection at just about the right time, and just about to go anywhere at will, the observations in such a state are clouded with expectations.
 <br>
 <br>
 Even if I could do such a thing, my observations would be influenced by pre-existing opinions,  and what I would observe would not to be anyone's liking......right or wrong.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the unlikely scneario that a fairly experienced projector (which I consider myself to be) would overcome the above, it is quite possible to shape shift in an OBE state. In fact, somewhere in these boards I have talked about shapeshifting into a giant lizard, and at other times into a panther. I'm still human however.
 <br>
 <br>
 In short, a 'challenge' isn't really what this topic should be about, and merely serves as a rhetorical argument, since the difficullties asociated with such an endeavor would be pretty apparant to anyone familiar with OBEs.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
A true OBE is not so unfullfilling a thing, a truly powerfull OBE is quite strong and full of form. This does, of course, depend on the way you are going about your OBE.
<br>
<br>
A truly experienced projector would know that each individual has different ways of going about an OBE, and that each way produces different results. The best way that you can find for yourself should produce an OBE strong enough to make concrete assertations in the astral/obe/mental realms.
<br>
<br>
Usually, the closer you are to having a complete shutdown of the body, the stronger and more concrete the OBE. Or, for some, they can mentally project instead with much the same results.
<br>
<br>
In short, your little pip about "experienced" projectors does not ring true with me. I have been projecting for 5-6 years.

Shapeshifting and having the same essence of what you look like are quite different. I don't just look like a dragon, I feel like one to other individuals.

As stated above, so stated here. Any projector who is quite experienced and can actually have a real astral projection instead of a partial one, can do this. I have done so with several people allready.

Since you have projection experience, it shouldn't be as hard as learning to project the first time. Eventually you should learn methods that allow you to project on the spot and to project powerfully (the two usually are not the same method.)

well, a lot has happened since that experience, some thing have been discarded, new things learned
<br>
i would say that i have dragon qualities, and very close connection to dragons
<br>
as for verifying actually being incarnated dragon, the matter is rather difficult to discern, and not all factors have been included up to date, but part of my soul family is dragon/reptilian according to current information
<br>
still i am verifying this, and developing more methods to verify it,  it is rather easy to become delusioned
<br>
as for accuracy, all of us has some issues with it

as for common sense, i have it, as well as abilities that i confirmed

still, i trust my soul, myself, and dragon is maintaining integrity for the time being, there is no absolute truth for me, and it could be that i will abandon it, still, remeber that it is

 <br>
 I think you misunderstood the point. Like I said earlier, rhetorical arguments such as 'come see for yourself' or basicaly saying that if you disagree then you're not experienced enough or able to project well enough does not make any sense to me as an argument.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
If you feel I have made claims as to anyone's experiences, I apolagize, it was not my intent.
<br>
<br>
However, as stated before, if individuals are willing to listen, then perhaps I can give a few shreds of evidence. Too often on this website have I encountered close minded people who would not listen to what I have had to say.
<br>
<br>
Also, as stated, it's the essence behind the dragon that is felt and formed, not actually being a dragon.
<br>
<br>
when I project, I often find myself, automatically and without thinking about it, in a dragon form.
<br>
<br>
Also, for most individuals totem animals are symbolically important, hence the reason they think of themselves as such. A quick search on google found a site which provides such information:
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.crystalinks.com/totemanimals.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.crystalinks.com/totemanimals.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
please don't be confused, when I say "I am a dragon," I am more so saying that I reflect some of the dragon's likeness and my astral form sometimes takes the form of a dragon.
<br>
<br>
Hope this clears some things up.

 I would however warn against the trappngs of taking them too literal where they too quickly serve the self-esteem rather than nourish the soul.

<br>
At first, I was quite afraid of the idea to tell the truth. However, because of my experiences I have found that I simply could not say "no" to the idea of being a dragon.
<br>
<br>
My spirit guide tells me I am more connected to dragon's than most individuals, but since she was telling me this during the time I was testing her I took it with a grain of salt.
<br>
<br>
We each have our own paths, I gueess mine is less symbolic than others. It was a very personal and powerfull experience.

This is my first time posting here since the site was changed (looks good by the way
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
).
<br>
<br>
about a year and a half ago (my last AP,due to anti-anxiety meds
<img alt=":cry:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cry.png" title="Cry"/>
),I had an incredible astral experience that relates to this topic.shed some light on what happened if you can:
<br>
<br>
I spontaneously was "given" a technique for astral projection in which I combined "astral breathing" techniques while I was lifting away from my body (exhaling/rising/repeat).I passed through the ceiling of my room,which became a water-barrier (astral doorway).after I left the watery ocean type area,I found that I was in a kind of dark grey darkness.Then,I noticed that something
<b>
 BIG
</b>
was coming through to the area I was
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///in.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 in.It
</a>
was a massive 2-headed dragon.I was terrified!!
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
It shape-shifted into a dark, humanoid form and, "gave" me a picture of who it was.The picture showed me a black and white illustration of a powerful dragon,with long curving necks,and massive body and tail.The name for this creature was a
<i>
 symbol
</i>
:  &lt;, and C (like a sideways U),,both connected,one over the top of the other, to the right side of a vertical line .
<br>
<br>
I was so terrified that I decided that if it is a lower astral entity,i could escape it be entering higher levels.I told myself "I need to experience an ascention of conciousness".I then came to an area that could only be described as being made of
<i>
 light
</i>
,with shimmering transparent colors mixed in with the light.
<br>
<br>
then someone else in the house started talking loud,and i was drawn back,but just before I entered my body again,I was shocked to realize that
<u>
 the shapeshifter was WAITING BESIDE MY BODY!
</u>
.I quickly  dove into my body,while the shape-shifter was softly chuckling at my terror.
<br>
<br>
<br>
needless to say,it was quite an experience,but I haven't been able to shed furthur light on the situation by returning,due to a severe kind of "numbing" that the meds seem to have on my energy levels/astral sensitivity while in physical (like I could reach the "edge' of the astral just by relaxing and meditating).
<br>
<br>
I would like to add that while I haven't been able to project for some time to return to this 2 headed dragon (I can't believe I said that),I have been drawn,coincidentally (or syncronicity) to a series of novels of a man called "the dragon reborn".a possible interesting "trickle-down from the astral" effect.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 anyone
</i>
,please try to shed light on this situation!
<br>
<br>
hmmm...........
