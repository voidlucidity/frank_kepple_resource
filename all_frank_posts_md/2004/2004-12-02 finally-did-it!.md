<section>
After about 3 or 4 weeks of trying to project I did it!  It was a little scary at first but exciting too.  I only did it for under 10 seconds like Robert Bruce suggested(good advice too because the memory of it is similar to a dream).
<br>
<br>
Basically I had been getting lucid dreams pretty often now.  And someone here suggested I say "take me to my body now!" and lo and behold I woke up mentally but not physically and the sinking feeling, followed by the wind sound and vibrations(They were pretty mild actually).  Then I could see my astral hands in front of me.  I tried to do the rope technique but that didn't work.  So what I did was reach for the edge of my door that was a little open and pull(that took a little bit of effort).  And then I popped right out.  Gave a quick prayer floated down the hallway and then I don't think I said anything but just thought of my body and started to fly back inside(I didn't see my body) and shouted "I will remember this".
<br>
<br>
I was half expecting something waiting for me when I popped out. Like a lower astral being or something.  I was ready to tell him off.  But there wasn't one.
<br>
<br>
So any recommendations on how soon I start exploring, asking for my spirit guide, and all that stuff?  Should my next few projections be ultra short as well?

If I were you, I would probably keep the next ones short as well, although it's very tempting to just go about your business and fly around the place!
<br>
<br>
Congrats on your first projection!

Hi markulous,
<br>
<br>
Good for you! My advice would be to do exactly what you did before and try to recreate the conditions of your first success.When you hit on a technique that works, stick with it. I`m a big believer in the keep it simple approach.  Getting a few more exits under your belt should be your main focus. Have fun with it!
<br>
<br>
Cheers

LOL...I'm happy for you, really...it just seems very funny that I have tried to project for over an year now and you did it in 3-4 weeks...lol

I like to have my goals ready ahead of time before I project, so I'm not just walking around my house thinking... "This is cool... what do I want to do?" That way you can start experimenting immediately, since time is often short. For me, it's things like... walking through walls, practicing flying, shapechanging, looking in mirrors, etc.

Night Mist, don't feel too bad. I've been studying and practicing for nearly two years, and I've still not had a fully conscious exit. I'm not too disappointed at this point though, lucid dreams and dream projecting is fun too, as are the secondary benefits of OBE practice =).
<br>
<br>
Markulous, congratulations on your first success. Keep up the good work and keep us posted on any further experiences you have.

<section>
Thanks for the good luck everyone.  I could of had another one today!  I was in a lucid dream and I was thinking okay cool I am going to ask for my body but then something told me I was almost already awake so I had to wait a while.  So I said okay make me lucid in 10 minutes but that didn't work...
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>

<br>
I wouldn't feel bad if it takes a few years or so.  I probably had them when I was a kid and didn't know it.  I realized about a week ago when I was in middle school I was about to have an OBE.  I thought there was a demon in my room(he said "hear my voice" and started yelling other stuff but I was too busy praying) and there was the same wind sound that I know hear.  When it was probably just an astral voice.
<br>
<br>
Maybe after 5-10 OBE's I will ask for my spirit guide.  I think I need to play it cool right now and just learn how to move around and have some control.

I don't mean to spoil the celebration, but...

<br>
If you didn't see your body, then you really weren't "out of body," were you?

I am pretty sure in Astral Dynamics it said sometimes you might not see your body on reentry.  Even if that wasn't the case I probably wouldn't have saw it anyway.  My blanket goes past my chin and I have a pillow on top of my head.  So the only thing "revealed" would be some of my mouth which the pillow would cast a shadow on.
<br>
<br>
I know dreams and I know lucid dreams.  This was NOTHING like either one.  It was an OBE.

I know precisely what you mean. I have had experiences identical to what you've described, and they've felt completely different from dreams and lucid dreams. Certainly, it is a wonderful experience, and congratulations!
<br>
<br>
However, like you, I don't see my body. Since we have never seen our bodies, how can we say that we've had an OBE... for how can we be out of body when we can't see where we left it? Is it because Astral Dynamics says so?

I understand your point.  But some things can be seen don't actually exist.  And others that can't be seen do exist.  Visual sight does not equal truth.

<section>
It's not like you took your eyes out of body either. If your astral sight doesn't see something, its no big deal. Heck, with my regualr eyes I'm not that observant either, so why should astral sight be any better? Especially when astral sight has to interpret things differently.

<section>
I have had few OBEs, I had orientation problems when I had them, I did not see my body in the reentry!! I am sure that will develop with practice or can be there with people naturally. But I am sure its no criteria that if you don't see your body you are not projecting.
<br>
<br>
Lets understand this!! and please correct me if I am wrong, Astral world is at a slightly higher frequency than physical and I think its quite possible to not see your physical self and reenter....thoughts people!!

<section>
Yes, don't get preoccupied if you can or can't see your body.  All you're doing when you go OBE is projecting your consciousness to other places.  If you don't see your body, it's only because you aren't perceiving it there, for whatever reason.
<br>
<br>
I have had hundreds of projections, and I may have seen my body on two occasions.  Not a big deal, and it certainly doesn't detract from the experience.

<section>
Yes, I agree. People get far too hung up on the "body" thing in my opinion. We are a point of consciousness and have the ability to create a "body" or not. If you feel more secure with a body then simply create one. Why not go the whole hog and create a matching "silver chord" to go with it. LOL  Myself, as I've said a number of times before, I'm too busy exploring to worry about what "body" I'm creating.
<br>
<br>

Not to mention that when you are projecting you aren't usually in the domain of the physical either.  What Bruce calls the "Real-time zone" I think of as the Penumbra (for you White Wolf fans out there).  The layer of reality that is the closest energetic vibration to that of physical reality.  That being said, you may see or not see your body because in that vibrational state your mind holds more sway over your surroundings... like as in a dream.
<br>
<br>
Ive often wondered if there are levels of energetic vibration MORE stable than that of this physical reality we are born into.  Often I think of something and it manifests itself in my life.  Is there a level of reality where things are MORE concrete and stable?

Interesting thought! (and cool user name and signature
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
)
<br>
<br>
I would venture to say no. Our knowledge of this reality's stability is accelerating through empirical science everyday.
<br>
<br>
Also, my own metaphysical experiences verify this. When I have a particularly high energy astral experience, I sometimes "fall," either deliberately or mistakenly, and go through all of the energy sensations until a very observable "thump," which happens before I awake. This "thump" is quite abrupt, although painless, and before I open my eyes and realize I'm in the real world, I feel that I'm on the lowest point in the universe, the absolute ground - the first few times I thought I was in hell.
<br>
<br>
Imagine my supreme laughter at the irony when I realized I was in the real world!

Major Tom, that's fascinating! Have you heard of that happening with anyone else? It'd be a spooky thing to see yourself wanding around.

Thanks Telos!  I decided on the name and then figured if I was going to borrow the name from Shakespeare I could plagorize my signature as well.  Its from act II, scene ii of The Tempest.
<br>
<br>
Back on topic, sort of, another thing that I would like to someday experiment with is moving my body while "out" of it.  I think that would be interesting.  People speak of the dual awareness... it would be interesting to try to control the body while projecting. DON'T try to talk me out of it!
