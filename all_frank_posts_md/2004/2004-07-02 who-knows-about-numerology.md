I'm a true numerology believer. i'm just finishing my 9 year cyucle, and if not the knowledge I have about numerology I'd shoot myself straight away;) It's so logical! also understanding the life paths of my number (I'm 11) has really helped me understand my life.
<br>

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Hannah, I just finished my 9 year and am also an 11, which is really 2..  the number for relationships to all things, in my simplified understanding.  Cool.
<br>
<br>
Majour, 3 for me signifies the effort I put in to a spiritual connection.  It is represented by a triangle.. pointing the way for our effort.
<br>
<br>
There will be more detailed information at those sites hannah supplied links to.
<br>
<br>
1 cents worth.

Majour Ka,
<br>
<br>
Those sites are good but they don't do a thorough calculation for Master Numbers..  A Master Number is a number like 11 or 22, which are higher vibrations of the numbers that they break down to, like the 2 from the 11 or 4from the 22. For example, an 11 is 1+1=2, or a 22 is 2+2=4.  That site that Hannah mentioned at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///freesoul.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 freesoul.com
</a>
broke down all of my Master Numbers into the lower vibrational numbers, so it is good for the basics but the formulas need tweaking if you want a truly accurate reading.
<br>
<br>
When doing a reading, a good numerologist will always leave all of you Master Numbers in tact becasue they represent your highest potential.  In fact, Master numbers are rare enough, however, in spiritual communities, you will find higher concentrations of them becsause of the interests of people who have Master numbers in their names.  This is why here, at AP you will find more people with Master Numbers in their charts than perhaps other places they are interested in furthering their spiritual development and are usually more open to learning and understanding.
<br>
<br>
The reason I know this is because I have been into numerology since I was about 22, when I found out I have 3 master numbers in my name.  My Life path number is a 3, like yours which is a number if creative expression, yet, my personality numbers are all Master Numbers, usually one will have one or 2 Master numbers associated with their charts but almost never 3.  When keeping the integrity of the full potential of my entire birth name, my Soul Urge (hearts desire) is a 22, My Quiescent number (Outer Personality) is a 55 and my Expression number (reason for this incarnation) is a 77.  Derived from Kerri Anne Edelman.   When I got married, I kept my numerological chart by changing my name to Kerri AE Kannan.
<br>
<br>
I could go into great detail about this but I just don't have the time right now.  Numerology is a great way of figuring out how you are different from others and will give you insight into your purpose while in this incarnation.
<br>
<br>
A great numerologist who goes into great depth about the Master numbers in particular is
<u>
 The Master Numbers: A New Approach to Understanding Yourself Through Numerology
</u>
by Korra Deaver.  Unfortunately, Deaver had been sick for a while and this book is out of print.  I heard, however, that she is doing better and is writing again, you might want to do a search to find maybe some of her new work... I'm sure if she is, you can do an Amazon search and find some of her newer works.
<br>
<br>
Good luck... Numerology can be very eye opening and give you great insights into your personality and your purpose here.
<br>
<br>
Love &amp; Life,
<br>
Kerri

<section>
Tayesin,
<br>
hey that's pretty cool!;)
<br>
Was the 9th really bad for you??do you see a difference now that it's over??
<br>
here is some good info on what the 11 really is:
<br>
<br>
this is from the astrocenter site:
<br>
<br>
If your Life-Path number is ELEVEN, yours is a Master Vibration number associated with spiritual awareness. Master Vibration people tend to possess an understanding and knowledge beyond others. As an ELEVEN, you are thought of as being on a higher spiritual plane.
<br>
ELEVENS tend to be very interesting people with much to offer those around them. They are intuitive, avant-garde, idealistic and cultured - extremely so. They are the visionaries. It's common to find an ELEVEN looking for understanding in life's mysteries. Their interests will be many. Socially, connections with others are highly developed. ELEVENS bring much to the topic of conversation and are excellent listeners.
<br>
An ELEVEN will expect much from themselves and from others. At times this can make them difficult to deal with. It's common for this Life-Path to have a lot of nervous tension. There can be mood swings and challenges with focus on ambition. At times actions can be impractical, as an ELEVEN is more of a dreamer than a doer. Key words/qualities associated with an ELEVEN Life-Path are higher spiritual plane, intuitive, illumination, idealistic and a dreamer.
<br>
The life purpose for an ELEVEN is to utilize innate skills of counseling and guidance. While you may not be a leader, much talent can show through in this area. Finding ways to release nervous energy such as sports and exercise can bring much relief during difficult times.
<br>
<br>
I know taht we are a 2 also, but my astrologist told me that people with master numbers always have a choice in either being a 2 or 11 etc. I choose to be 11;)
<br>
<br>
And this is for all the "3's" (also from
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///astrocenter.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 astrocenter.com
</a>
)
<br>
<br>
Your Life-Path number is probably the most influential numerological aspect to be considered. This number is determined by your birth date and represents who you are at this time. It indicates specific traits that are present and will likely be active and influential throughout your lifetime. It is the overall number that determines much of what will be important to you and how you will handle things as they come.
<br>
If your Life-Path number is THREE, your life is likely to be characterized by the undying need for expression. This can take the form in conversation but also in the arts. Typically, the THREE has an above-average ability in some art form. This can encompass painting, interior decorating, crafts, writing, music, drama or all of the above.
<br>
Enjoying the company of like minded creative people is likely to be on your top ten list of pleasures. THREE'S are genuinely warm and friendly. They make excellent friends by sharing interesting information and by actively listening. Entertaining in your home comes readily for most THREE'S as you can make everyone feel at home. With such a sunny disposition and openhearted approach, others will naturally seek out your hospitality. Key words for a THREE Life-Path number are expression, verbalization, socialization, the joy of living, the arts and travel.
<br>
As a THREE, you're likely to be an entertainer either formally or within your social circle. You're one of the effervescent, sparkling people in the world with an eternal optimism. Things will rarely get a THREE down. Setbacks will be just a part of the overall scheme of things and won't keep you from feeling positive. This exuberant demeanor and love of life can take a THREE to great lengths when creative expression is developed.
<br>
With this in mind, the THREE'S life purpose is to develop self-expression in a tangible, productive means. It's important to nail down the artistic outlets that you thrive most in. The best work will be produced when a THREE focuses on their own personal expression and not what the market wants. This isn't always an easy path, yet it will be richly rewarding. Optimism is a powerful tool for the actively expressive THREE.
<br>
Because of the THREE'S innate love of fun and living for the moment, challenges can develop. It can be common to lack foresight and this thinking can bring about overspending, unexpected moodiness and unproductivity. Further, the love of just having fun can lead towards escapism. Scattered focus can create a situation where there's a lot of activity without results. The THREE is wise to develop set goal plans and to learn solid balance between creative work and social fun.
<br>
<br>
Lighthouse, ofcourse I agree with everything you said, I know that numerology is a lot more than a game. thanks for making it clear;)

<br>
So you are a Leo, Majour.. you don't come across as the egotist that Leo usually is.  Which is gr8.
<br>
<br>
Being 33 indicates a gateway year for spiritual learning, meaning the energy is specifically supporting your spiritual effort for growth in that year.
<br>
<br>
Your Birth number is a 3 also !!  This year, after your birthday, is a 9 year for you, a time for completing what you have been working on for the past 8 years.  It will also hold the seeds of things for a new beginning next year.
<br>
<br>
<u>

<br>
the 9 year wasn't so bad.  I had expectations for it, none of which came about, LOL.  In hindsight, I can see how things came to their conclusions and what embryonic things were growing towards the new 1 year.  Nothing actually eased up as far as day to day life is concerned, yet new things have come my way, new insights into my work and tasks here etc.  So it is working out.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Hannah and Lighthouse for the information.  A few years ago a picked up a book at the library because it was glowing at me.. it was called, "The Life You Were Born To Live" by Dan Millman ( I think he wrote it)
<br>
<br>
Each birthdate series is discussed in detail, everyone I lent it to freaked out when reading the section about themselves, because they thought the author was writing about them !!  It's worth a look if you can get hold of it.
<br>
<br>
I learned a little from a numerologist about the same time, although my understanding is extremely basic, I only use it for doing basic charts which in turn fire up the Insight, much like Tarot Cards do with a good reader.  I like the basics much more than the full discription, mainly for time saving, LOL.  A basic insight reading only takes a few minutes then.. the numbers indicate the life chosen and will illustrate how you are doing in comparison to your intentions.
<br>
<br>
Do see if you can find a copy of that book, it is truly brilliant.
<br>
<br>
Love Always. [

Thanks Tayesin,
<br>
<br>
I'll look up that book too... Major Ka, just a little tidbit to add to what Tayesin said, (I think we're twins!!!) This is my 33 year (right now) and it truly is a year of spiritual growth for me.  This is also a 9 year for me, (born Dec 28, 1970) a year of endings I'm moving to NY this summer and so that in itself is an end to a chapter in my life.  Additionally, my oldest daughter starts Kindergarten so she will no longer be home... that's an end of a certain chapter.  With the 33 I'm delving into so many spiritual books and am going through a major growth spurt (but I feel like I'm always going through major growth spurts) I'm reading about one book every week that pertains to all things spiritual.
<br>
<br>
The changes of the 9 are not so bad on one hand yet very difficult on the other... I can't really go into that right now but I think it's a matter of allowing the universe to do its job and let go of control.  [

<br>
<br>
Anyway, Numerology is great fun and it's amazing how many people really see themselves in the charts.  If you have specific questions, (since we are twins) please feel free to PM me... as you already know.
<br>
<br>
Have Fun!
<br>
<br>
Kerri

He he, I remember when I was 33 in that year I moved into a house that was number 33. What significance that was I don't know. I moved out 10 years later if that is any help to the numerologists on board.
