<section>
My apologies to those who read my original post about this:
<br>
<br>
I posted part of this in the phasing forum, but I see now I didn't post the full story, so I've amended my post [:I]
<br>
<br>
I'm looking for insight into whether anyone thinks this was advanced hypnogogic imagery, seeing through my eyelids, or a brief AP as a point of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
A couple of weeks ago I had been reading the posts on the forum on the computer which is in my bedroom before deciding it was a good time to practice OBE/AP.
<br>
<br>
After reading Cube's post on watching your body fall asleep I ignored the uncomfortable feeling and resisted moving.  I watched/felt my body fall asleep (the sinking feeling) a total of 3 times and did see hypnogogic images.  On one of these occasions I was in REM (my eyes were moving around uncontrollably) but was still 100% aware.  I then saw a large camera flash go off in my 3rd eye.
<br>
<br>
After this happened I felt like I was floating around my bedroom, everything was ultra-real; full colour, better than best quality DVD (no sound though but I wouldn't expect it in my bedroom). I had been on the forum and left my computer logged into the forum. I started floating straight towards the computer and I had the feeling I could have floated straight into it, like actually "into" the posts, if that's possible! I got a little worried about being trapped in the computer, lol!  I then tried to see my body but found I lost focus from here, and at that point the image faded away and I was back in my body but again with no sensations/vibrations. At no point during this did I feel like I was in a body of any sort, although I was aware during this that my body was lying on my bed, hence why I tried to see it.
<br>
<br>
I felt no vibrations, at least only gentle sensations, not like the violent vibrations that have been described in many posts.
<br>
<br>
I haven't been using bwgen, but I have been reading many of the posts on phasing and have been focusing on awareness in points in my brain, moving energy between left/right hemispheres and in particular a point somewhere in the middle.
<br>
<br>
So what was this? I have never had hypnogogic images like this before, nor have I had the impression of everything being extra-real, ultra-clear and sharp (like a DVD) in my dreams.

Smells like phased AP to me.  It can suprisingly simple to do (much easier than OBE), but harder for me to control (always short durations, under 1 minute).  Or far-seeing, but I think it's the same thing, just how much energy goes with you or stays behind.

I got the impression something is missing in between the flash and you floating in your room. Perhaps some loss of lucidity right there?
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, given your floating out of the body was preceded by some hypnagogic stuff, you may have made the transition suddenly. Some people keep their awareness focused on their spatial position in the trasnition in which case I would expect vibrations are more likely to occur. Others may temporarily forget all together about their spatial position (which easily happens when experiencng hypnagogic imagry) and you may sort of find yourself suddenly OBE in a less classic manner, or you may have in fact phased directly into your bedroom as Rastus mentioned.
<br>
<br>
Not sure exactly what your question is. Everything about it sounds like an OBE to me.
<br>
<br>
Point of consciousness type of projections tend to be different though, and are quite rare. Perhaps yoyu simply did not pay attention to your "astral body" while floating that makes you say point of consciousness? You probably would see something resembling a body if you paid attention to it.
<br>
<br>
The hypnagogic images and flashes (as well as vibrations) are all precursors of your loosing your physical body senses, with the ability to OBE into your bedroom or phase our further not far around the corner.
<br>
<br>
Ultrareal and sharp? Welcome to the wonderful world of OBEs!

Thanks Rastus &amp; Major Tom for clearing that up for me.
<br>
<br>
MT you are right, there must have been some loss of lucidity as I don't remember anything in between the camera flash and floating around my bedroom.
<br>
<br>
As I was floating towards my computer I never stopped to check &amp; see if I had an astral body, it just didn't feel as if I was in one.  In fact, had I not worried about going into the computer, I probably would not even have realized what had happened.  This may go some way to explaining why I could never differentiate between AP and the physical as a child, and why I was so confused when people told me what I knew had happened never did! (I am only now putting the pieces together).  A few months ago I was visualising myself floating out of my window where I live now (an AP visualisation technique I read about) and found myself, once out of the window, flying down the street of my childhood home.  It was a moment of clarity for me and through this a lot of memories came to the surface and explained themselves.
<br>
<br>
I guess, for myself, I need to spend some serious time meditating, quieting my mind, focusing on being fully present in the moment, in order to become aware of when I am not; I have often found myself "losing time".  Frequent reality checks would probably be a good idea too, focus being the resolution for this also.

Everything about it sounds to me like you had a short obe into the real-time zone. Personally, I never get hung up about whether I'm in a "body" or not and if so what type, and all that jazz. I just get on with exploring. Sometimes you may feel you are within a body and sometimes not. This is normal.
<br>
<br>
Same with the vibrations too. Sometimes you feel them strongly, sometimes not at all and sometimes they can come over like gentle waves. Other times you may feel a kind of static electricity type of feeling which is often accompanied by buzzing and/or a crackling sound.
<br>
<br>
Your comments about it being ultra-real and in full colour, yep, that's how it should be. Though not everyone is fortunate enough to experience that so soon. Often people are groping in the dark the first few attempts. When you are within the astral too, everything should normally be as real and as clear as when you are within the physical.
<br>
<br>
I think maybe your protective sense of awareness prevented you from seeing your physical. I'd advise anyone to be a tad cautious about doing this, as it can immediately throw up some pretty strong emotional feelings about having died and stuff. If it had been me I'd have gone straight into the computer, and I bet you would have emerged within the astral somewhere.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck with the next one.

Yours,
