<section>
Hello:
<br>
<br>
About twice a day, mainly when my Popupstopper blocks a popup, I get a small window coming up that says a "runtime error" has occured and do I wish to debug, Yes or No? So I click on No and everything works as normal.
<br>
<br>
Is there a way I can switch this off?
<br>
<br>
Once, out of sheer curiosity, I clicked yes and it loaded some kind of Microsoft debugging utility which I hadn't seen before. I think what my system is detecting are missing bits in the programs of some of the websites I visit. I'm sure it's not my machine that is faulty.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, I never do want to debug, so I'm thinking there must surely be a way of just setting the default answer to No so it never comes up.
<br>
<br>
Any pointers will be gratefully received.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Do you use the Internet Explorer? If so, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced.
<br>
<br>
Under Browsing, activate "Disable script debugging".
<br>
<br>
<br>
If that doesn't help, try to uninstall your popup blocker and reinstall it. (If you haven't done so already)

Frank, if you wish for the popup for this site notifying you of private messages recieved on this site then go to internet security and from there you can select "ignore popups from this site"

Switching from IE to Firefox works well, too.
