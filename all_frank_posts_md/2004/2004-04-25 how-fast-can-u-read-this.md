I received this message as an e-mail.
<br>
<br>
Simply fascinating what the brain can do. I remember reading somewhere. When a person reads something, if punctuation or spelling is incorrect. The person reading then gets irritated &amp; discards most of the message??? True???
<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought this to be very interesting.

Pretty cool, never seen that before.  I was a little suprised to find that I had no trouble reading it at all, which I guess varifies what it says.  Not really useful, but it took a couple seconds out of my bordom.

It's not all

 'bout -u- OH Great God Of Fire!!!
</font>
Or maybe it is??? So -u- must be one of the people that it irritates, when someone uses wrong punctuation or miss spelled words. Ya know I have a question for -u-... Does it irritate -u- because those others didn't study as hard as -u- did??? Or How could they miss that, kind of attitude??? Non of the above? Do tell what ur quark is!!!
<br>
Did -u- ever stop and think of why -u- might keep running into it??? Is there something -u- need to learn from it, something to it?

Are you a bit daft? im sick of seeing the damn thing and thats all, it has nothing to do with it not being spelt right or anything - like all things if they get seen too many times it gets irritating. Now go have a cigar.

I read that quicker than I read english. It was easier to read that. I guess it's because I usually read words. BUt here, there were NO WORDS so I searched only for the point.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It's not just that the mind reads words as a whole, it logically anticipates what words may follow from what has just gone. Plus, I'm not sure why we need some scientist from xyz university to tell us we read whole words and not individual letters. I mean, I don't know about anyone else but I even see and read whole groups of words at once, and even whole common sentences (gasp). That'll set the scientists off no doubt. :)
<br>
<br>
Soon they'll be telling us we eat food with a knife and fork, and some people use chopsticks, wow.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

its good to bring that jumble to the fore, watched a program called "dyslexia the myth" recently and that word is coated over so many people of varying spelling inabilities.
<br>
I welcome more research in this area for language read write communication is paramount an will lead to smarter AI
