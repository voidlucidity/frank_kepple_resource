Hello!
<br>
<br>
I occasionally get this when I try to access the Forums.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Warning: mysql_connect(): User astralp_apforums has already more than 'max_user_connections' active connections in /home/astralp/public_html/forums/db/mysql4.php on line 48

 <br>
 phpBB : Critical Error
 <br>
 <br>
 Could not connect to the database
</span>
<br>
<br>
Is it me, in that can I do anything to prevent it?
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>
<br>
Sarah

Sarah- it's not you; too many people were trying to connect at once. It's a phpBB problem.
