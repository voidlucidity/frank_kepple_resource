<section>
I have lately noticed that some "friendly" negative entities has put a mask over my head. This mask is not noticeable when touching the face, or the hair... When touching the haid it is like there is nothing there... However when I touch my neck upwards, I feel my hands going under something... I pull it off, and feels like a mask covering my entire head.
<br>
<br>
I have some spirits around me that are usually quite nice, however they do NOT get happy and nice when I try to take this thing off.
<br>
<br>
Anyone know what it might be?
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLEASE, no guessings! I do not want comments by people giving one guess after the other... If you do not know what it is, please do not reply... I much rather have no replies than a page full of guesses, I have enough of them myself. It has been many months since I posted last... Please show me that it is actually possible to post something on this forum and get clear relevants replies.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
With respect, if you would like a meaningful reply it would be helpful to supply some more background detail please. Such as the circumstances under which you feel this is occuring etc.

<section>
EOL007,
<br>
Thanks for the reply, normally I would provide more details, however I am now only interested to hear if anyone has experienced something similar, or is aware from other sources what this mask might have for purpose.
<br>
<br>
I could go into detail of my background with these entities, but the bottom line is that some entities (on the negative side) has put an energy mask over the head of my astral body, for whatever purpose. This mask is not visible, nor can it be felt by touching the head with the astral hands... It can however be felt by moving the hand upwards the neck, where the mask ends and then pull it off. When doing this, the entities do not get happy, and want me to keep it on... I have probably had it on for many months at least, and they did not get happy when I noticed I had it...
<br>
<br>
A guess on my side is that it causes vision problems for me when going over a certain vibrational range... they wanting keep me within a range they can reach... This is a bit based on they trying to convince me a while back to lower my vibrations, and telling me they could show me how to do it... I however told them no, and might have been the reason they put it on me.
<br>
<br>
This is however only a guess, and it might not do this at all... or do more... In any case, the mask is defenetely not a possitive thing, and "mask" might not be a proper term... perhaps energy covering is better... but feels like a mask when taking it off.
<br>
<br>
The reason I posted this was to see if anyone had experienced anything similar and found out what it was for... or read something that could describe it's purpose.
<br>
<br>
Obviously when this is occuring is when I am out of body, and feel with my hands upwards the neck. I then feel a covering, which I can take off...
<br>

Hi Patrik,
<br>
<br>
Respect that this mask (be it a sensation or something more tangible) can seem unnerving and strange to experience.
<br>
<br>
Personally (unless you can be very precise that it is attributed to Neg entities with clear evidence that that is the case) I feel this is simply one of two scenarios.
<br>
<br>
1. It is the sensation of expanded awareness of your own energy body and part of the throat, brow, crown chakra development.
<br>
<br>
2. It is possibly an ectoplasmic mask covering your face. There is plenty of information available on the net about this. Take time to look up physical mediumship in particular you may find it useful to contact the Noah's Ark society. Try a google for that.
<br>
<br>
If it helps I have experienced similar to what you have described and it is not something to worry about at all!
<br>
<br>
If it is an indicator of your potential as a physical medium then spirit would not want you to attempt to move or remove the ectoplasmic mask as this may cause energetic problems for you.
<br>
<br>
Examples of this are well understood in physical mediumship circles. Injuries can occur including burns and strong sensations in the plexuses especially the solar plexus, which can make one feel exceptional ill (likened to being kicked by a mule)!
<br>
<br>
I do not suspect that it is neg attributed in your case and recommend that you seek out an experienced medium who will be able to advise you how to manage your development with this type of highly specialised work with spirit. If it is a neg issue (which I doubt), again the experienced medium should be able to advise you accordingly!
<br>
<br>
In addition deep trance mediums doing physical work of this type can often be out of body (or slightly out of phase) while spirit are manipulating their ectoplasm etc.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand it may be simply a test in order for you to explore your own understanding of yourself at this time, and may or may not go further than has already done so thus far!
<br>
<br>
Hope this is of some help for you!
<br>
<br>
Kind wishes,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

<section>
Thanks, that actually helped a lot, I still have a very hard time thinking it anything but negative... but at least I have something to go on, and not as single minded towards it being negative.
<br>
<br>
My crown and 3rd eye chakras are very active, and have been ever since I began doing trance work. For instance just now when writing this, it feels like having a really really tight and heavy helmet around my head, with intense pressure on the 3rd eye. The throat chakra is not as active, but I do feel the pressure there very clearly.
<br>
<br>
I have a hard time thinking the mask is related to these energies. The spirits that was not happy for me taking the mask off have been known to attack me quite a bit in the past... However are usually quite friendly when they want to be... I do doubt they have only my best interest at heart.
<br>
<br>
The reason I am pointing towards it being negative is that it seems to be responsible for a lot of vision problems I have experienced in the astral. About a week ago I was out of body, suddenly began to experience vision problems like I have several times before... Felt like my eyelids were closing... it became black... I began to feel around my head, eyes seemd closed... could not open them... Felt down the neck, and this is were I first noticed the mask... I felt it, grabbed it and pulled it off my head...
<br>
<br>
I was now able to see again, no problem at all... and these 5 spirits came running towards me like I had done something really awful (from their point of view).
<br>
<br>
This mask does seem to be responsible for a lot of my vision problems, and I have a hard time thinking something good can cause something so bad... When leaving the body I have usually a hard time seeing, and the best way for me to began see is to either join the reality of a spirit (touching them, or they grabbing onto me, knowing I cannot see) or project to someplace in the inner planes...
<br>
<br>
This problem dissapeared when removing the mask, hence makes me assume it is responsible in one way or the other.
<br>
<br>
I really appreciate the reply you gave me, thank you.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your reply. Respect that if you are experiencing this out of body - then it may be something else altogether! I have also had lose of apparent sight in that state as well. I suspect that someone with more experience than myself with Astral work might pick this up differently, but glad my thoughts have helped to reassure you.
<br>
<br>
It is worth noting that the perception of vision in inner journeying is only the mind interpreting what you perceive with your extended senses, and that you are not actually seeing with physical eyes!
<br>
<br>
I suspect that Frank (for instance) would say something like 'thought becomes action' whilst OBE! So it may be worth considering using more positive intent if this occurs next time you are out and about exploring. It might help you to clear the veil from your eyes as it were!
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>
<br>

<section>
It is true that when we are out of body, we do not perceive sight as we do in physical. However being that we are so used to our physical bodies, the astral body replicates the same senses and perceptions of the energies.
<br>
<br>
Because of this, we also have eyelids in the astral, just for the obvious reason that we indeed are so used to having them. For this reason, having the eyelids closed will, because our focal point is situated at the eyes from being used to it, also cause our vision to dissapear.
<br>
<br>
In any case, regardless if I am having the focal point at the eyes as used to, or from the 3rd eye in another manner, such as 360 vision... The entire head, including the chakras controlling the perception is covered by this "mask", hence would result in my vision problems.
<br>
<br>
The point here however was not my problems regarding the vision, but the existence of a mask covering my head... and a mask which these spirits (which I have had a history of attacks with) do get very cranky when I try to remove it...
<br>
<br>
It is possible that the mask has some specific effect, and that the vision problems are by-products.
<br>
<br>
A new theory might be that this masks purpose is to prevent my higher chakras from functioning as they should. Which could explain why I feel the intense pressure on my higher chakras so often, it perhaps being the energies from the chakras wanting to get out, but unable to... Which also would explain why I have the vision problems... Which again could explain why I have not gotten real-time sight (ability to see into the astral during trance) for 5+ months or so...
<br>
<br>
But these are just theories, and one can build a lot of them...

Hi Patrik, i just have a quick question for you. When you say these entities have attacked you in the past, can you describe to me what actually happens during an attack, like what they do to you and what it feels like?

<br>
<br>
I believe you are answering your own question where you say,
<i>
 However being that we are so used to our physical bodies, the astral body replicates the same senses and perceptions of the energies
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
People can feel pressure in the head to the extent where it feels like a mask, and so it becomes. (Thought equals action within the non-physical.) For example, I used to get sensations a couple of years ago where it felt like some huge sucker-monster had attached itself to my back. Lately, I've been having sensations of "attachments" to my body like huge leaches have got their claws in me and I can't shake them off. But that's just the way the energy flows sometimes. You just have to accept it and move on.
<br>
<br>
You say there are "spirits" around you who would not be too pleased if you took the mask off. Well so what? If I baulked at every obstacle someone tried to put in my way I'd never get to explore anywhere!
<br>
<br>
All manner of people live within the astral realms and if you let yourself get bogged down about some imaginary mask and these spirits who are friendly sometimes but not at other times, you'll spend your non-physical life getting nowhere fast. Next time it happens have a good laugh about it and move on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Thanks all for the replies, Frank good to see you back on the board.
<br>
<br>
Earlier this morning I finally resolved it. I removed the mask, it was a 2-peace, one peace on the back, and one on the front. After having done this, I noticed that I did not only have a mask, but a full body suite... Having removed the mask seemed to have revealed the existence of this suite.
<br>
<br>
Attached to this suite was a cord, not at all like the silver cord... it was hard, and I was able to rip it apart. I removed the body suite, and underneath it was another one... I removed that one too...
<br>
<br>
Having done this, all my vision problems dissapeared... After having done this I confronted the entity... Asked why he had put this thing on me... He told me that they did not think I would notice... lol, good answer... I asked how long I had had it on me... and he told me about a year... I don't know if he told me the truth or not... After having told him not to do it again and a very very small exploration I returned to body.
<br>
<br>
I left the bed in full amazment... everything was different! It is like I have moved from 4:3 movie view to widescreen... clearer sight, clearer sound... And like my egos has reduces 10 fold! (egos = negative states, anger, irritation, nervousnes, sadness etc)
<br>
<br>
Whatever this thing was, removing it sure caused a LOT of change. And I am very happy I did not read the replies before this and decided to ignore it... Having removed this thing removed all my vision problems, and I feel great!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I can also add that right after having removed the mask, I went back to body... Felt the entity putting it back onto me, I was relaxed enough to feel his hands attach it onto my head. I was deep enough, exited again... removed it and felt the suite.

<section>
vannostrom,
<br>
That is a very hard question, I have been attacked by many different entities, and it is really nothing to worry about. I do not want you to get discouraged by me mentioning attacks, because it is really nothing to think about.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to these specific spirits... they have "attacked" me in several ways... usually they are more like bullies... For instance several beings can hold onto me laughing etc... This however was a while ago, usually nowadays they are quite nice though, and have even helped me out of body a few times.

<section>
EnderZ,
<br>
Things aren't always as simple as black and white... things aren't either good or bad, there are many levels of grey... This guy is not what one would usually call a "neg", but rather nice most of the time lately. I have learnt quite a bit from him by talking to him... and was unaware of this thing being on me.
<br>
<br>
A good way to describe him is a neutral spirit with moral issues. He did use to attack me a lot in the beginning... however thought we worked it out... He was mad at me using conjurations and I was mad at him for attacking me... I stopped using conjurations and he stopped attacking me... I considered it a communication error, were each party was beliviving the other to be the one doing wrong.
<br>
<br>
If this number of a year is correct, this "thing" was put on me before I knew him. Also since we resolved the attack issues, besides a few exceptions he has only been nice.
<br>

<section>
EnderZ,
<br>
First time I tried to remove it I had about 5 spirits running towards me, not happy... not sure he was one of them... Second time I was stopped by another spirit, again not him...
<br>
<br>
Third time I did remove it, and he was around, I returned to body and felt someone re-attach it... He was the only one I did see around at the time, but not sure it was actually him that put it back on.
<br>
<br>
There are several entities, he is the one I have had most history with, and who I considered a friend... don't know the other ones too well... only spoken briefly to them... One or two seems very cautious when I try to talk to them... not wanting to tell me much at all... while other's are more open and fun...
<br>
<br>
The one I see mostly is the spirit I mentioned... but have spoken to a few other ones as well, who seem to know him... I did see 5 or so other entities, including a kid.
<br>
<br>
They look human, like ordinary people... since that is what they are...

<br>
This is quite complicated, and I don't have it all figured out myself yet, only the very basics. I do see them in the real-time zone, however they do not seem to perceive themselves as being there.
<br>
<br>
Their vibrational frequenzy is in such a way as being in physical, which is probably why they stick around me, I most likely provide the energy they need to stick around here.
<br>
<br>
At the same time however, their vibrational frequenzy is slightly above physical... this makes them visible in the real-time zone... But since they have a vibrational frequenzy that is higher than the physical, they are not themselves part of it.
<br>
<br>
This makes it possible for them to interact with people in the physical who is walking around their houses... While still they have a reality on their own, not part of the actual physical plane, which is an objective (to some extent) reality shared between this group o spirits.
<br>
<br>
This means, they see my bed, and me when sleeping on the bed... however they do not see my apartment... Instead they see the reality they have created and shared between the group. My apartment is a 1 room apartment, while their house has many rooms... In their house a bed exist, which is the bed I am getting up from from their point of view after an OBE.
<br>
<br>
This is really hard to explain...
<br>
<br>
When I become OBE, I can walk around my apartment, I see my apartment and I see the spirits in the real-time zone, and they see me, we can communicate... I can now leave my apartment, walk around the real-time zone... or I can decide to share their reality. To share their reality, I touch them, grab hold of an arm, or put my hands on their shoulders... try and open up...
<br>
<br>
My reality will then change, perhaps my vibrations alter slightly to fit theirs, and my surrounding will change... I am now no longer in my apartment, but in the reality they share and see what they see, the energies being relatively objective (we have compared).
<br>
<br>
Now I perceive myself as being in their house, and I might help to alter their reality by putting in some things on my own... since the reality is now shared between all the spirits in it, we are all responsible for how it looks... If however someone in the real-time zone enters my apartment, he will perceive me and the spirits as being in my apartment, while I perceive us in the house, and the new visitor in this house...
<br>
<br>
Same thing applies to many spirits... you might for instance run into a spirit on the street in the real-time zone, this spirit has commited suicide... It is confused, it thinks it is in it's home, but you perceive him as being on the street... I open up to it's reality... and now perceive myself as being in it's house, which might not even exist any more... and we have a shared reality.
<br>
<br>
I am not fully sure yet exactly how this sharing of realities work... first I thought they were still in the real-time zone only, and just "clouded it over" with their own reality... However some experiences seem to point in the direction that their vibrational frequenzies are slightly higher, but still not enough to make themselves "no" part of the real-time zone... Since beings who has a vibrational frequenzy close to each other, perceive each other... So these experiences seem to point in the direction that they are not quite part of the physical world, but not high enough to be entirely free from it.
<br>
<br>
My bet is that they are not aware that they can go any higher, and think that the only way for them to remain energized is to steal energy from the living. As I said, I don't have all of this figured out yet.
<br>
<br>
As to your question if they are in the "inbetween" stage... Death is a very complicated thing... there are so many places you can end up in, and so much which can happen... These seem to be stuck close to the physical, and I think most people would consider them negative entities...
<br>
<br>
They did use to attack me quite a lot in the beginning... and have had communication with the main spirit, and him mentioning that he was "assigned" to me. They have acted very negative in the past... acting like bullies, trying to scare me etc... While still lately they have been more nice, and friendly... and the main spirit been more as a friend... They do know they are dead, and did not seem to understand how one could not know it when I first asked them.
<br>
<br>
One thing is for sure, the term "negative entities" is a very complicated term, and it is never as easy as good/bad.

wow man what you just wrote blew me away. I've never herd anything like that from anyone, its awsome.  So you can have like friends that are spirits in the astral.
<br>
<br>
Do they understand that your from earth in the physical? or do they just see you as someone who passes by to say high once in awhile lol [since you can only ap for so long.]
<br>
<br>
so can these spirits or entities watch us as we are in the physical? like observe into the physical, or RTZ and watch our daily activity?
<br>
<br>
When you talk about their vibration rate, how can you tell how fast/slow theirs are? can you just feel it?
<br>
<br>
have you ever asked them questions like about god, or higher existences?

They know I am alive physically, and also understand that I can only be out of body for very short times since I have explained that to them.
<br>
<br>
I am not sure if they can see me when walking around physically, however I do think they can... They can however see me when I am asleep on the bed. They all seem to have a very interesting sense of being in no hurry, which I guess is natural, being dead and all

<br>
The vibrational frequenzy is not something you usually feel, but is related to where in the dimensional scale you are. The higher frequenzy the higher up you are. Two beings who have a very similar frequenzy rate can see and communicate with each other, with no problem. It also appears that one can put oneself into a vibrational range slightly higher than the other being, hence becomming invisible for this being, but still oneself remaining close enough to see him. Which is what guides seem to do a lot in order to not scare the projector.
<br>
<br>
I don't think these are the spirits to ask about higher existences, since they themselves do not seem to be aware of there being a better place in the higher levels... They seem to be aware that there are lower levels, and the fact that there indeed are levels... But do not seem to be aware that there are spiritual realms not connected to the physical where they might be better off... or they simply prefere it lower.
<br>
<br>
I did ask the spirit when confronting him about the mask, if it was to prevent me from progresing spiritually upwards, since I had to interpit it as some kind of action against me. He did find it amusing and suprised that I wanted to progress spiritually upwards.
<br>
<br>
&gt;what do you mean? that they dont understand why someone could not
<br>
&gt;realize they where not living?
<br>
<br>
Some spirits do not know they are dead, however when I first were having a descent conversation with these spirits I asked them if they knew it... And one of the spirits almost seemed upset for me asking that... Like it was an insult, as in "why wouldn't we know it!?" kind of thing...
<br>
<br>
&gt;sorry for all the questions, i have so much to learn! I love
<br>
&gt;reading about people's expireances in the astral and rtz.
<br>
<br>
No problem.

Have you explored the higher astral planes yet?  if you have i'd love to hear about it.
<br>
<br>
There are 7 astral planes, with subplanes in each one, but is there something even higher the the 7 planes? As in, do the 7 planes really just compose a sub plane in an even higher level, or state of being?
<br>
<br>
Have you ever tried to show the entites or spirtis the higher levels? like explore with them.
<br>
<br>
also im still curious as to what they look like. you said like people. like regular human behinds? are they in color with different clothes? do they always look the same, with like the same clothes on? and when you first met you and they'd attack you, how would they go about attack you?

<section>
EnderZ,
<br>
I have explored the planes to some smaller extent, however it is not with full control... But more ending up where I end up, sometimes asking to be taken some specific place, or a place I would learn from. The planes are really a VERY VERY huge place, and I don't think you could ever explore a large part of it. You just have to try and visit the places you think you would benefit from, and try to learn as much as possible.
<br>
<br>
According to dimensional theory, and my limited view on it, the 5th dimension consists of 2 planes, the astral and the mental. The astral plane has 7 levels, which also has many sub-levels, as well as the real-time zone, which really should be considered "outside" of this.
<br>
<br>
The mental plane is above the astral plane, above this is the 6th dimension, which also has 2 planes.
<br>
<br>
But this is really only theories until you have experienced it, and confirmed it... regardless how many other people who have experienced it, it still will only be a theory for you.
<br>
<br>
&gt;Have you ever tried to show the entites or spirtis the higher levels? like explore with them.
<br>
<br>
No my navigational skills are still very limited... and I have never wanted to force anything on them. One of the spirits have however once taken me to a lower level, which I believe to have been his home in the upper infra dimensions.
<br>
<br>
&gt;also im still curious as to what they look like. you said like people.
<br>
&gt;like regular human behinds? are they in color with different clothes?
<br>
&gt;do they always look the same, with like the same clothes on? and when you
<br>
&gt;first met you and they'd attack you, how would they go about attack you?
<br>
<br>
These specific beings look human, like any other human... and not really any difference at all seeing them in the astral, and seeing some strangers in a store. A few have however either choosen to not reveal the appearance they had when alive, or they have forgotten it. So a few of them have "taken" the appearance of some people I have known earlier in life. While other spirits have the appearance they had when physically alive (most of them).
<br>
<br>
I have asked them how it comes I perceive them this way, and the main spirit once tried to explain it to me... but I didn't really understand... It is possible that either they have "forgotten" how they look, and I interpit the energies putting a "face" on them. This seem to be true for some spirits, considering I once visited a friend who commited suicide... He did not know he was dead, or even human... I perceived him first as an object, part of the room he was in. I asked if he knew when he was, what he used to be, who he was now, if he knew his name etc etc and he knew nothing of that. As I began to speak to him, making him think, he slowly changed appearance and began to look human...
<br>
<br>
At the end he was looking fully human, however still did not know who he was... hence I interpited his energies, and put a "standard" face on him, a very familiar face.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, in the case of the main spirit it seems he "choosed" this to happen, for me to put a face on him... This is based on me accidentally projected to him, I saw him lay on bed... he asked how I got there... and I asked who he was... He then changed his appearance, and I now perceived him the way I usually perceive him. He changed his appearance from the appearance he had when physically alive, back to the appearance I am used to see him with... so I would recognize him... He told me he had resigned, and that they had sent someone to take his place (which I had met about 3 projections in a row, attacking me).
<br>
<br>
I have also been told by a couple of spirits, that they too experience this interpitation of energies thing... It is however very easy to tell when this happens... it is always a very familiar face.
<br>
<br>
Didn't want to go into this much detail on a public forum, but since you asked I thought I had to give a proper explaination.
<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that not all beings are ex-humans, however it does seem that it usually the ex-human ones who go for a direct attack. The other ones seem to be more accidental. I have for instance twice run into a sort of demon looking like an "imp". These are more annoying than anything, about the height as to my throat, walks with back bent down a little... green, humanoid... Both times I have met such a being, it has bitten my hand when holding on to him.
<br>
<br>
I have also spoken to a friend who has met the same kind of entity, which to him too bit him, lol. They don't seem very smart, seem quite animalistic, grabbed my leg once and pulled me across the floor.
<br>
<br>
There are also darker and more evil ex-human spirits, who often take the form of a black cloud.
<br>
<br>
I hope I did not scare you, you did ask, it is truly nothing to be scared of... It usually sounds worse when reading other peoples experiences than it really is.
<br>
<br>
As for the comment about clothes, I don't know if they wear the same clothes actually... I rarely bother to take that into account when seeing people in the physical... and neither do I when OBE, usually a lot more interesting things to look at than peoples clothes
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
I can however say that I was once accidentally entering the home of this spirit in some kind of reality... talked to him briefly... Was going to go through the window outside... however I did not have pants nor a shirt on at the time... And apparently he thought going outside without it was a bad idea, so handed me pants and a shirt... So I guess they can change clothes if they want to
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
of course I am sure it varies depending on the reality, and the spirits... I was in some kind of city when I walked outside, so he might have more freedom than some other spirits do.

What did it feel like when it bit you? I've herd all sorts of stuff for compating other entities like conjurations, imagining up weapons, or simply just ignoreing them and they will get bored and leave you alone.  As for the me getting scared part, dont worry about that, i've read alot about crazy attacks and such but it doesn't mantter, im very determined to master astral projection, and i wouldn't let a simple emotion stop me.

Sorry, I didn't mean to change this tread away from your original topic. but again, thanks for all of the information you've been giving me, its only fueling my desire to be be able to project.  How long after you had your very first projection where you able to have much more control over it?  and what technieques do you personaly use. Thanks!

Hi Patrick,
<br>
<br>
I have a similar mask, in fact it's thicker it can become a helmet...it's an ectoplasmic spirit mask, basically a spirit is binding you, it requires exorcism, you can self-exorcise...it takes some practice.
<br>
<br>
I have it because witches are sending negs against me and my family.  This neg mask is horrible if it's on children as it hinders them from learning.
<br>
<br>
It means it's either someone sending it after you, or you have been hexed or some spirit is just in you that you have to overcome.  If it's being sent to you by someone else, it'll be tough, otherwise it ought to be quite easy to get rid of once you get the hang of exorcising the spirit.

<section>
kalratri,
<br>
Huh? That didn't sound fun at all... If you have any suggestions on how get rid of this thing, and do this "excorsism" as you call it, I would be more than grateful to hear it. I did remove the mask and the suite, however was put back on after about a day during sleep. I am currently doing everything I can to make the spirits understand I am no longer going to play nice, however the effects are quite limited.
<br>
<br>
The mask hinders children from learning, but not adults? Sounds strange...
<br>
<br>
If you have any suggestions they would be really appreciated, thanks.

There are many ways to fight entities, and some ways are better than other's, also depending on the entities. Conjurations are usually very good for clearly negative ones, but doesn't always work as good for the more neutral ones with moral issues
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
It is hard to explain exactly the sensation one gets by such a thing as being bitten... Basically it feels the same way as when being bitten in the physical, except the actual pain of it. When I return to body after having for instance being bitten in the hand, it feels like my physical hand has been bitten... it does not hurt, but the sensation is there...
<br>
<br>
&gt;Have you ever tried visiting someone who passed away? If so could
<br>
&gt;you have conversations with them, did they remember you?
<br>
<br>
Yes I have, however quite limited... I did try to visit my grandparents, and saw them... but returned to body before having a meaningful conversation.
<br>
<br>
I also, as I mentioned in an earlier post, visited a friend of mine who commited suicide... I was able to talk to him, but he was in a "dreamstate", not knowing who he was, or even aware of being human... I plan to visit him again in a near future, hoping that he has gotten out of it, and into a higher plane.
<br>
<br>
&gt;what about past lives. Have you ever been able to veiw your past lives while oob.
<br>
<br>
Only once.

<br>
<br>
No problem, level of control varies... You always have control since the concious level is equal to the physical, with some exceptions where it sometimes can be more, and sometimes less. However it is quite easy to get distracted... You planning to do something next time you get out, but happen to stumble onto something which strikes your interest, and you entirely forget what it was you wanted to do earlier.
<br>
<br>
Techniques used varies, what technique used is not as important as the mental state, relaxation and level of concentration/focus in my oppinion.

Hi Patrick,
<br>
<br>
Very interesting stuff!  I have a friend that also tells me many more strange and 'out there' things of the astral planes.  She is able to see them and the beings around the clock.  She also is being 'held down' and much worse by certain beings I believe to be some of the most advanced at doing these restrictive things.  I am beginning to get a much broader perpective on this stuff and have learned from her much of these 'negs' master plans.  I have discovered that they mostly don't want people to find out what their up to, especially the ones with potential to stop their 'neg' activities(you must be one who can help put a stop to their shams).  Some of their 'secret' plans include:  taking women out of their bodies while they sleep and 'sexing' them to steal their energies, developing methods to 'feed' off people's higher energies, and generally keeping people in fear or confusion or anger by puting many of these implants or dark thought-form crystals or gadgets.  I can see MAJOR changes in my friend after severe bouts, especially eye color changes when they steal her higher energies, also much more dasterdly deeds.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest you ask this main guy who he was in his past lifes and he just might tell you.
<br>
<br>
I might also be able to answer some questions, as I have learned quite a bit from my friend, who really could use some extra help these days.  I also wonder if you might be able to project to her and see what's happening there.
<br>
<br>
Be well...

<section>
Covelo,
<br>
<br>
I don't think these beings are to be counted as "advanced" really, the more advanced ones don't tend to stick to one person... and are usually much much worse. However that doesn't mean that these kinds are fun, or nice in any way.
<br>
<br>
The beings mentioned here have done similar things to me in the past... pushed me down on the floor after leaving the body... a group holding on to me, while they are laughing and playing etc. This is why I called them "bullies", just trying to scare you, preventing you from doing anything serious. However they don't really do things like this anymore, this was in the beginning before we "worked things out".
<br>
<br>
To your comment about taking women out of their bodies, not quite how it works... When you are asleep, you leave your body, however do not know it. So you lay there on the bed, out of body and the spirits around you can see you... I have woken up a few times by a spirit clanging on to me, in a negative way seeming to want energy transferred to him.
<br>
<br>
Of course I have also been woken up by completely other entities, which are warm loving, and who have even comforted me after a bad dream... and scared spirits, clanging on to me because of being terrified, not knowing they are dead...
<br>
<br>
It is interesting you would mention feeding of peoples higher energies... A theory of mine is that the suit they put on me, and the cable connected to it... Is a way for them to absorb my energies, transferring them through this cable. And that the lack of these energies etc, is a byproduct causing what I described above, a new "world view"... Like a cover has been put above the world, making it "wrong"... However this does start to sound a little too much "Matrix"... however it has to do something...
<br>
<br>
&gt;I would suggest you ask this main guy who he was in his past lifes and he just might tell you
<br>
<br>
I have tried, however he is very secretive on that point... only giving short cryptic answers... He has however said something which indicates he knew my mother when she was young... However too little information to know for sure.
<br>
<br>
&gt;I also wonder if you might be able to project to her and see what's happening there
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately not quite that simple... usually you need to know the person well in order to project to them... A photograph can work sometimes... But usually you need to know and feel their "essence", their personality etc... and that can't be done through a photograph. Also as I noted before, my abilities to project at will to a specific location or person is very limited... Still trying to master this, but not easy when you get interputed by spirits so often...
<br>
<br>
I do suggest she does all she can to get rid of them though... I am currently trying that myself, the effects are very limited... But in one way or the other I am gonna resolve this.

Hmmmmmmmm....
<br>
<br>
I've found if I use my astral hands to pry my eyes open in an OBE that it fixes my blindness problem. I had thought that it worked because it's a way of explicitly giving your intent to open your astral eyes clearly.
<br>
<br>
But now I'm thinking it's because there's some kind of etheric gunk that forms over my eyes and that maybe some kind of spirit is putting it there?
<br>
<br>
I'll have to try cleaning off my entire astral body next time I'm out and see what that does.

cube,
<br>
I have tried several times to force my eyes open using my astral hands, and it does not work... I can at times see a faint light at the bottom, but besides that no... Removing the mask I mentioned does help though.
<br>
<br>
&gt;But now I'm thinking it's because there's some kind of etheric gunk
<br>
&gt;that forms over my eyes and that maybe some kind of spirit is
<br>
&gt;putting it there?
<br>
<br>
Having vision problems is quite a common thing for projectors... I don't think they are all related to having masks on... Most people experience vision problems from time to time... and usually just opening them helps to see again.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if there is any other way to remove it than in the astral... Hopefully there is, but if so, not that I am aware of at the moment. I have currently declared a war against these entities, doing protection rituals all day long, and they are not happy... I have also ordered Robert Bruce's practical self-defence book... Always thought it was a waste buying it, and it would get you paranoid more than anything... But now I think I really need the suggestions in there...

I can't say I have, I think I need a lot more experience before I can even think about such a thing. Ones experiences are also very personal, so if I am to write a book regarding them it would have to be with the intention that oher people could benefit and learn from them, and not just a bunch of stories scaring people telling them about attacks

<section>
I think the most useful thing would be a novel that gets into the underlying motivations everyone has, for instance why neutral spirits misbehave sometimes and how it is they got to be neutral spirits in the first place.
<br>
<br>
Basically a few short character sketches of the life histories of a couple of the spirits you've run across would be fascinating.
<br>
<br>
Most movies today seem to focus on the plot and not the characters, there haven't been any genuinely new plots in the last 100 years but there's an unlimited number of personalities and an unlimited number of ways for people's personalities to interact. So the difference between a good story and a stale story is how interesting the characters are.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't get too hung up on getting the mystical aspects of it 100% right because the vast majority of the people reading it wouldn't really care (it's fiction to them). If you get the characters right then people would enjoy it.

I don't think that is anything I am interested in... I have no interest in writing fiction, or novels... Assuming I in a future did write a book, it would be with the intention of telling my experiences to help other's, and guide them to their own understandings, making it as accurate as possible.

<br>
It might be true that most people would consider it fiction, however there are a small percentage who is truly seeking true experiences, and would appreciate genuine information, and those are the ones to write for.
<br>
<br>
I know myself that it were people who tried to tell things the way it was, telling what they experienced, that inspired me the most in the beginning.

Good luck with that Patrik, hope you figure everything out.
<br>
<br>
How do you know if an entite is around you while you are sleeping [be it bad and tryint to take energy, or just a good one hanging around]?
<br>
<br>
Recently within the past week or two, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night without even realizing it at first. Its kind of like im dreaming, then i guess my only way to explain it is that it shifts from unconscience dreaming, to me in my bed looking up at my celing, thinking about the dream i just had. Its like the next thing I know im thinking with my eyes open about a dream i jsut had. I cant remember how i woke up in the first place, or what just happened a few seconds ago, i just check the time and go back to sleep. Now that i think about it after writing it down, is it possible im having spontainous projections at night? thatd be nice heh =]  I'll have to check next time it happens.  but good luck, I hope you get to the base of this whole mask and suit thing, and when you do, let us know

EnderZ,
<br>
I know if an entity is in bed with me because I can feel it, how it feels depends on the level of relaxation. To take an example, I have/had a non-physical cat that used to sleep with me every night. I would go to bed, lay down, making myself comfortable... I can then feel a cat jumping up into the bed, walking around, making itself comfortable. When this happened in the beginning, I was constantly opening and closing my eyes, feeling that it felt just too real not to be a physical cat.
<br>
<br>
I could then feel it walk over to my back, and lay down against me. When feeling it walk around the bed, it is no difference to a physical cat and the non-physical one. When it however is laying against a body part, it feels physical, just with less "substance". As I get more and more relaxed, the cat starts to feel more and more solid, when at the end when I am just falling asleep it feels fully solid and physical.
<br>
<br>
I have woken up by this cat a few times in the middle of the night, feeling it on my chest, licking me in the face, wanting to cuddle... Since it is walking on my astral body, I am woken up out of body, and can pet it using my astral hands. Lately I have a few times when it was sleeping next to my ear heard it purr, very faint though clearly. I have however not felt or seen it for a couple of weeks now... I had another animal in bed with me a while back a few days, I think this one might have scared it away.
<br>
<br>
This same thing applies to feeling humans sleep next to you. Quite a while back I had a problem with a spirit that wanted to sleep in bed with me. The problem here was that it wanted to be so close to me, that his body was going "through" my physical body. This in itself does not feel nice when wanting to go to sleep... But the real problem was that as I got closer to sleep the spirit next to me felt more and more solid and physical. When I then did hit the sleep boarder and became unconcious, this spirit felt fully solid... And since it occupied the same space as me, it felt as if our bodies were "merged", this was a very uncomforting feeling... which caused my imidiate wakeup... Had a lot of problems sleeping a few days because of it... I eventually just ignored the spirit, pretended it was not there... and it eventually got bored and left.
<br>
<br>
To your comment regarding your wakeups, it is of course possible you wake up split. But it is also possible you just wake up from a dream, being in your physical body and then return to sleep, you can only tell by experimenting. If you wake up, see the actual ceiling, and then suddenly black and you do not see the ceiling any more... it is very likely you were split for a few seconds, too sleepy to realize.
<br>
<br>
Next time this happens, just sit up, don't think about it... just sit up... if you then suddenly find yourself laying down again, you were split and out of body

<section>
yea next time i wake up like that, im gonna see if i can float heh.
<br>
<br>
Feeling these entitys, could you always feel them like this before you started ap'ing, as in where you always sensitive to other nonphysical beings? That is really neat. If i was going to bed and felt someone trying to sleep next to me like that, i'd probably bug out haha.
<br>
<br>
I've herd over and over that when you sleep or dream i think, you really are projected. Is your astral body just right by your physical the whole time? when i've herd that said, I always thought that our astral body was just roaming around the astral planes without awarness. But im guessing to be able to feel entitys like that, then your astral body is in the RTZ next to your body?
<br>
<br>
A few times while in a deep trance, I've felt some feelings around my legs, kind of like the covers on top of me are moving in some way, like if they where being scrunched up over and over again if that makes sense, but just ignored it. Was that just vibrations or do an entity?

EnderZ,
<br>
I suggest not just trying to float out, but actively get out of bed... But if you do try to float, do not just "imagine" floating, make sure you "FEEL" it, feel yourself raising up more and more... Try to get yourself to the point of not feeling the bed any more. Floating up like this can be quite tricky, especially if you want to float away from bed, onto the floor... Tricky thing and not recommended as your main technique to get away from body.
<br>
<br>
No I was never able to feel spirits before I began to practise AP and trance states. It is something that has developed over time... Now I can sit at the computer, and feel the cat jump up on the chair, into my lap
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
This however doesn't mean I can feel all the spirits all the time... If I am standing making dinner, and there is a spirit next to me, looking at me... I wouldn't notice.
<br>
<br>
&gt;I've herd over and over that when you sleep or dream i think, you really are projected. Is your astral body just
<br>
&gt;right by your physical the whole time? when i've herd that said, I always thought that our astral body was just
<br>
&gt;roaming around the astral planes without awarness. But im guessing to be able to feel entitys like that, then your
<br>
&gt;astral body is in the RTZ next to your body?
<br>
<br>
When you are asleep, you are in fact out of body yes, however you do not know it since you are unconcious. If you visit someone who is asleep, you might see then in their bed, close to the physical body... or walking around the apartment, acting silly. Can also happen he is some completely other place, like in another city, or at a friends house. You might have travelled to the friend, and you are both asleep, communicating with each other, both seeing the other in his/her own dreams... Or you might be communicating with a spirit, clouding the appearance by the spirit of subconcious images, thinking he is your friend.
<br>
<br>
I am not quite sure how it works regarding being in the planes and the real-time zone. If you are dreaming, and suddenly realize you are dreaming, hence having a lucid dream. You are now still surrounded by the subconcious images, and the background story of the dream might still be going on... If you now feel your back, you might feel that the silvercord is attached to the body. You can now clear away the subconcious images, and project to any place you like, just like in an OBE (can be tricky to get into the real-time zone, but possible).
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I have experienced being in an unconcious dream, and suddenly a cat jumps on me for no reason in the dream... I then wake up, what I thought was physically... only to realize I was woken up out of body by the non-physical cat, and that was why I created a cat in my dream.
<br>
<br>
It is possible you are using two different bodies, one in the real-time zone, and one in the planes. By having a being shake your astral body in the real-time zone, you are transferred from the body in the planes to the one in the real-time zone... It might also be that you are out in the planes in your astral body, and the cat jumps up on your etheric body... This makes your astral body snap back into the etheric one, your astral body are now inside the etheric body... Realize you are split, and now pet the cat using your astral body, moving the astral body outside the etheric one again.
<br>
<br>
I really know too little on this subject, but it is a really interesting one... and earns some investigation.
<br>
<br>
&gt;A few times while in a deep trance, I've felt some feelings around my legs,
<br>
&gt;kind of like the covers on top of me are moving in some way, like if they
<br>

<br>
<br>
Very hard to know what you mean exactly... it does however not sound like an entity, nor the vibrations... Might just be signs of the trance and relaxation, the numbness making itself more noticable, but can't say for sure. In any case I suggest you ignore it, all physical sensations are distractions when it comes to the split.

i have been dealing with this exact same thing for over a year now. i have heard others talk about this also.with me it is people from here doing it.they can suit me in a full body suit, and download all of my usual "files" onto the suit, so that if i take the suit off (using tactile techniques from the new system), my own body feels empty and drained.the newer body is like drugs, because it is less sensitive, like a barrier to outside world, but spirirtually very draining and damaging.
<br>
one person can make many of these suits for others and it is like a trade,the wearer gets the false confidence of the barrier and the charisma of the person who makes the energy clothing,and the maker of the "clothing" has easy access to your thoughts and perceptions.the maker of the energy "clothes" can just sit as the money rolls in because your defenses are down  and they can just suck your life force. these people are not only very determined, but also very addicted energy vampires and if you take the suit or mask off, they will immediately feel the loss of their "medication"
<br>
i have had limited success in gaining control of my energy. a lot does happen when i am sleeping and cant yet protect myself. i have found that all psychic control requires constant reaffirmation. controlling your spirit does not work on inertia.and psychic control comes down mainly to two basic factors:mental intimidation and guilt scenarios and triggers (often implanted in dreams) and impulse manipulations. self control and discipline is one of the best tools to avoid someones psychic aggression.another tool is self knowledge-KNOW YOUR OWN SOUND. i constantly check my own voice to make sure it is my sound.i have found that if i am in doubt, it is an energy to dispose of.but owning my space is a moment to moment battle and very stressfull.
