I have read and truely believe it is very important to protect yourself before you try (and succeed with) an OBE.  I usually say a prayer to God then ask to be surrounded and protected by His white light.  While I'm visualizing this white light completely surrounding me like a heavy fog, I state that "In this light there is Divine protection and only God and good can penetrate this light".
<br>
<br>
What other means of protection do people do before an OBE?
<br>
<br>

Hi Don,
<br>
<br>
I personally feel no need whatsoever to protect myself before an OBE, despite hearing tons and tons of people saying you must do it, I simply do not take that to me - I guess I listen more to my instincts or "inner voice".
<br>
But if you truly think it is very important to shield yourself then it is wise to do so I think.
<br>
If not, you would probably not feel as safe, and we all know fear is our greatest obstacle for growth and whatever acchievements we want to acchieve. Since I feel - for me - there is no need to protect myself in the sence of doing some ritual or say a prayer, I can´t answer you what other means of protection people engage in, it has never interrested me.
<br>
But if it makes you feel safer doing it, then I suggest you practice some form of "protection" !!
<br>
Search the web and you´ll certainly find some ideas, as well from the people who´ll answer you here soon.....   right guys??

I do not do any kind of ritual for protection. Sometimes I will say a little prayer for protection and help in projecting. I do have a practice, per say, that I use to help protect me. From what I have read and experienced I believe that the only thing that can hurt you is your own fears. So I practice not being afraid and remaining in control of my emotions. I do this all the time on the physcal plane to train myself to be more in control on the astral. If one cannot control their fears on the physical then they do not have much of a chance of doing so on the astral. Also I try to push away all negative feelings that I have, especially before I project. In a way this is exactly what you are doing only in a different way. It seems to me that by your method you are comforted, feel safe so that fear will not over take you, and push away the negative. I think that as long as you can do these things then it does not matter how you do them as long as you can do it. So whatever works for you then use it.

I've posted on this before so you'll get more info from digging out some of my previous posts. Basically, what you have to realise is what we call "thought" is, in fact, a primary form of energy. We don't notice it all that much on the Physical because our physical bodies and associated actions "buffer" our thought processes.
<br>
<br>
On the Physical we can basically think what we like. However, in order for things to actually happen, we have to physically *act* on our thoughts. In other words, you can
<i>
 think
</i>
about having a beer. But unless you physically get off the sofa, go to the fridge and get one... nothing is going to happen.
<br>
<br>
Realise that, on the Astral, there is no such physical buffer. Hence, as you "feel" so it instantly becomes. Big problem is, "thought-fuelled fear" comes about
<u>
 ever so readily
</u>
on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The moment you become a little fearful, your circumstances will instantly change in order to justify whatever level of fear you are experiencing. This is because *your* emotion provides the energy to create the new emotion-fuelled surroundings. Remember, on the Astral there is no Physical buffer between your thought-release-emotion and the circumstances that surround you.
<br>
<br>
On the Physical, you
<u>
 can
</u>
get a little enraged and think about biffing someone on the nose. But "thinking" about it and actually "doing" it are two entirely different things on the Physical.
<u>
 But that is not so on the Astral
</u>
. As your mind releases the emotional-fuel, so your Astral surroundings and/or circumstances become.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, people get tricked into thinking it's the other way around. In the sense they think they became fearful because they just had a scary Astral circumstance thrown at them... no... the nasty circumstance came about because they felt fearful. The change in circumstances is instant. Making it ever so tricky to make sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
The "protection" you are serving up for yourself is all very well, in theory.
<br>
<br>
What you are saying can work. For if you "believe" that you are protected by some kind of "shield" such that no harm whatsoever can possibly come to you, then great. Once you are within the Astral, therefore, you should never "fear" anything because you firmly believe you are protected. As a result, you will never give out any fear-based emotional fuel... in turn... no fearful circumstances will ever be generated.
<br>
<br>
However, from your point of view, you will believe that no nasty Astral circumstances have ever come about - in your case - because your "shield" is working keeping them out. When, in fact, it is your
<u>
 belief
</u>
that the "shield" is working that is keeping your own potentially fearful emotion(s) in check.
<br>
<br>
If your belief in this "shield" is what works for you then all well and good. But realise there is a danger in thinking this way.
<br>
<br>
It is all very well thinking about shields, and so forth, before the Astral event. But the circumstances that can (and do!) come about on the Astral can
<u>
 so very easily
</u>
take your normally earth-bound sense of conscious awareness *totally* by surprise. Not because of Demons or anything. But simply because often, on the Astral, what you see can be
<u>
 so very different
</u>
to what your sense of conciousness awareness is used to seeing on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
You WILL have scary moments, believe me.
<br>
<br>
When it happens, with me, I can now recognise the resulting changes in scenery for what they are: my very own thought-fuelled emotions being played out, all around me, in glorious 3D Technicolour. As such, more often than not, I can regain control of my thoughts and simply let the emotional energy dissipate. But it's tricky. This is something that took me around 5-years to realise, initially, and now - even after hundreds of Astral experiences - I STILL can get caught out.
<br>
<br>
The danger is, with yourself, you will fail to recognise the true picture.
<br>
<br>
As such, when you have a scary moment, you will come to believe that your "shield" is not working. Or maybe that God (the entity whom you believe granted you this "shield" in the first place) no-longer loves you, or is not listening to you, or whatever. So you might scour the Internet in a search for a stronger, more powerful shield. Yet these "scary moments" I say WILL continue regardless of what you do...
<i>
 for they are simply a
 <u>
  natural consequence
 </u>
 of the process of projection into the Astral.
</i>
<br>
<br>
After a while, you may begin to feel "possessed" and you might start talking to others who have gone down a similar path to yourself (there are plenty of them). Or you might conclude that these "possessions" are a result of some "evil deed" you did in a "past life" (there are plenty of those too).
<br>
<br>
Obviously, I realise what you choose to do is your own affair. But I would strongly suggest you consider this matter very carefully and try to realise the true picture.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I'd recommend creating a durable long lasting all purpose psychic shield.  And, at least for me, having Akna'advae trying to rip through my barriers was quite real and definitely NOT something I imagined because I was 'scared'.  Frank, does make a good point though, we literally create our paradises and hell, but ...attack from outside forces is something altogether...not everything is in your mind.  Haha.  Or maybe it is, I don't know.

<br>
<br>
Your case and point is a typical experience that I'd guess virtually everyone comes across sooner or later... once they begin projecting their sense of consiousness into the Astral realms.
<br>
<br>
Understand that what I am talking about has nothing to do with "imagination". The ability to imagine is a Physical-plane activity the like of which is simply not possible on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Imagination is possible on the Physical because our bodies act as a major buffer to our thoughts. Which means we can think about doing some action, and get all emotional over it, but not actually
<u>
 do
</u>
it. In other words we say we "imagined" doing it.
<br>
<br>
However, on the Astral, there is NO such Physical buffer. As you imagine, so it INSTANTLY becomes in glorious 3D Technicolour.
<br>
<br>
Big problem being, when projecting, you do NOT just suddenly develop a super sense of Astral conscious awareness. The senses you take with you are the same as you have on the physical. Which is a MAJOR stumbling block; as all your thoughts, fears, desires, beliefs, etc., etc. come to the Astral with you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I am new here and I was reading through the posts, and I was wondering:
<br>
Tir13, what is Akna'advae ?

Hello,
<br>
<br>
I've never had the notion of needing protection. After getting over the initial fear, which happens with the first OBE experiences, it has always been quite calm and peaceful. I don't have things lurking about, waiting to pounce on me the moment I project.  I guess getting over the fear, and becoming confident and trusting with the experience, could give you all the protection you need.

<section>
Most of the people's books that I'm reading now on Astral Projection do
<i>
 not
</i>
use any form of protection, but do not advise against it either if it gives the OBE'er greater confidence.
<br>
<br>

 A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or else what's Heaven for?

Frank, I thought I should just let you know that I always find your comments incredibly insightful and interesting.
<br>
<br>
They are extremely useful for the novice projector and I figured everyone deserves a little praise, yourself most definetly included
