<section>
Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
Here's what I've learned to do regarding phasing or focusing my attention away from the physical and into the nonphysical, to explore the afterlife. From what I've been able to determine, we can use whatever methods seem to resonate with us...but I have discovered that becoming acquainted with and *feeling*  the stages we use to  get into the afterlife can be important. Also, paying attention to what we're *feeling* while in the afterlife, using the nonphysical senses, is just as important. In the beginning of exploring I subscribed to the, "if I can't see it I don't believe it" idea,  and my progress was slow. But this is how we learn: by just doing it, going there, learning first hand.
<br>
<br>
I started in the late 80's with the TMI Gateway tapes and used those methods (but at that time I thought I had to go OOB to explore) but discovered two years ago that Bruce Moen's simple techniques worked much better for me. I spend less time now preparing to go into the afterlife and get much better results while there, including many afterlife experiences wherein I was able to get verifiable info to really prove to myself that all this was very real ( I was a major skeptic til I got irrefutible proof that even I couldn't somehow rationalize away!---LOL!).
<br>
<br>
There are 4 basic steps I use to focus attention away from the physical to explore within. **And just a quick note here to Focus 15---when you attend Bruce's workshop soon he'll not only explain these steps  (plus additional techniques) but guide you and the small group into them, several times as you experience afterlife journeys. I'm just a student of his and believe me, he's the teacher and a good one. What I'm describing here is a brief overview---at the workshop you'll get a much more in-depth idea and feel from him on these steps.**
<br>
<br>
Step 1--Breathing for relaxation
<br>
Step2--Energy Boost
<br>
Step3-- Filling with love for better perception
<br>
Step4--Placing Intent
<br>
<br>
Step1---Sitting in a chair or lying down, I close my eyes and begin to gently breath in (let your inhale be normal) and as I feel my lungs fill I then gently roll that inhale into a gentle exhale (once again just exhale normally--no forceful breathing, just let each inhale flow into an exhale and gently loop back again). I do this 3 times or as many times as needed so that when I FEEL myself relax (which is a slight phasing or shift of attention in itself) I then can move on to the next step.
<br>
<br>
Step 2---In this relaxed state, see  with your mind's eye or feel a large pool of sparkling clean energy below you. As you begin to gently inhale, breathe in and see this energy enter your feet and travel up through your body and out the top of your head...and then see this energy curve out and down back to the pool below. Repeat this 3 times, cycling the energy back up through you and back down to the pool,  or as many times as you want. Now see a large pool or body of sparkling energy above you. At the top of your head locate or feel  a spot, perhaps where the center may be...and then as you inhale, breathe in and see this energy enter that spot and travel down your body, exiting your feet...arcing back up to the pool above. Repeat this 3 times or as many times as you feel is good for you.  When I do this I choose to see the cycling energy as something similar to what fireworks sparklers look like when used at night. This is just my preference. What's important is what this does for us regarding gathering energy: it's a great boost. You may want to pay attention to what this feels like too.
<br>
<br>
Step 3--I know there's been a lot of misunderstanding regarding the use of 'love' in afterlife exploration. I for one, years ago, literally got tired of the word because it was over used, misused perhaps. When Bruce talks about PUL, pure unconditional love, he's not saying to get emotional, sappy or sexual...and especially, he's not talking about intellectualizing it, or seeing love as a concept. Experiencing emotions or other feelings can be the results OF accessing this energy. Bruce  learned in the afterlife that unconditional love is a real energy/consciousness...quite possibly the energy/consciousness that we not only come from, but it's what we are, now. Being the kind of explorer that has to prove to herself through direct experiencing what is real or not,  I have accessed this energy many times, not only to improve my perception for exploring, but to help others while There and even in my conscious physical daily life...and it's impossible to explain the experiencing of it: it's something that has to be directly experienced to KNOW what it really is. While in the afterlife I have unexpectedly been on the receiving end of this energy and it was without a doubt the most incredible knowing/feeling I've ever experienced.
<br>
How to access it is not difficult. This energy/consciousness is not exclusive: it does not belong to the 'spiritually advanced'...it belongs to all of us. And once again, FEELING it is the key.
<br>
Remember a time when you either felt love for someone or something, or a time when you felt loved by someone. Feel that love and hold it within you, let it build as you recall more moments or people you've loved or been loved by. Bruce recalls the love he felt for his newborn babies when he held them for the first time in the hospital. I always bring to me the love I have for my husband and two chihuahuas, as well as the love I felt from my mother. Whatever works for you---just FEEL  this love and let it build up and remain within you.  I could go on and on about the numerous benefits from accessing this energy, especially for afterlife retrieving and exploration, but it's something each preson has to experience, to understand.
<br>
<br>
Step 4-- When I was using the TMI Gateway tapes over 13 years ago, if I had known then what I know now about the placing of intent, I never would have spent so many hours hanging out in that inner 3D blackness--while using a tape---waiting for something to happen. I would get to a focus level and then just wait for someone or something to happen, having no idea that all I had to do was mentally state my desire---where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do. Now I know that placing intent is a simple thing to do. Actually we do it constantly and really never give it much thought.
<br>
What Bruce calls, The Little Finger Exercise: this is where I am now going to FEEL that place within where we actually place the intent for anything. I use this everytime I want to place the intent to explore because it works. As I remain relaxed, knowing I'm going to move, say, my index finger in a few seconds, as I approach that moment of actually moving my finger I first just feel and become acquainted with that area within where we make things happen. Some people 'see' color or perhaps an image, some just feel that inner place. At Bruce's workshop I 'saw' a soft orange color (why I don't know)...but most importantly, I became acquainted with what that area of consciousness *felt like*. And when you're there, move your finger. And then do it again but instead of moving your finger, place your intent (desire) on where you want to go in the afterlife, who you want to meet, etc.  I must say here that I don't feel I'm explaining this step well....but I hope you guys can get the drift. There are times in the afterlife when I just relax and send out a mental statement.....place my intent. I hope I'm not making it seem more difficult than it actually is. I think Frank has a good handle on intent---perhaps he can explain this better.
<br>
<br>
So this is pretty much what I do each time I want to Phase or Focus My Attention and move into the nonphysical.  There are a few more techniques I learned, such as Heart Intelligence, but this is probably enough.
<br>
<br>
My Focus 27 special place:
<br>
Two years ago while reading Bruce's first book, he descibed creating his own special place in F27. Since I was so anxious to get going with exploration (and especially since I discovered through his books that anyone could visit all the focus levels at anytime, and that OOBEs were cool but completely unnecessary to explore and retrieve), I decided that if he could create his own place, so could I. Once placing the intent to go to F27, I was then in that 3D blackness,  just floating.  I decided to *trust* that my intent was the key in getting me there, to F27. I then borrowed the image of a city park I had loved as a child, complete with pond, trees, a park bench, grass, sunshine....and just 'saw it there' in front of me. I then walked into it. I sat on the bench and felt the wooden slats on my butt. I felt the soft moist earth and grass between my toes. I looked at the sun twinkling between leaves and branches above. I sat and looked at the water, and then decided on what flowers I wanted and where. I played with different kinds, on that first visit as well as later. All I had to do to return to my park was to just place the intent to be there (and it really helps to recall the feel of the place  too---this is another Bruce technique but I don't want to overload here). Thought, intent.. creates matter and all dimensions, physical and nonphysical.
<br>
<br>
All righty then...it's late and I hope I've been able to explain well enough. Sorry for the screwed up replies to the wonderful posts from you guys. What can I say?---I'm a certified computer dummie!----:O)
<br>
<br>
Much love and happy trails,
<br>
<br>

Greetings Ginny!
<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for your excellent account of phasing!

<br>
It really is most useful.
<br>
<br>
I hope people can see a pettern forming here when they compare your experiences with those of Frank and others, it is extremely clear that
<b>
 <font size="4">
  imagination
 </font>
</b>
is the key that unlocks the door to full Astral interaction! This is also clear in reading through the TMI information.
<br>
<br>
It is also clear that phasing provides for the possibility of much more rewarding and enduring experiences than classic OBE.
<br>
<br>
Creating a scenario by means of the imagination  - which is very much a spiritual faculty - invokes its Astral counterpart like a lock and key. This can be a self-created scenario, or it could be a known gateway symbol to another realm. All that is required is a necessary pre-phasing procedure.
<br>
<br>
Ginny: could I ask you - what is your level of perception like in the Astral while you are there? Is it a real 3D, full colour, holographic "I am here" type experience, or is it more vague than that. I take it that there is no doubt anyway.
<br>
<br>
How vivid and active does your imagination need to be to trigger the Astral projection? Does it have to be very clear. I know this is a concern to some people, because powers of creative imagination do vary.
<br>
<br>
How do you contact your guide and/or helpers and get involved with retrievals once you have arrived at your Astral place?
<br>
<br>
I am locking this topic in place for ongoing discussions.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

Hi Ginny,
<br>
Wow, this is cool. This is the first time I have heard of anyone else creating a place for themselves in the ethers. Mine is an area created as a visitation place for all who wish to use it for meditation and visits during the day. I also have a private home there.
<br>
There are woods with paths, a large field of wildflowers with butterflies (I often take my pup there to play), an area with trickling waterfall and perpetual rainbow, and large flat rocks to lay on around a quiet pool below the waterfall. The house has a large formal garden in the back with fruit and vegetables plants and my loved roses. There is much more there as well.
<br>
All anyone has to do to visit, is place their intent to go, you are welcome. Others are often there when I visit. A favorite place is a bench I;ve placed beside a shallow stream looking toward the field of flowers, there is a large tree shading this bench. Enjoy your visit.
<br>
Thank you again Ginny, for your confirmation that others are doing this.
<br>

Greetings Donna!
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much for sharing this with us! it is a lovely place you have there!
<br>
<br>
If people wish to visit, on what do they focus their intention exactly? I.e. building an image as you described, or something like "please take me to Donna's place in the country"

<br>
<br>
I would once again like to thank you all for your contributions - we are certainly achieving alot in this new forum on the progressive method of phasing, and I am sure we can build upon this in the future.
<br>
<br>
Donna: I think you mentioned before that you do not use imagination as such, but rather wait for your tunnel to appear, which takes about 20 minutes?
<br>
<br>
I would also like to ask Ginny and Donna whether they are totally absorbed in the Astral to the extent that there is no awareness of the physical body, and if so, whether this happens before or after the Astral entrance?
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again.

  Hi Adrian,
  <br>
  Wherever you direct your intent is where your conciouness will follow. Imagination is a very important spiritual tool, as this is often necessary to direct our conciousness (and subconcious) to achieve our intent. If you can imagine a destination, you can achieve it, no "roadmaps" are necessary. If your intent is to create your own place, that is what you will achieve. It will be as real to you as where you are in physicality. If your intent is to visit my place then, with the description given, your subconcious should take you there for all knowledge of planes, subplanes, universes, and dimensions lie within us and are accessable with simply stating "intent" or picturing in our minds our destination. This is often why a picture of a given destination will help.

   <br>
   <br>
   <hr/>
   <br>
   After about 20 minutes the very helpful natural chemicals released by the human brain help to attain a "body asleep, mind awake" state of being when using the phasing method. Intent is achieved at that point in combination with imagination (picturing), and, or mentally stating a destination by name.
   <br>

   <br>
   <br>
   I would also like to ask Ginny and Donna whether they are totally absorbed in the Astral to the extent that there is no awareness of the physical body, and if so, whether this happens before or after the Astral entrance?
   <br>
   <br>
   <hr/>
   <br>
   <br>
   Using the method of phasing, body asleep-mind awake, I-all of me, is there. Objects and people are firm and tangible, I have no notice of my "other" body left behind, at home, sitting in the chair. Note that this for me is not a sudden transiiton, but gradual, as I go deeper within myself in meditation I lose awareness of the corporal body.
   <br>

Hi to all of you,
<br>
<br>
Short intro.... Ginny is my dear friend, from the first day since almost 2 years ago i find her post on the overly religious after-death site, and sent  her e mail, recommending to visit Bruce Moen site, where I was a member  and a workshop participient then about 8 months. The result is obviously reflected in her posts.
<br>
<br>
I'm also using the very same method for explorations as Ginny does. I never had conscious OOBE, only spontanious, and honestly I have no desire to learn when a much more simpler and controlled exploration, contact is available.
<br>
<br>
If may I add a comment to creating the "special" place in F27 have one more great advantage. I believe there is
<b>
 no exception
</b>
everyone have a doubt they own experiences validity and all of us looking for the knowing for sure.
<br>
<br>
After awhile, in are special place noticing some changes, feeling of some entities/Helpers presence you might wonder "is this place really exist? did I make it up with my mind?...
<br>
<br>
Well there is a wonderful way to verify it..
<b>
 partnered exploration
</b>
<br>
Ginny and I decided to do some experiment.
<br>
<br>
She described to me her F27 place and I did with mine. We agreed to place one item somewhere in each other place with the intention to find it and describe it.
<br>
<br>
Took i would say about the month to find it, describe it, and experience with the how we  interpret the item and what excatly we percived. The end result was incredebly correct down to a color.
<br>
Needless to say we had to add more to the
<b>
 knowing beyond the doubt
</b>
<br>
<br>
That's all for now, looking for many prospective discussion in this fine section of the board.
<br>
<br>
Love to everyone..
<br>
<br>

**********Yep. We've all been raised with the idea that imagination is 'fantasy'...that it has no validity in the world of facts and concrete whatever. The best description I've heard to date regarding the difference between the two is....'imagination is this incredible, innate gift we're each born with, and since we know virtually nothing about it we end up using only a tiny fraction of it to 'fantasize'. In other words, fantasizing is a result OF using imagination.  There is just a limitless amount of things we can do with imagination, fantasizing being only one. Bruce Moen teaches that, say, in the beginning of learning to explore, if you want, go ahead and just *pretend* you're having a conversation with a deceased loved one in your mind or in the afterlife: pretend the conversation back and forth, pretend the environment....and watch for anything unexpected to happen, such as your loved one saying something that isn't in your own 'pretend script'...or they do something unexpectedly, suggest the two of you go somewhere. It's then you begin to realize that somewhere along the line, something real developed. This is using imagination to 'prime the pump', as Bruce says. It happened to me, big time!*******************

***************Well you've got my yes vote on that one. I must have read Bob Monroe's books ten times each through the years, and I not only had great respect for him and what he did for all of us, I just flat out loved the guy. What a big heart he had (has). And yet, Adrian, I knew I never wanted to spend years, as he did, figuring out how the subconscious can literally 'take us for a wild ride' in OOBEs. Perhaps others have a different take on this, but I've had many OOBEs and I just could never control them. It seemed to me all the beliefs and fears and silly movies and junk tucked away in my brain were unleashed during OOBEs.....and who needs that??---LOL!  With Phasing or Focusing Attention Within I have control through the placing of intent. **************************************

*************In the beginning I was in the frame of mind that I had to 'see as we see in the physical', while in the afterlife, in order to believe it was real. Creating my special F27 place really helped me to perhaps strengthen my mind's eye so that I saw color and objects moreso while There.....but for the most part, I do not see in 3D while There. For me it just isn't necessary. I choose to FEEL while There....pay attention to rotes that come to me from Helpers or even nonhuman entities. Usually I can ask for and get images (sometimes fuzzy, other times in color and real looking, as well as fleeting impressions)  just like images we 'see' in the mind's eye, but I seem to need this less and less. And one has no doubt, especially when we're able to get info from a deceased relative or friend---info we had no way of knowing beforehand---that we can then verify through still-in-the-physical living folks.**********************************

*****************Guess what? If I understand you correctly, Adrian, the way I see it, being able to 'see' with the mind's eye doesn't trigger being able to be there in the afterlife, within. Intent does it. 'Seeing' throught the mind's eye can be an aid in helping one become oriented while There, or perhaps helps one to become acquainted with being There and building trust to further explore. When I want to, say, visit F27...I don't see that place vividly in my mind ahead of time (I can if I want, if that helps). All I have to do is place the intent to be in F27. If I've never been there, just place the intent and go. If I've already been to Frank's library, I can use that image but I must *place intent* to actually get there. And by the way, in the afterlife we all perceive a little differently anyway. Frank's library may appear to me as a 1960's high school type of building and interior, while his perception of it  may differ a lot. It doesn't matter because info gathered from that library and comparing that info later is what helps us know it's a very real place (partnered exploring). Bruce Moen rarely has physical-like images while in the afterlife. He learned that perceiving with nonphysical senses was  the language There. The retrieval I posted here of the Confederate soldier?-----This was not like being in a movie with 3D physical likeness all around. I had fleeting glimpses of him sitting under a tree, of a field beyond with trees and fencing. What I locked into was what I felt from that individual...and what Helpers were sharing with me ('knowing feelings', thoughts, impressions, sensing, rotes), prior to getting the guy to simply become aware of the fact that he could leave.*****************************

What I've also been learning is that Helpers, especially our own Guides, are just a thought away anyway. They're right Here, with us, as is all life physical and nonphysical. It's really cool to sit quietly in one's special F27 place... and place the intent for a Guide or Helper to appear---even if you just want to have a chat and ask cosmic questions, ask for help in perceiving the nonphysical better, or assist in retrievals.**************

  Hi Ginny,

  Wow, this is cool. This is the first time I have heard of anyone else creating a place for themselves in the ethers. Mine is an area created as a visitation place for all who wish to use it for meditation and visits during the day. I also have a private home there.
  <br>
  There are woods with paths, a large field of wildflowers with butterflies (I often take my pup there to play), an area with trickling waterfall and perpetual rainbow, and large flat rocks to lay on around a quiet pool below the waterfall. The house has a large formal garden in the back with fruit and vegetables plants and my loved roses. There is much more there as well.
  <br>
  All anyone has to do to visit, is place their intent to go, you are welcome. Others are often there when I visit. A favorite place is a bench I;ve placed beside a shallow stream looking toward the field of flowers, there is a large tree shading this bench. Enjoy your visit.
  <br>
  Thank you again Ginny, for your confirmation that others are doing this.
  <br>

Hi Donna,
<br>
<br>
Oh this sounds like a wonderful place to visit. There's something so peaceful, so centered, about sitting near water...under a great tree, in a place we know is ours. You know what is really fascinating? Early on I decided I'd share my place with animals--any that wanted to graze, nest, scramble...whatever. And wow...each time I'd return there was more life happening there--even the little white seedlings that certain trees send forth in the breeze. It now seems to not only be a nice place to energize or relax, but it's become a sanctuary for the critters-------:O)
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your kind thoughts, Donna, and much love,

  Bruce Moen teaches that, say, in the beginning of learning to explore, if you want, go ahead and just *pretend* you're having a conversation with a deceased loved one in your mind or in the afterlife: pretend the conversation back and forth, pretend the environment....and watch for anything unexpected to happen, such as your loved one saying something that isn't in your own 'pretend script'...or they do something unexpectedly, suggest the two of you go somewhere. It's then you begin to realize that somewhere along the line, something real developed.

Hi Ginny,
<br>
Wow!
<br>
I am really appreciating your descriptions and answers to the questions people are posing to you.
<br>
<br>
Big welcome to you also Dora. It is great to have you here. I have to admit I have begun spending lots of time on Bruce's site filling in as much of the background information as I can. I'm planning to get his books this week and am seriously considering the possibility of also attending his workshop this February in Seattle. It would be very cool to meet you there Focus 15!
<br>
<br>
I have the opportunity to spend about an hour each day having a siesta. I am visualizing that this would be a wonderful time to spend doing retrievals and for creating a personal space in Focus 27. From a practical standpoint I am curious how long you typically spend at a time when you phase into non-physical reality? Is this something you do at any particular time of day/night?
<br>
<br>
Adrian - I have a great deal of gratitude and appreciation for you and your insight into Phasing and the possibilities that it holds for the future. I have a vision that Phasing may be something that people in all walks of life are able to begin to understand and experience - and that is truly awesome. I think once that happens the world will begin to change very very quickly for the good of all!
<br>
<br>
Frank - I haven't written to you in the past but you are my inspiration. Thank you for your open-ness. I am continually amazed at your insightfulness.  When I log into the Forum, I often just do a Search For: *blank space* with Search By Member: Frank. It brings up every topic you have written (that has a space in it). Just thought I would mention that in case others might want to do the same thing - it works great! I use it to keep track of what topics Robert Bruce has been contributing to lately also.
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>
Veo

<br>
<br>
Each particular focus level (or Astral plane in more mystical terminology) resonates with a particular frequency of energy.
<br>
<br>
As you reach Focus 27 you notice that the energy has a much finer vibrational quality. Thought equals direct action on all the mental focus planes. However, on the lower planes the energy has a rather crude kind of quality about it. Mental constructs can be created instantly and easily, but the Astral form quickly dissipates once the thought-energy creating that form is used up.
<br>
<br>
At the Focus 27 stage, however, the energy has a much finer quality. Which means a mental construct remains until you choose to erase it. That is how it is possible to revisit your created place time and again. Plus, you can add to it, or you can delete bits your bored with. At the moment I only have a small beach house but, as I mentioned a while ago, I'm looking to create a kind of oceanside hotel and nightclub complex where people can meet and have some fun.
<br>
<br>
The idea of creating your place, as it were, within F27 is it becomes a place of sanctuary for you following physical death. So many people die without having any real idea of what happens. As a result, they become trapped within the lower regions. And even if they do get rescued, there is no saying that the moment you are brought to F27 your difficulties are suddenly over. (It can take a long time for someone to feel mentally at ease again.)
<br>
<br>
Having already established a home within F27 offers you several distinct advantages. Perhaps the main one being the fact that the trauma many people suffer following physical-body death is eased considerably. As, rather than finding yourself in a kind of mental no-man's-land, following physical-body death you arrive at your very own place which is obviously totally familiar to you. Plus, the fear most people feel, even just thinking about dying, is no longer.
<br>
<br>
Focus 27 exploration is still fairly new to me as my obe practice, overall, has followed basically the Monroe route in that I spent well over a decade trying to fathom it all out on my own. But already, even from my somewhat limited interaction with F27 residents, I'm noticing what a completely different atmosphere the place has. Everyone I've talked to says how great it is to be There and how much they are enjoying life. Which is such a contrast to all the gore and the horror of the lower regions.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

  <br>
  <br>
  *****************Veo, if you go to Bruce's workshop I can tell you right now you'll come away with every tool and technique you'll ever need to help others and explore the many places in the afterlife.  Each workshop is small, roughly 9-12 people sitting with Bruce, discussing, laughing and *exploring and retrieving* first-hand.  It was without a doubt one of the best decisions I ever made. ****************
  <br>
  ************************************
  <br>
  <br>
  I have the opportunity to spend about an hour each day having a siesta. I am visualizing that this would be a wonderful time to spend doing retrievals and for creating a personal space in Focus 27. From a practical standpoint I am curious how long you typically spend at a time when you phase into non-physical reality? Is this something you do at any particular time of day/night?
  <br>
  <br>
  *******************Well, each to their own. I prefer doing it when I am refreshed, not tired. Because I'm self-employed I can decide during the day when I just want to explore or retrieve (usually mid-morning is good for me..or afternoon, but it's whatever works with each individual). Sounds as if you have a wonderful opportunity for the same, Veo!  Although there have been times when after getting into bed, from putting in a long day, I've been able to do a retrieval...but usually I perfer when I'm not sleepy. The last time I did a retrieval while feeling tired and preparing to go to sleep, the Helper had to patiently wait while my focus of attention kept fading in and out---LOL! She was understanding to say the least. When I finally mustered up enough attention to be present there in the retrieval situation, and we then got the person out of their isolation....I sent the Helper a fuzzy, "Sorry"....and as I felt myself leaving the scene I got back an unmistakable feeling of mirth. Helpers are such cool people to work with, learn from.
  <br>
  And, I have been in retrievals that have lasted just a few minutes to a good 30-45 minutes...just depends on where you go etc. Retrievals within the BST (belief system territories) at times can take a little longer, but not always. I have been in the afterlife for over an hour when I started exploring beyond F27.
  <br>
  Veo---do you feel a kind of calling to be of service There, retrievals?
  <br>
  Thanks Veo, nice talking with you....much love....Ginny*************

  <br>
  <br>
  Hi Jacara,
  <br>
  <br>
  I hear where you're coming from.
  <br>
  After I had been to my F27 place several times (in the beginning of exploring)and was just hanging out there one day, I saw someone approaching...and there was no need to see the person's face as I got an unmistakable knowing that it was my Mom (she died in 1979). Well the 'reunion' was very emotional for me, I had lots to say and ask, but the entire time this was happening there was a part of me thinking, "Yea right! This is just my wishful thinking fantasy trip here!" But I remembered what Bruce had said in his books: just play along, see what happens. So I did. When she finally asked me to accompany her somewhere I froze and became very confused: that had not been in my mind at all----I mean, go where? But once again I just went with it. I figured, why not? What did I have to lose? And from there she guided me through my first retrieval and life changed for me in the most profoundly wonderful way.
  <br>
  So I guess what I'm thinking here is, invite a deceased loved one, or a Helper or Guide to your special place...and see what happens? It's the often subtle, unexpected things that are said or done that we want to watch for. Or start with retrievals: they're a great way to learn and grow and get beyond doubts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks for your thoughts, Jacara, and much love....Ginny

Thank you for a warm welcome.

You won't be dissapointed for reading Bruce books, before I decided 2 years ago to read his books, I was a lurker on his board, reading, listen into his chat, and try to find something what I could be skeptical.. LOL...
<br>
But when I heard him to say "don't believe me, believe your ownexperiences, i give you the tool, the rest is up to you" convenced me that is the way for me to go.
<br>
Attending in his workshop was one of the best thing I did.

Looking forward to reading your own experiences.

  Hi Adrian,
  <br>
  <br>
  Sorry I missed this earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  For me my attention is, I'd say, maybe 90-95% in the nonphysical while exploring or retrieving, but if my dogs start barking or I get an itch, my attention can be instantly within the physical...at which point I often have both 'places' in my awareness simultaneously. I can then go either way: back into the afterlife situation before the interruption or return to full waking consciousness.
  <br>
  <br>
  This forum is a terrific place to read, learn and share. Thanks, Adrian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much love,
  <br>

Soulfire-
<br>
Thanks for shooting this up to the top. I hadn't read it till now. And actually, its pretty ironic to me. The first time I tried phasing, I had never done anything like it. I didn't know what any of these F or C levels felt like. So I didn't know how to direct myself anywhere consciously. Although I've done so a number of times from within dreams. (I guess I subconsciously know how to do it, but that hasn't transferred yet to my conscious mind!)
<br>
<br>
Anyways, as I sank deeper in a meditative/trance state, I decided to try and make my own little area. Somewhere that I could recognize and build and play/practice in as I get my feet wet, so to speak. I didn't use any pre-conceived image, but rather formed my own. You all would probably laugh at my description. I really appreciate aspects of different environments. So my 'place' is actually a linking of 3 totally different environments. But I started with a mountain range and a lake at the base.
<br>
<br>
The interesting thing to me, was that when I began making this, and I was really having fun, I had two strange events happen. I started out at the top of the mountain, and there is just some light snow there. I looked down, felt the briskness in the air. The crunching of the snow under foot. I could feel the woods and the fresh, clean air. I floated up above the trees and glided down towards the lake. At one point, I looked up into the sky, and saw a large bald eagle. I flew up towards it and it turned and took off. I tried to follow it, but I lost it in the sun.
<br>
<br>
I thought it was strange, because I didn't recall thinking of an eagle. I landed, and was looking at the lake, when I felt a presence. I quickly turned around and saw a shadow of some sort. The impression I got was of a bear standing near me. I wasn't afraid or anything. But it startled me a bit and I lost the connection to the place. I also wasn't thinking of any animals in the mountains, although they would fit the environment.
<br>
<br>
So I guess my question for Ginny in this is, have you had beings appear in your 'space' uninvited or disquised as something, like an animal? I mean, you reference several times of placing intent. Have you ever gone out without 'calling' someone or placing intent and have someone show up anyways?
<br>
<br>
The eagle could have come from my mind -- I got a different feel from that than I did from the bear. I think the bear was a being, but I wasn't able to make any contact with him. And I do understand what you say about not 'seeing' but getting a feeling about something. I do this a lot in my dreams. I'll recognize someone but I rarely actually see faces in dreams. Its a feel to them that I recognize. And that's what I got here. Not that I recognized them, but that they 'felt' different.
<br>
<br>
I guess, if they show up again, I should first, not get startled, but second try and ask them who they are.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, just thought I'd share.

This is a great thread that I had not read until now. Thanks Soulfire for resurrecting it. The only thing I wanted to say was how very similar astral phasing and Bruce Moen's focused attention are. The astral phasing method I have been using came from what I learned from Frank. I write the specifics of this in another "sticky" topic called Phasing Methods.
<br>
<br>
However, the
<i>
 Focused Attention
</i>
method and the
<i>
 placing of intent
</i>
as Ginny so thoughtfully described, appears to be what I will explore next. I have been, as she described, in the 3-D blackness waiting for something to happen. Yet, after reading about the
<i>
 placing of intent
</i>
, my thought now is to try doing just that.
<br>
<br>
Also, I realize in reading the old posts of Frank, just how much I miss his being here. Perhaps I will place my intent on locating him in the astral. [

Thanks Nick for the information about the Phasing thread.  I am going to look for that one as soon as I type this.
<br>
<br>
Ginny, if you get a chance I would love to hear more about the process you use for "placing intent".  I know I am probably making this more complex than it really is, but that bit about finding the place inside you where intent is formed (paraphrase, not exact quote) really intrigues me.
<br>
<br>
If anybody has some good links with more discussion of "intent", I would greatly appreciate the info as intent is something I could really use some help with right now.
<br>
<br>
Thanks all...

<br>
I have never heard about Phasing until now.  But I can see where I have most definitely done this many times.  I just thought I was using my imagination!![
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]
<br>
<br>
I would like to add to this though, that we probably could not exist as we know it "without the imagination" and "continuously focusing our intent."  The use of our imagination is crucial to each and every experience that we have.  When you think about it,
<b>
 we use our imagination with intention constantly
</b>
.  I am "imagining right now" how I am going to write about the imagination and intention!!!  My thoughts are becoming words and the words are manifesting through my fingers and keyboard onto the screen.  So much of this last sentence was typed on "automatic pilot"—but—I needed my imagination to make it all happen.
<br>
<br>
Two more examples:
<br>
<br>
--When I was trying to decide whether I wanted a sandwich for dinner or a salad, I was using my imagination to draw forth what each of them were, as well as "run these images" past my sense of taste to see which one I preferred.  This all occurred in just a fraction of an instant—and while I was totally unaware of it, and I don't recall actually "seeing a sandwich" or "a salad", I instinctively know that I must have used my imagination to make my decision.  I was also hungry, so my "intent" was also strong and so I "zeroed in" to feed myself!!!
<br>
<br>
--Have you ever wondered "who was driving your car" when the last thing you remember "seeing" was say, a mile from your house, and the next thing you know is that you are sitting at a stop light across town?  That can be pretty weird, huh?  Well, I think somehow this experience is connected too.  For example, my "imagination" already knew the way to my friend's house, so I didn't need to conjure up the images themselves. "I just went there."  While I did not remember the miles in between, I do remember what I was thinking about during that time, I wonder if it was my "imagination" and my "intent" that helped to get me there safely?
<br>
<br>
I suggest that perhaps this is the same thing at work when creating a space on F27, we should just learn how to do it "outside" the normal parameters of our, much taken for granted, moment to moment processes.
<br>
<br>
Maybe we are making some of these things seem harder than it really is?  Am I on target with this???
<br>
<br>
I do maintain though, that whether it is popular to have an "active imagination" or not and whether we are aware of it or not,
<b>
 we are constantly using our imaginations hand-in-hand with focused intention
</b>
.
<br>

  It really is most useful.

  I hope people can see a pettern forming here when they compare your experiences with those of Frank and others, it is extremely clear that
  <b>

 <br>
 <br>
 **********Yep. We've all been raised with the idea that imagination is 'fantasy'...that it has no validity in the world of facts and concrete whatever. The best description I've heard to date regarding the difference between the two is....'imagination is this incredible, innate gift we're each born with, and since we know virtually nothing about it we end up using only a tiny fraction of it to 'fantasize'. In other words, fantasizing is a result OF using imagination.  There is just a limitless amount of things we can do with imagination, fantasizing being only one. Bruce Moen teaches that, say, in the beginning of learning to explore, if you want, go ahead and just *pretend* you're having a conversation with a deceased loved one in your mind or in the afterlife: pretend the conversation back and forth, pretend the environment....and watch for anything unexpected to happen, such as your loved one saying something that isn't in your own 'pretend script'...or they do something unexpectedly, suggest the two of you go somewhere. It's then you begin to realize that somewhere along the line, something real developed. This is using imagination to 'prime the pump', as Bruce says. It happened to me, big time!*******************
 <br>
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 It is also clear that phasing provides for the possibility of much more rewarding and enduring experiences than classic OBE.
 <br>
 &lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 <br>
 ***************Well you've got my yes vote on that one. I must have read Bob Monroe's books ten times each through the years, and I not only had great respect for him and what he did for all of us, I just flat out loved the guy. What a big heart he had (has). And yet, Adrian, I knew I never wanted to spend years, as he did, figuring out how the subconscious can literally 'take us for a wild ride' in OOBEs. Perhaps others have a different take on this, but I've had many OOBEs and I just could never control them. It seemed to me all the beliefs and fears and silly movies and junk tucked away in my brain were unleashed during OOBEs.....and who needs that??---LOL!  With Phasing or Focusing Attention Within I have control through the placing of intent. **************************************
 <br>
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 Creating a scenario by means of the imagination  - which is very much a spiritual faculty - invokes its Astral counterpart like a lock and key. This can be a self-created scenario, or it could be a known gateway symbol to another realm. All that is required is a necessary pre-phasing procedure.
 <br>
 <br>
 Ginny: could I ask you - what is your level of perception like in the Astral while you are there? Is it a real 3D, full colour, holographic "I am here" type experience, or is it more vague than that. I take it that there is no doubt anyway.
 <br>
 &lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 *************In the beginning I was in the frame of mind that I had to 'see as we see in the physical', while in the afterlife, in order to believe it was real. Creating my special F27 place really helped me to perhaps strengthen my mind's eye so that I saw color and objects moreso while There.....but for the most part, I do not see in 3D while There. For me it just isn't necessary. I choose to FEEL while There....pay attention to rotes that come to me from Helpers or even nonhuman entities. Usually I can ask for and get images (sometimes fuzzy, other times in color and real looking, as well as fleeting impressions)  just like images we 'see' in the mind's eye, but I seem to need this less and less. And one has no doubt, especially when we're able to get info from a deceased relative or friend---info we had no way of knowing beforehand---that we can then verify through still-in-the-physical living folks.**********************************
 <br>
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 How vivid and active does your imagination need to be to trigger the Astral projection? Does it have to be very clear. I know this is a concern to some people, because powers of creative imagination do vary.
 <br>
 &lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 <br>
 *****************Guess what? If I understand you correctly, Adrian, the way I see it, being able to 'see' with the mind's eye doesn't trigger being able to be there in the afterlife, within. Intent does it. 'Seeing' throught the mind's eye can be an aid in helping one become oriented while There, or perhaps helps one to become acquainted with being There and building trust to further explore. When I want to, say, visit F27...I don't see that place vividly in my mind ahead of time (I can if I want, if that helps). All I have to do is place the intent to be in F27. If I've never been there, just place the intent and go. If I've already been to Frank's library, I can use that image but I must *place intent* to actually get there. And by the way, in the afterlife we all perceive a little differently anyway. Frank's library may appear to me as a 1960's high school type of building and interior, while his perception of it  may differ a lot. It doesn't matter because info gathered from that library and comparing that info later is what helps us know it's a very real place (partnered exploring). Bruce Moen rarely has physical-like images while in the afterlife. He learned that perceiving with nonphysical senses was  the language There. The retrieval I posted here of the Confederate soldier?-----This was not like being in a movie with 3D physical likeness all around. I had fleeting glimpses of him sitting under a tree, of a field beyond with trees and fencing. What I locked into was what I felt from that individual...and what Helpers were sharing with me ('knowing feelings', thoughts, impressions, sensing, rotes), prior to getting the guy to simply become aware of the fact that he could leave.*****************************
 <br>
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 How do you contact your guide and/or helpers and get involved with retrievals once you have arrived at your Astral place?
 <br>
 &lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
 <br>
 <br>
 *************I just place the intent to meet with Helpers or Guides to help in a retrieval before I phase or focus attention into the nonphysical, or after I get to my special place. What I've also been learning is that Helpers, especially our own Guides, are just a thought away anyway. They're right Here, with us, as is all life physical and nonphysical. It's really cool to sit quietly in one's special F27 place... and place the intent for a Guide or Helper to appear---even if you just want to have a chat and ask cosmic questions, ask for help in perceiving the nonphysical better, or assist in retrievals.**************

 You know I hear alot about guides, helpers etc... But I don't think I have ever heard anyone say what specifically these helpers or guides do.  Are they from God? Do they have a name?  What are they here for and who gives them responsibility for us?

Novice,
<br>
<br>
Oh yea, many times. I actually welcome unexpected persons and things happening when in the afterlife.
<br>
<br>
When first starting out and while spending time at the first place I created, a wolf appeared. Now this wasn't that much of a surprise because I love wolves, but it was what the animal started communicating to me that blew me away. I had the strong feeling that the 'wolf' was actually a persoanl Guide, in wolf's clothing, only because I was new and wouldn't have found its presence an 'intrusion'. I've also had people appear while in the middle of retrieving or busy with something--such as a man I had actually helped to retrieve over a year earlier! I had no idea this could even happen.
<br>
<br>
I love your description of the snow and feeling the air in the place you created. Don't you appreciate the feeling you have when you're there...evn if it's to do nothing more than hang out and investigate?
<br>
<br>
Look forward to hearing more about your experiences, Novice.
<br>
<br>
Much love,
<br>

Hi Nick,
<br>
<br>
This certainly isn't necessary but I've learned so much from them...and that's to place the intent for a Helper/Guide to show up, while in the 3D, before going where you want to go. They're great company---:o).

Hi Soulfire,
<br>
<br>
Beth said it really really well--we use our imagination and intent constantly. When Bruce Moen directs people, in a relaxed and conscious state, to simply 'get a feel for that place within where we intend everything', he does this to help folks literally slow down to become aware of what they've been doing naturally all their lives...and to simply become familiar with what that state of intention feels like. And it's not a situation where there's one particular *feel*---everyone experiences it in their own unique way (some see color or whatever, others feel this or that--I experience a nano-second of nothingness that has a particular feel to it that I recognize---what's important is to just familiarize yourself with it...and above all, realize that our intent works everytime, because that's how life works....it's our beliefs and expectations that can get in the way).
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

Well, after I posted on Monday, I decided to try and visit my place again. I hadn't been there in a week or so. I usually try to do this over lunch time for me, which is what I did on Monday.
<br>
<br>
I didnt' do any retrievals or anything like that. But I did get to make contact with the 'bear' from the first visit. And I had a really fun and interesting eagle experience too. Here's an excerpt from my journal on this:
<br>
<br>
I begin imagining my mountain retreat. When I feel it, I float up above the trees and then head down towards the lake. I float over the lake to the other side and help a plant grow and climb up one of the trees. I then turn and imagine the eagle appearing again. Its in the sky, and I take off after it. It heads into the sun. I lose it for a moment, but it then turns towards the right and heads into a dive towards the center of the lake. I follow it. I'm slightly to the right of the eagle and my head is a bit behind its head. It is going very fast, and I am easily able to keep up. But as we are diving down, I begin to change. One second I am the eagle. And then the next second, I'm myself again. This happens several times. And each time, it feels very different. I can feel my face morph into the shape of an eagle's face. I feel like I'm actually inside the eagle for a brief moment.
<br>
<br>
When we reach the lake, the eagle uses its talons and quickly grabs a fish near the top of the water, which surprises me. It immediately heads back up and towards a mountain peak. I'm following it, but also looking back at the lake. I didn't remember putting any fish in the lake and was surprised that they were there. Although I guess it makes sense that there would be fish. When we get to the peak, there is a nest with several eaglets in it waiting. The eagle drops the fish into the nest and then rests on the side of it. I'm floating parallel with the nest, but not in it or touching it. The eagle looks me in the eyes for a second. I then glance at the eaglets. They were so cute. But I respectfully back away slowly. I didn't want to interfere. I then turn and float back down to the ground.
<br>
<br>
From the ground, I glance back up at the eagle's nest. I then remember the bear and try to imagine its presence again. I imagine the bear and turn around to see it. I wait a minute, trying to get a 'feeling' from it. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it or not. So I ask who it is. Intuitively, I feel like it's an Indian. Of course, the bear then morphs into an Indian. I ask something like what does it want. I wait a moment. Then, when I don't feel anything 'coming' from it, I imagine what it would say. I then imagine it saying that I can fly and float very well, but that I need to work on going inside myself. So I levitate above the ground in a half lotus position, and begin to meditate while there. I try very hard to go inside myself. I then hear the Indian say "that is good. You need to continue to practice this."
<br>
<br>
I then stop and stand again. I ask him his name. I wait, but don't get an answer. Next he moves his arm as if he's tossing something in the air over the lake. I look and see a rainbow appear. But it isn't a full rainbow. It starts just above the lake and heads up into the sky. But the sky is now no longer blue and lit by the sun. It is pitch black. But we still have sunlight where we are. I understand that he has 'moved' my sky and is opening it into the astral, for lack of better words. The rainbow ends up there somewhere. He floats towards the rainbow and follows it up. I follow right behind him.
<br>
<br>
When we are completely out of my area, I can't see anything. Its completely black. I also don't feel anything. I call out to him. But I don't hear anything. I then close my eyes and try to go inside. As I do this, I hear him encouraging me to do that. I continue and try to go inside as deep as I can. I get the sense that as I do this, I'm moving upwards. But I don't open my eyes. I then come out of meditation/trance. End session.
<br>
<br>
Its a rather long store, sorry. But I really enjoyed the experience. I also thought it was interesting that I started out imagining the bear presence and the eagle. And they both first appeared as my imagination. But within a moment, I wasn't imagining. Even what I imagined the bear saying to me, I said, but as I heard it, I know I didn't think those thoughts. And the rest was all him.
<br>
<br>
Also, just like Ginny said, I get the feeling of a bear, or eagle, or lake. But I don't see in full color, 3D like physical sight. However, I will get very crystal clear glimpses or flashes or images like that. For me, this usually happens as I move more into the space consciously. Meaning that, in the beginning, I am there, but also aware of my physical surroundings. I think because my consciousness is split, I don't see either one completely. But as my focus is shifted more into the astral area, I lose physical perception. But the astral impressions become stronger and I get more detailed images or flashes as I progress. But I still rely heavily on feeling and perception. I think images can be misleading. They will vary for each individual. But a feeling is more stable. As I write that, I realize it sounds like a contradiction, but its not.

<br>
<br>
I was just thinking...is this why your Guide suggested you 'go within'? Doing so was perhaps a step towards relying less on our habit of wanting to experience with the 5 physical senses and moving towards opening up to telepathy, feeling, knowing? And yes, you have it so correctly---that images are subjective, no matter how we access the nonphysical--and we're going to experience them no doubt, but it's fascinating when we use nonphysical senses to get to the heart of any experience.
<br>
<br>
Your description of using your imagination to 'prime the pump' or get things rolling is exactly what can be done. It's like sending out a signal that you want to meet with someone again, or be in a certain place, by recalling the feeling of them/it or just imagining something new...and just allowing it to be there. And then they/it seem to take on a life of their own by stepping in, so to speak, and continuing your intent...but with their own presonality and existence, their own communications...and when unexpected things are said or happen, it's fascinating.
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to reading more of your experiences--:o).

<br>
Ya know, when I first started accessing the nonphysical, I was truly out of my mind with happiness. I had waited so long to be able to just be There...and while I was zooming all over the damn place wouldn't you know, it was lovingly suggested I share with others what I was experiencing, suggested more than once (I kept putting it off...lol). Being a person who is usually standing near an exit door in big crowds, it was difficult to just post on the internet, but I did, because remembering the isolation from years back when I had no one to even talk with about any of this was an important reminder. I mean, I lost friends and had family members think I was nuts and scary when I mentioned my beliefs or brief experiences.
<br>
<br>
So, we're all related, ya know?

Hey Soulfire!
<br>
<br>
I'm certainly not an expert in this at all. But I can tell you what my experience has been. I have read a lot of sites that say astral projecting/phasing is the same as an OBE. I wasn't sure about this personally. I tend to read and observe, but I reserve my opinions for my own experiences/intuition.
<br>
<br>
I have experienced my ethereal body several times. To me, an OBE is utilizing the ethereal body, which is one layer above/out of your physical body. And its that layer that you need to use in order to visit the Real Time Zone. From my understanding, the real time zone is the equivalent of the etheric realm for all things. So your house has an etheric double, if you will, in the real time zone, etc. But in order to access that area, you need to use your ethereal body.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, you cannot use your ethereal body to access the astral plane. You need to have your consciousness shift to your astral body. From what I've experienced, the bodies correspond to vibrational levels. The higher the vibration, the higher the body used.
<br>
<br>
I also use phasing to shift to the astral. My (limited) understanding of things at this point, would lead me to believe that you need to exit your body into your ethereal before you could enter RTZ. I don't think that you can phase into your ethereal. But these are my very limited perceptions at this point. So I would certainly see how others respond because I could easily be way off base here.

 <br>
 Hi everyone,
 <br>
 <br>
 Here's what I've learned to do regarding phasing or focusing my attention away from the physical and into the nonphysical, to explore the afterlife. From what I've been able to determine, we can use whatever methods seem to resonate with us...but I have discovered that becoming acquainted with and *feeling*  the stages we use to  get into the afterlife can be important. Also, paying attention to what we're *feeling* while in the afterlife, using the nonphysical senses, is just as important. In the beginning of exploring I subscribed to the, "if I can't see it I don't believe it" idea,  and my progress was slow. But this is how we learn: by just doing it, going there, learning first hand.
 <br>
 <br>
 I started in the late 80's with the TMI Gateway tapes and used those methods (but at that time I thought I had to go OOB to explore) but discovered two years ago that Bruce Moen's simple techniques worked much better for me. I spend less time now preparing to go into the afterlife and get much better results while there, including many afterlife experiences wherein I was able to get verifiable info to really prove to myself that all this was very real ( I was a major skeptic til I got irrefutible proof that even I couldn't somehow rationalize away!---LOL!).
 <br>
 <br>
 There are 4 basic steps I use to focus attention away from the physical to explore within. **And just a quick note here to Focus 15---when you attend Bruce's workshop soon he'll not only explain these steps  (plus additional techniques) but guide you and the small group into them, several times as you experience afterlife journeys. I'm just a student of his and believe me, he's the teacher and a good one. What I'm describing here is a brief overview---at the workshop you'll get a much more in-depth idea and feel from him on these steps.**
 <br>
 <br>
 Step 1--Breathing for relaxation
 <br>
 Step2--Energy Boost
 <br>
 Step3-- Filling with love for better perception
 <br>
 Step4--Placing Intent
 <br>
 <br>
 Step1---Sitting in a chair or lying down, I close my eyes and begin to gently breath in (let your inhale be normal) and as I feel my lungs fill I then gently roll that inhale into a gentle exhale (once again just exhale normally--no forceful breathing, just let each inhale flow into an exhale and gently loop back again). I do this 3 times or as many times as needed so that when I FEEL myself relax (which is a slight phasing or shift of attention in itself) I then can move on to the next step.
 <br>
 <br>
 Step 2---In this relaxed state, see  with your mind's eye or feel a large pool of sparkling clean energy below you. As you begin to gently inhale, breathe in and see this energy enter your feet and travel up through your body and out the top of your head...and then see this energy curve out and down back to the pool below. Repeat this 3 times, cycling the energy back up through you and back down to the pool,  or as many times as you want. Now see a large pool or body of sparkling energy above you. At the top of your head locate or feel  a spot, perhaps where the center may be...and then as you inhale, breathe in and see this energy enter that spot and travel down your body, exiting your feet...arcing back up to the pool above. Repeat this 3 times or as many times as you feel is good for you.  When I do this I choose to see the cycling energy as something similar to what fireworks sparklers look like when used at night. This is just my preference. What's important is what this does for us regarding gathering energy: it's a great boost. You may want to pay attention to what this feels like too.
 <br>
 <br>
 Step 3--I know there's been a lot of misunderstanding regarding the use of 'love' in afterlife exploration. I for one, years ago, literally got tired of the word because it was over used, misused perhaps. When Bruce talks about PUL, pure unconditional love, he's not saying to get emotional, sappy or sexual...and especially, he's not talking about intellectualizing it, or seeing love as a concept. Experiencing emotions or other feelings can be the results OF accessing this energy. Bruce  learned in the afterlife that unconditional love is a real energy/consciousness...quite possibly the energy/consciousness that we not only come from, but it's what we are, now. Being the kind of explorer that has to prove to herself through direct experiencing what is real or not,  I have accessed this energy many times, not only to improve my perception for exploring, but to help others while There and even in my conscious physical daily life...and it's impossible to explain the experiencing of it: it's something that has to be directly experienced to KNOW what it really is. While in the afterlife I have unexpectedly been on the receiving end of this energy and it was without a doubt the most incredible knowing/feeling I've ever experienced.
 <br>
 How to access it is not difficult. This energy/consciousness is not exclusive: it does not belong to the 'spiritually advanced'...it belongs to all of us. And once again, FEELING it is the key.
 <br>
 Remember a time when you either felt love for someone or something, or a time when you felt loved by someone. Feel that love and hold it within you, let it build as you recall more moments or people you've loved or been loved by. Bruce recalls the love he felt for his newborn babies when he held them for the first time in the hospital. I always bring to me the love I have for my husband and two chihuahuas, as well as the love I felt from my mother. Whatever works for you---just FEEL  this love and let it build up and remain within you.  I could go on and on about the numerous benefits from accessing this energy, especially for afterlife retrieving and exploration, but it's something each preson has to experience, to understand.
 <br>
 <br>
 Step 4-- When I was using the TMI Gateway tapes over 13 years ago, if I had known then what I know now about the placing of intent, I never would have spent so many hours hanging out in that inner 3D blackness--while using a tape---waiting for something to happen. I would get to a focus level and then just wait for someone or something to happen, having no idea that all I had to do was mentally state my desire---where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do. Now I know that placing intent is a simple thing to do. Actually we do it constantly and really never give it much thought.
 <br>
 What Bruce calls, The Little Finger Exercise: this is where I am now going to FEEL that place within where we actually place the intent for anything. I use this everytime I want to place the intent to explore because it works. As I remain relaxed, knowing I'm going to move, say, my index finger in a few seconds, as I approach that moment of actually moving my finger I first just feel and become acquainted with that area within where we make things happen. Some people 'see' color or perhaps an image, some just feel that inner place. At Bruce's workshop I 'saw' a soft orange color (why I don't know)...but most importantly, I became acquainted with what that area of consciousness *felt like*. And when you're there, move your finger. And then do it again but instead of moving your finger, place your intent (desire) on where you want to go in the afterlife, who you want to meet, etc.  I must say here that I don't feel I'm explaining this step well....but I hope you guys can get the drift. There are times in the afterlife when I just relax and send out a mental statement.....place my intent. I hope I'm not making it seem more difficult than it actually is. I think Frank has a good handle on intent---perhaps he can explain this better.
 <br>
 <br>
 So this is pretty much what I do each time I want to Phase or Focus My Attention and move into the nonphysical.  There are a few more techniques I learned, such as Heart Intelligence, but this is probably enough.
 <br>
 <br>
 My Focus 27 special place:
 <br>
 Two years ago while reading Bruce's first book, he descibed creating his own special place in F27. Since I was so anxious to get going with exploration (and especially since I discovered through his books that anyone could visit all the focus levels at anytime, and that OOBEs were cool but completely unnecessary to explore and retrieve), I decided that if he could create his own place, so could I. Once placing the intent to go to F27, I was then in that 3D blackness,  just floating.  I decided to *trust* that my intent was the key in getting me there, to F27. I then borrowed the image of a city park I had loved as a child, complete with pond, trees, a park bench, grass, sunshine....and just 'saw it there' in front of me. I then walked into it. I sat on the bench and felt the wooden slats on my butt. I felt the soft moist earth and grass between my toes. I looked at the sun twinkling between leaves and branches above. I sat and looked at the water, and then decided on what flowers I wanted and where. I played with different kinds, on that first visit as well as later. All I had to do to return to my park was to just place the intent to be there (and it really helps to recall the feel of the place  too---this is another Bruce technique but I don't want to overload here). Thought, intent.. creates matter and all dimensions, physical and nonphysical.
 <br>
 <br>
 All righty then...it's late and I hope I've been able to explain well enough. Sorry for the screwed up replies to the wonderful posts from you guys. What can I say?---I'm a certified computer dummie!----:O)
 <br>
 <br>
 Much love and happy trails,

this text contains the exercises for making the world on type our universe, in "space f 27". be required russian speaker, translator, for which russian native language contains peculiar to russian language of the word by untransferable automatic translator, even avoiding this - be lost sense under inverse translation, search for the translator, good luck you! though can be this will help you to catch the idea, below ruled by mnoy. but not whole but that I have already bored to rule the text.
<br>
<br>
Free, as energy of the creation
<br>
âëàäåòåëÿ((Possessing)), as energy of our experience and knowledges
<br>
Transition level energy, as directional potential.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Exercise  1.
<br>
Try to disconnect all their own feeling. Do so that You nothing do not disturb. Try be weakened. Now, try to present certain started space. Dark. No light. But You feel this space and try to feel itself in this space. Beside You the feeling that You as it were lad midair. For You appear the determination a space, in which You turned out to be. It Appears that under You that on You. Before You endless space.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Explanation to exercise  1.
<br>
All simply. Track for their own action. That You have done, possible describe as follows. You have sent its thought in emptiness, which before this had a no place. You created this emptiness. Trying feel this space, You have opposed to itself this emptiness, having added by her form, principles of the formation, made her(its) characteristic. So You created the space. In this space You have been able to install accustomed You coordinates. Now You have felt that was found on You, under You and near by You.
<br>
You created the certain unrealistic world. As many from like this world, created by You world exists only while You think about him, keep him(it) in its consciousness. He not about exists long. But even that short time of its existence, he will be real for itself. He will be a world.
<br>
Than his(its) existence is conditioned? You have sent in emptiness its consciousness, its thought. The Thought has an energy base. In thoughts, sent by You, are present the elements of Your experience and knowledges, Your desires to make anything, Your longings to that-that high, clean, free from tie, which are bound You. All this elements that that people name the shower, but we - an energy of the symbiosis. Practically, You have put in created by You world its energy, having provided temporary existence of this world. Your energy supports him(it).
<br>
<br>
At desire, possible produce the following experiment, purpose which graphically show the process of the diffusing to energy of the city in empty space, being revenge of the accomodation of Your city. Visualize that You have placed in certain space, in which was emptily glass ball, pervaded gas. The Walls of this ball do not give to spread the gas in this space. But if take away the walls, that gas with enormous velocity scatters on started space. This comes of energy of the world, which You create. The Initial energy, which You have put in it, founding on their own internal resource, spread disappears in surrounding space. The Emptiness last extends this energy. The Initial energy, which You put in created by You world, - is limited. This restriction is caused Your possibility. If consider the amount to energy in unit of the volume, that possible notice that it in the course of time goes to zero. This possible name constant and general trend for energy of the city. Considering this trend, possible expect arising the deficit to energy required for maintenance of the city. This means that city or will constantly need for energy support essence, created him(it), or will begin by itself to generate this energy, or will stop its existence, since approaches the moment, when energy required for maintenance of existence of the world will become it is not enough.
<br>
The Deficit to energy in city brings about vampire of the city to essence, created this city. In this case city renders on its creator certain influence, calling to itself his(its) attention. Such world attracts us its full correspondence to with our desires. We direct their own daydreams to that that to should like to have, what should like to live, whom should like to be. Such a interaction gives us dim possibility to feel the weak response that feeling, which we felt, being inwardly this world, participating in event of this world. Interesting that fact that we themselves often want to live in this illusions that this answers need. As effect this essence created city newly and newly in their own thought returns to its brainchild. Causes the difficulty to define practicability of the similar building. On the one hand, thereby, we capable to express and formulate our daydreams, on the other hand, city extends our energy, which we could direct on the other purposes. Possible that in this instance we have before itself choice, which us there is do.
<br>
We shall Expect that someone, having created city, a certain time used this city for development determined ideas. Such a situation possible to observe amongst people creative during that, when they create the new image, or amongst engineer, designing something that they constantly "roll in its head". That s as a result - having resemblance city. This city is not adapted to independent existence. He exists only until to him is directed thoughts of his(its) creator. Hereon city stops its existence as such. However result of the similar building is worded idea. Thereby, possible draw a conclusion that building world is one of the forms of the thinking and is used enough often. At vampire of the similar world in most cases there is justification.
<br>
The Deficit to energy of the city is exactly that factor, which limits time of existence of this city. Possible that time of existence of the city defines the degree of his(its) development and importance of this city as such for his(its) creator. As effect we have presence èäåé designed on different level of the realization. Accordingly, for generation and development ideas we use the city, but our ability more full-fledged to use this city defines our capacity to work as a whole. Wholly appropriately remark that ability society to work with city and development of this direction are not last factor in development of the civilizations this society.
<br>
<br>
If speak of building of the city, as the world, that possible notice that reason of the deficit to energy is not only diffusing to initial energy of the city in emptiness, but also growing or expansion universe, in which is located created world. This reason has its explanation. So To in its work To: SPACE ENLARGES SINCE TIME FLOWS considers the growing an universe with standpoint of the current of time. If You interest scientifically-motivated opinion, that You should get acquainted with this work. Exist and the other opinions about process and reason of the growing space universe.
<br>
Vozvraschayasi to question about restriction of time of existence of the city, we once again and once again turn its attention on deficit of the energy of the city, which grows depending on time. In given question defining importance has a question of the arrival to energy. This energy can be worked out as outside of city, so inwardly. When we speak of energy enterring in city from outside, that implies the vampire of the city to essence, created him(it). When we speak of generations of the energy inwardly most city, we imply existence of the laws defining like generation and mechanism to realization of these laws.
<br>
In spite of existence different approach to realization of the laws on generations of the energy inwardly city, the main condition like generations is an energy motion and interaction different element this city. In turn this implies presence a factor, which produce the similar processes. Thereby, is defined existence world, executing these condition, and existence world, which are not adapted for like action.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Exercise  2.
<br>
Execute the exercise  1 having added on completion his(its) following elements:
<br>
1. Present in certain place, which You have chosen the certain bundle of energy. Try to put power in it a little more. Try to feel him(it), having added him material form.
<br>
2. In formed in space subject add else little energies. Now present that this subject, not having born offered energy load, bursts, scatterring on ensemble splinter. These splinter scatter in all sides, óäàëÿÿñü from epicentre of the blast. Roll this blast in consciousness. Add him suitable for Your perception forshortenings.
<br>
At desire You may use the illustration to Exercise  2.
<br>
<br>
The Explanation to exercise  2.
<br>
Call attention, with what lightness You have been able to produce the changes to realities created by You world. The Material from which he consists - obedient You. This is explained èäåíòè÷íîñòüþ((identical)) of the source material. The Energy created by You world and energy of Your energy symbiosis have a general base. Herewith, energy created by You world are created on base energy Your symbiosis. Practically, created by You world is Your continuation. Exactly so You easy can produce necessary change in him.
<br>
Follows to note that thought consists of energy itself. In she is reflected and energy free, as energy of the creation, and energy âëàäåòåëÿ((possessing)), as energy of our experience and knowledges, and energy of the transition level, as directional potential. So, dialect about energy, participating in making the city we imply whole complex of the energy symbiosis.
<br>
Sometimes beginner in building world do the mistake. They try by itself to define all functions of the world, which they create. This brings about increase the necessary volume of the work on making the City. As effect of power of such person scatter in infinitely enormous amount molded, image, notion. It is Necessary to note that when making, the world to You not without fall itself define all physical, chemical and revolutionary laws, acting in Your world. You define only that want to note or change to Your world. The Whole focus is comprised in that that when creation of Your world, You use the energy of Your symbiosis. Amongst these energy is present the energy âëàäåòåëÿ((possessing)), which carries in itself information on nature of the things, and in particular: physical, chemical and that similar laws. Your thought gets the information base. À if speak of created by You world, that necessary to note that Your world, founded on Your idea, èçíà÷àëüíî((in the beginning)) gets this information base from You.
<br>
As that once to I came the letter, in which asked to explain what image energy changes in city. Call attention, on exercise, which You have executed. You have produced the action. It has caused the row others. Practically this You have changed to energy, having given birth motion in infinity. This and there is initial change to energy. But afterwards  Afterwards take effect accustomed laws physicists, chemistries. But further all go on logical chain action.
<br>
Considering exercise, which You have executed, we find not only lightness of the building, but also ability to ñàìîâûðàæåíèþ((have a liberty in production of their own ideas, action, show itself (as teenager) creative to express itself)) image ideas, which we put in this exercise. This moment possible to estimate, as way of the development of the abilities of the creator of the similar city. Producing action You "roll him(it) in head", but this gives You possibility to more full understanding the process, which reflects this action.
<br>
So, executing exercise  2, which we have offered You, You pass simultaneously several things. This and experience, which You have got, executing exercise; This and knowledges, about nature of the blast, physical law, acting in determined ambience and condition.
<br>
For the world, which You created, executing exercise, actions, made by You, mean introduction new factor, influencing upon development of this world. So, having created material body, You have defined the notion to matters; producing blast, You entered the notion of the motion to this matters and laws, on which is realized this motion. That You have produced, was founded on Your knowledge, experience and intuitions. Accordingly, notions characteristic Your perception render the influence and, possible say, define essence created by You things and processes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Exercise  3.
<br>
Execute consecutively exercise  1 and exercise  2. Not making break, got mindset on performing the exercise, produce the following actions:
<br>
1. Turn its attention on separate splinter, flying to endless space, which presents itself world, come up for result of the performing the exercises  1 and  2. This splinter is found in constant motion. Around he flies dust, which attracts the mass of this splinter. We look at it as on splinter, but indeed sizes of this splinter can turn out to be enormous.
<br>
2. We shall Expect that before us such enormous splinter. His(its) sizes comparable sun with size, to which You got accustomed. Dust around he forms the concourses, which move over to heavenly bodies, referred to as planet. We look at rotation of these planets, on appeared before imaginative âçîðîì((see)) ñâîåîáðàçíóþ((looking like)) solar system.
<br>
3. Now turn its attention on any one of planets. Before You platform for developing world. There possible create the life in any forms. There You may realize their own daydreams and desires.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Explanation to exercise  3.
<br>
We do not deny existence of the other types of the building, which, possible, will are determined other law, but accordingly to him will are presented other requirements. The Purpose persisting work is concluded in that to give You example of the similar building. We hope that You, founding on its experience, knowledge and intuitions ñîçäàäèòå((you will do to create)) in over and over again more beautiful creations, than that, on which You begin the study of this subject.
<br>
Either as in previous exercises, You have produced the row an action, having rendered direct influence on created by You world by means of directed èäåé, expressed in the manner of image, which generates Your consciousness. Either as in previous exercises, You were easy given these change, You created the directed actions, having logical and information central to Your perception. On base of these buildings You capable to produce the further evolutions.
<br>
Analysing process of the building of the city, we come to conclusion that any building (change), which we produce in city, is called to do created by us world more available our perception and change, which he can be subject to hereinafter. Herewith necessary to pay attention one more characteristic of our thinking. Possible that You already have pointed to the fact, executing offered You exercises You follow the way of the selecting the best image, which answers Your perception. However, generating these images, You "ïðèìåðÿåòå"((measure(try) to)) them to building, which You produce. This means that producing building You create not one, but immediately several realities. Under the further processing You change these realities, return to already created. This allows You to produce greatly suitable choice. The Additional realities created by You on way of the main building, are identified the reflections first degree.
<br>
Making the reflections first degree possible to observe not only when selecting the best variant to realities of the world during process of the conscious processing the city. Falling asleep, essence, not possessing ability to check its dream, continues the development to realities of the city, which it creates, but process of this development occurs on unconscious level. Considering this process, come to conclusion that falling asleep we render the direct influence on created by us city, herewith if process passes without our checking, that we generate and support existence of the reflections first degree for our city. Some researchers of this process point that reflections first degree are such consumer to energy essence, creating city, either as the main world. This opinion is conditioned èäåíòè÷íîñòüþ of the determination and initial energy, the general method of the formation and unconscious address to certain source point this created world.
<br>
Together with this is indicated on that existence of the reflections first degree carries the volatile nature. The Majority of the researchers of the process of the making the city points to typical trend, to which predisposed ordinary user to technologies of the making the city, which consists in that fact that, definable that reflections first degree are an ñâîåîáðàçíûìè vampire to its creator, they break the process of the making the city and are subjected to exactly that consequence, which expect. The Approach of the similar users not only is not believed, but also dangerous. The Problem is concluded in that that created by You worlds carry in itself certain danger for its creator, as the worlds-vampires, but this process has not a constant nature. Such characteristic world acts in that event only, when world not capable by itself to generate the energy required for maintenance of its existence. After the world is capable to provide itself necessary energy, he not only ceases to need for energy of its creator, but also capable to return excess generated energy such.
<br>
Either as in previous events, î÷åâèäåí((obviously)) choices, standing before creator of the city. This choice is concluded in question to create or not to create the city with reflections first degree. Your choice - Your choice. Only You have the right to take him(it). But our opinion that like reflections capable to help You more deeply study these aspects and hereinafter create the city more making in these attitude. Except this, exist else several advices, which offer the researchers of the process of the creation city. The First advice - carefully study the material and ïðîäóìàòü Your actions before making the city. Think that this advice does not follow to neglect and at other times. The Second advice more specific and has a direct attitude to subject of the creation world. He is founded on characteristic of the thinking be repulsed from already existing base of the determinations, which was designed earlier. The Second advice is concluded in full making the base world, under which understand the world, already capable to independent ãåíåðèðîâàíèþ((generate)) energy, but, accordingly, capable to independent existence. Making the reflections first degree hereon already does not carry the dangers its creator, since for base of these reflections rs the base world.
<br>
Having Returned to exercise, which You have executed, we trace that in him was created platform for the further buildings. Built by You platform has not only visual nature, which You have been able to observe during performing the exercise, but also hidden - energy, èäåéíûé. As it was said, there is no need to produce literally all actions, which comprise full creation of itself. Your thoughts get through filter of Your knowledges and experience. So formation energy, èäåéíîãî of the base occurs at a rate of Your subconscious automatically. This base is superimposed on ideas, images, which You use for making the visible base, producing ñâîåîáðàçíóþ inflexion èäåé and image to visualizations. Later You will be able ïîäêîððåêòèðîâàòü these notions, resting in already existing base.
<br>
So on base built by You platforms possible creation conflict and contradiction, types of power and their oppositions, which will bring about maintenance of the constant motion energy in Your city. As, for instance, opposition of the light and shade, time and emptinesses (See subjects "City: Directions"). This motion under determined condition will bring about independent generation by city to energy, which he, city, will be able to use for maintenance of its existence.
<br>
As it was said, during VWVappear in the dreams essence, creating city sometimes renders the certain influence on city. Often this brings the reflections first degree about making. But if essence is capable to check its dream, that influence on city will nowhere near not unconscious. In this case organism be capable to render on city influence, equal on power or even greater, than influence rendered during specially conducted for this session. In this case dream not only does not render bad for You and Your city of the influence, but also capable greatly to consolidate created by You.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Building of the world
<br>
Okinite glance its past, are brought back into the childhood, when toy in Your hand gained importance of the friend, when in their own play You created the worlds so colorful that got ready take them for reality. You are a veins in the world their own fantasy. You put in their own creations feeling and daydreams. The Personages, which You created, veins together with You.
<br>
That changed presently? You became senior. You often restrain their own feeling, ñòðåìÿñü be such, as all. Thereby You strike a blow its personalities. Forget all this. Live on its feeling. Become itself itself, become the person, capable to create the world, free itself from that restrictions, which constrain You, keeps You in hutch of the public relations. Try. This simply.
<br>
That You âûðîñëè((growings)) and anymore child, means only that You may use that knowledges and that experience, which You have gained for all these years. This experience will help You to build the world thought-outed, than beside child. In him You may reflect their own knowledges and daydreams, which actual for You presently.
<br>
Do Not are afraid to create its world. The most small, on that he capable - give You to realize that ideas and feeling, which move You, give You to look at this on the part of. This already not little. Such way ñàìîîöåíêè((estimation itself)) will help You to set in order Your looks at that or other belongings. Possible that having looked at itself on the part of, You solve to change in itself something.
<br>
The Worlds are divided on type of its creation on the worlds created under the individual approach, when You create the world different from that, in which You live, and the worlds, created on principle of the resemblance with that world, in which You live, but herewith exist some elements of the difference. In other words possible say that possible to create its not to look like the other world, but possible take the elements already existing and create the world to look like Your. Not all have a talent to create something its.
<br>
The Worlds are divided on zero hour of the counting out the action. This signifies that possible to create the world, having begun with started place, but possible take already designed beforehand platform. Making the world, described in Vethom Precept, is a making the world from the very beginning. But if You begin;start;commence with city, which You know and remember, âçÿâ him(it) for base, this will too operate.
<br>
The Worlds are divided on energy building on the worlds, autonomous that is to say capable by itself to work out the energy required for their existence, and the worlds-users (the worlds-vampires), which need for Your energy support.
<br>
As You understand, create the world, which comsumes our energy, - simply. To create the world, capable to exist autonomous, necessary more complex technology. All that was considered before this time - a worlds, which possible create. But our purpose to show You that possible to create the world, capable to survive by itself, without our support. Why we confirm that such worlds present the greater interest? The Answer forgive;pardon. The World, which generates the energy sufficient for maintenance of its existence, can continue its existence and in that event if our feeling will are unplugged from it. On the other hand possible say that possible existence and inverse energy relationship, which allows us to get the energy from created by us world.
<br>
In conclusion possible only want You success and give the small advice. If You solve to concern with the questions of the building of the city, You may create all that will only want, but without fall delete that You created if this not final variant or created by You World not capable to generate the energy. This advice is conditioned by nature of the city.
<br>
<br>
The Reality and not reality.
<br>
The World, in which You live, is a real world for You. This world You may real to feel. The World, which You created, for You unrealistic. You do not feel him(it) also, either as Your real world. Created by You world - a world unrealistic for You. But, he real for essence, which are found inwardly this world. They define the degree to realities of their world also, either as You.
<br>
You possess the ability to change anything in that world, which unrealistic for You. The Percent of the change, which You capable to produce strives to 100. But after all essence, dwelling in the other realities capable to change to produce the changes to our world, as in unrealistic for it, but, accordingly, available to change by way of the change energy potential.
<br>
What image for us, inhabitants to this realities, is made other reality. We define her(its) as certain building from imaginative image. But our thought carries the energy in itself. She is founded on energy. Thereby we can present other reality as energy building, in which thoughts creator this buildings have importances controlling potential.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Importance of the person with standpoint of existence of the world.
<br>
The World, in which we live, possible consider, as the world created. In this case person presents itself essence, which this world it is necessary to keep and îáåðåãàòü (take care), perfecting creation and increasing his(its) borders. All this sounds beautifully, but requires the certain knowledges about that that such world, as he is made as his(its) laws. The Duty of the person - understand its world, understand his(its) necessities, understand his(its) laws. If person will leave from observance of the laws of the building of the world, will not inflict he lead;guide;êîíò)conduct most world and its existence in particular?
<br>
The World - frail, in spite of its greatness, exists too much weak places, residing on border of power. We shall Cite an instance. One of the most most important for essence of the world, for person in particular, structures is an information flow. His(its) existence and reception capacity are stright connected with life expectancy essence, living in the world, their ability to occupation different type to activity. The Information flow influences upon choice and decisions each essence separately and all together. Public structures are formed On base of the choice. But, in spite of all its importance, information flow frail. And ignorant address with he bring about overloading that negativly tells on most world, but in the first place, on essence, his(its) inhabitting.
<br>
