Last night I spent several minutes(probably about 30) visualizing myself climbing this rope and theonyl thing I could really note was having a harder time focusing on the rope, and a "lighter" feeling. Â i was just wondering if there is a certain technique for hopping out of your body when you're in the right mind frame and if not what should I do to further my practice?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I think people concentrate too much on the actual rope aspect. It's just a figurative thing and is not meant to be taken too literally. It's the tactile awareness aspect that is important and this is what the technique is designed to generate.
<br>
<br>
Rather than climbing a rope, try giving your brain a rigorous massage with your awareness hands. It's a great sensation. Better still, do it to your partner at the same time and wallow in the joint sensations. It's the tactile awareness, or the sensation of
<i>
 feeling
</i>
that is the key to making it work.
<br>
<br>
You are not meant to be lying there merely visualising yourself climbing a rope. You should be engaging your tactile awareness. The rope is just a handy bit of metaphysical imagery that helps you do this. You can think of any kind of imagery you like. But the key to it all is to
<i>
 engage
</i>
your physical senses.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
