Astral Pulse has had 65 visits by the US military and 124 from the US government. Make of that what you will...! [

<section>
Thats very worrying to me. Why are they visiting? perhaps to research the occult and how useful it could be? or because they are worried about extremists and cults?

Maybe it's just soldiers who are into OBE's and related things.

<section>
well.. the government did have that remote viewing program in the early 90s.. they got so much negative feedback from it they said they closed it but from what ive read online of remote viewing, it is very much still in use today. i've heard that there are psychic individuals placed in places such as the head of security, head of communications, area 51, etc. that are specially trained to try and stop remote viewing from taking place there. its weird..
<br>
<br>
it'd interesting to see how much the governments been looking at other ap-related/occult sites.. maybe we can deduce something from that.
<br>
<br>
or maybe those visits were just by bored military/government people who had nothing better to do, and were interested in ap'ing [

Hmm ... thats interesting.  Like GTP said it could just be soldiers browsing sites.
<br>
<br>
Then again who knows with the Governments past record history.  They might be creating an army of Astral Projecting soldiers - US Gov. Astral training 101.

Hey, all.
<br>
<br>
Some random thoughts:
<br>
<br>
Does anybody really think they would be that obvious? I mean stuff does get over looked, but from a national perspective this is all "black" stuff that the general population is better (in their mind) not knowing.
<br>
<br>
Have heard of the remote viewing program from the information gathering side. It was supposedly one of the most successful departments for intelligence gathering. With that in mind of course you would protect your own assets.
<br>
<br>
From mechanically and designer drug enhanced metaphysical abilities most of us are probably toddlers compared to what the major governments know. Don't believe for a minute that they are not aware of or just realizing the potential of these things. Many of the founders of the USA were part of groups like the Free Masons and others. The magickal wars between France and Germany (WWII) are well known.
<br>
<br>
Now I have to go, the black helicopters are here........
<br>
<br>
Best to all.

Guys, come on. [xx(]
<br>
<br>
This particular conspiracy theory pops up every couple of months, and it's proponents suffer from the Curse of Self-Importance, i.e.,  "I'm so gifted and talented that I'm a Person of Interest to the Government!"
<br>
<br>
PLEASE. If you want to be a Person of Interest, drop some anthrax in the mail.  That'll get their attention.
<br>
<br>
That is not to say that various world governments don't spend valuable tax dollars on Otherworldly subjects.  But it's not as though they're the Thought Police trying to track down a Special Breed of Humans to do experiments on  (I think governments leave THAT work to the extraterrestrials. [

] JUST KIDDING)
<br>
<br>
RATHER, government researchers are normal human beings, just like you and I, who either have paranormal abilities themselves, or married people who can OBE, or have a passell of psychic kids, and they just want to know what's going on . . . just like the rest of us.  And they already have many volunteers for their experiments, having friends down the office hall to call on for support.  They don't need to lurk about on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///astralpulse.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Astralpulse.com
</a>
or any other kind of website addressing metaphysical matters, looking for that special someone (you?) to prove that OBEs exist.
<br>
<br>
Somehow I think some of you guys "doth protest too much."  Almost as though, if it ever came to be publicly known that the government was doing a major study on psychic ability, rather than run and hide, you'd run down the road to volunteer your services.  Seriously!
<br>
<br>
This is not an attack on any of you individuals personally.  This is just my opinion on the matter at hand.  I'm probably responding to the previous posts on this subject!  Perhaps I'll just save this to my hard drive and upload it over and over again, as the subject comes up.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
this puts a new light on Toms disappearence from the forum. The talent searchers from the government highjack our Premier Members. Frank will  probably be the next. So watch out Frank.
<br>
This also explains why RB made himself so rare on this forum. He knows and doesnt want to become a target as a Premier Member. Maybe we should use even more camouflage to hide our talents. People who work for government are not that clever, so a little will do.
<br>
Or lets try to confuse them by pretending we all can kill people by throwing Ki-balls at them. So they would all kidnap us and we could have a nice meeting at some area X training camp for psi warfare.

All Conspiracy Theorists have been planted in the community by the government and military in an attempt to misinform people about what is really going on. This is achieved through extensive secret training programs where these theorist are taught to specialise in making themselves sound like absolute idiots!

Helmut: I came to click on this topic several minutes ago but my wireless mouse simply froze in the middle of my screen. It's happened to me before. So please, save your breath, there have been
<u>
 so
</u>
many times in the early days when I swapped batteries... all to no avail.
<br>
<br>
Tonight, out of the corner of my eye, I swear there was a shadow at the window. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and the dogs began howling. Outside, in the distance, was a light. It was getting closer. Eyes wide I was staring, ready to meet my fate, but this time was just a warning.
<br>
<br>
It's the same pattern. Now I understand Tom's last PM. At the time it seemed garbled, but he was trying to warn me.
<br>
<br>
God knows how much longer I will be able to post to this BBS. I managed to shrug things off thus far as mere coincidence. But the events of tonight confirmed my days are numbered: I have a week, maybe ten days at most.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hey all.
<br>
<br>
You know what cracks me up most about the whole conspiracy theory debate? Most people stand at the two poles of everything.
<br>
<br>
If nothing ever happened to you, you think everyone considering it is paranoid. If you have the misfortune of doing something that attracted bad attention, and got interest from some of the functioning groups you are probably very paranoid, and no one would believe you. If you survived (mentally) going through indepth "investigation" you have enough sense to keep your mouth shut, as no one would really believe it anyway.
<br>
<br>
Bottom line odds are in your favor they do not care. Stay politically detached, do not project or remote view around say NORAD or area 51, and do not send any bad spells at the president and you should be OK.
<br>
Does it happen? Yes. Will it happen to you? Very doubtful.
<br>
<br>
Best to all.

I know why.
<br>
<br>
They are looking for talented people who can stop the giant asteroid and/or planet X on its way to devastate the earth, shift its poles, and bring the reptile people out of hiding from their places in the hollow earth;
<br>
<br>
scare away the little green, grey, or blue men from a galaxy far, far away;
<br>
<br>
get the Batboy to leave all our Presidents alone;
<br>
<br>
find the mother ship that is hiding behind the moon and the other one hiding in the ocean near where Atlantis fell;
<br>
<br>
talk to the shadow people;
<br>
<br>
and finally, at last, do something about those damned aliens who crashed in area 51.  [
