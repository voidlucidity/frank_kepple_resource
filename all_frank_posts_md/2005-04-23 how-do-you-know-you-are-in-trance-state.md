<section>
I've been meditating for almost two years now, on and off. I do not recall any experiences of going into deep trance. I am actually fully awake at all times and can hear everything in the background.
<br>
<br>
Is this trance state? How does one differentiate between the various states of awareness, and what kind of sensations would these states of awareness(alpha, beta, delta, theta) etc have.
<br>
<br>
I sometimes get the impression I might be doing something wrong and just remained in the waking state for the entire time. Any help would be much appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Peace

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what meditation is. Someone once described it to me as thinking more and more about less and less. I think Tom is the meditation "guru" on the forum. Hopefully he'll be along in a bit and point you in the right direction.
<br>
<br>
I doubt what you are feeling is a "trance" state. I think what the mystical bods call trance is more like the modern-day Monroe Focus 10, MABA state. After all, if "trance" is just sitting there fully aware of the physical then we'd all be in "trance".
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what it is you are attempting to do. But at a guess, there is something about pointing your focus of attention inwards that you have yet to get to grips with.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello.
<br>
<br>
Trance is not necessary for meditation.  Meditation is perfectly fine without trance.
<br>
<br>
However, if trance is what you're looking for, and a description of it, there's one at this very site.

Thanks for the help friends. At first glance, trance sounds a lot like meditation. Isn't that the whole purpose of meditation anyway, to enter deeper levels of awareness by stilling your thoughts.
<br>
<br>
I do sometimes enter a state when I can hear a very quaint humming sound. I've always assumed that it is just me noticing the background noise.
<br>
<br>
Yeah, I do think I do have a problem in completely internalizing. I think one possible reason is, I am distracted by the changing colours and patterns(closed eyes) and use them to gauge how deep I have gone.
<br>
<br>
That tutorial helped a lot Krev, thank you.

When i enter a trance, usually i feel a mental type of "click", like you know 100% sure u entered it.  Everythin just seems different, and u realize it.  You might also experience a "falling/vertigo" sensation, even with your eyes closed.
