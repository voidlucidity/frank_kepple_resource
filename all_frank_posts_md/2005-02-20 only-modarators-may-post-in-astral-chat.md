Hello:
<br>
<br>
I was not aware that was the case. It certainly shouldn't be and there have been new member posts in Chat since I came on yesterday. Is anyone else having this problem?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi,
<br>
<br>
The only forum wherein just the moderators can post is the new FAQ forum. It's located real close to the Astral Chat forum though.

Nor can I, but I only tried the thread which had been moved over from the thread about the FAQ section.

The only locked topics on Astral Chat are the two "announcements" at the top of the Astral Chat page. I'll look into it further though.

It is the whole astral chat forum that is locked for everyone except moderators. I went to the bottom of page 7 and it was still locked. The fast reply box is not there and hitting the postreply button reports back an error message about only moderators being allowed to post there. Obviously it would not be the same situation when checking with a moderator account, so if you are using a moderator account you will have to try a different account or just trust us that this is the case.

Tom,
<br>
<br>
I've posted on this in the Moderator's forum. Hopefully someone can figure this out. I've looked into it and have come up empty. If we can't solve it quickly, I'll email Adrian.
