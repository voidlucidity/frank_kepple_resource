<section>
Hey guys and gals,
<br>
<br>
Some of you may remember me.....others have no idea who I am!  I used to be a very, very regular member here (was a moderator in fact....sniff sniff....no longer though, it seems!).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, due to my hectic work schedule, I was forced to give up some of my online surfing and focus more on boring, work-related nonsense!  In fact, the only reason why I'm able to come in here now is that the boss is away and I've got some free time today!
<br>
<br>
So I guess to recap, my name is Jeff.  I live in Northern California.  I'm 29, married, and expecting our first daughter in probably a matter of days.  Woohoo!
<br>
<br>
I had my first OBE back in 1998, and since then, I've been a regular traveller, so to speak.  Some of my best times during the last few years have been posting here on the AP, and interacting with you guys.  I only hope that I'll have the time to be here to help and contribute like I used to.
<br>
<br>
Frank, my man, it's good to see you back.  I missed you partner, and you had me worried sick about your absense.

<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are so many articles and topics here that I can't possibly get to them all.  I'll just skim and contribute as time permits.  Looking forward to getting to know all of you again!

Jeff, you may remember me, as we traded a few posts a while back. Good to hear from you, and we're glad Frank is back as well. Congratulations on the birth of your new daughter!

Hi Nick....of course I remember you!  Good to be back, no matter how short-lived it may be!
<br>
<br>
We just got back from our OBGYN appointment.  My wife is now dilated at 2 cm., but they don't want to induce yet.  We have to wait another 6 days to see if she starts labor on her own.  If after that time she hasn't, they may induce.  Otherwise, since the baby looks BIG (8-9 pounds) and my wife is small (5 foot frame), they may just do a c-section next Wednesday when we go in!
<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I'm a bit anxious and nervous right about now!

Hi Jeff
<br>
<br>
Nice to hear from you. I hope you`ll be retuning to the forum but a new baby might put some serious demands on your leisure time! Let us know how it goes.
<br>
<br>
Cheers

Thanks Coral....I know that my hands are really going to be full these next few weeks.....but I am taking a month off from work, so hopefully in the wee hours of the night, when I am taking care of the baby, I'll also be able to come in here and contribute to the forums like I used to!

Jeff: good to see you back old chum. Hope all goes well maternity-wise. Had a few problems myself but nothing that couldn't sort itself out given a little time. I'm still alive, kicking, with a big smile on my face as per usual.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

Thanks Frank and Gandalf.  It's reassuring to see my old time buddies still holding the fort over here!
<br>
<br>
I'll keep you posted as to the progress of the pregnancy.  =)

Welcome back, Jeff. I had been wondering what had happened to you. Good to see that you are well, and you have a special someone on the way, congrats!

Good to see you again Jeff !!
<br>
<br>
Hope that the birth goes smoothly for you &amp; your wife, I'm sure it will. I've got a few friends now who are getting into this "making-kids" business....they seem to be popping out (not literally) left, right &amp; centre. I guess that 29-30 is "the age" to do it. !
<br>
<br>
Anyway, see you around the forums mate.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark

Hi Jeff,
<br>
<br>
I was also hovering around the astral pulse forums a couple of years back... and haven't visited for so long that my username was deactivated!
<br>
<br>
It was also work that kept me away... I started being a high school teacher this year and have spent the year writing assignments, marking and generally freaking out!
<br>
<br>
But it's lovely to be here having a look and trying to remember that part of myself.
<br>
<br>
Meg
