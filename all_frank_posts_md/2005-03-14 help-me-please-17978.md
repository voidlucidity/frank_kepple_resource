i need to know if what i experienced was an Obie!!! i "woke" up and turned over to see myself lying next to me(?) either dead or asleep...i saw this clearly but got really frightened!! i jumped out of bed shouting and then "went" back to my body.....i don't remember my dreams yet recall this vividly....so do you think it was an Obie? or was it a dream?
