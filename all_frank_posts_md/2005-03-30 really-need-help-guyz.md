<section>
2 years ago i started obeing , i succeded a couple of times, had a lot of LD. After about half a year i got involved into a sect, and stopped obeing, as i was in the sect i was told that i couldnt leave the sect without going mad. Finally i left that sect and about a year i was living in a world of fears , i was possessed by a though "i will go mad". Now i wanna start obeing again but so scared to go mad. Every time i think about oobes my fears come but and i cant stop thinking "what if oobe can make me mad" T_T..
<br>
Please help , guys. Thanks a lot.

Its too late, you are already mad.
<br>
<br>
Jokes aside, dont take any such guys so seriously. I think you should completely get rid of your fear before attempting the oobe.
<br>
Join a sect which says you can't go mad by leaving any sects.

What sect was this? What was it based on?
<br>
Sounds like some people have really gotten into your head-which is where all the stuff is coming from now.
<br>
<br>
If you oobe'd before and LD'd without going mad, can you give me one logical reason why now you would go mad?
<br>
<br>
Challenge yourself like this to start with. Find out what in you tells you that this sect has any truth in it. Why they'd need to implant emotional control into you? Were they insecure about the reality of their beliefs so need to instil a fear control into followers minds?
<br>
<br>
You rode the horse before without any problems-nothing has truly changed you know. You can do it again just as safely. The sect cannot alter that-they can only attempt to make you believe that they have.

Scientology hasn't infiltrated Thailand has it?
<br>
<br>
A belief is a belief and has the power to alter your reality whether it's true or not.
<br>
<br>
Where would we be if the Wright brother's listened to their neighbors?
<br>
<br>
Here's a mantra for you....  obeing can't hurt you and if I join the sect I will go mad.   lol

By now you should realise that like-attracts-like. If you're trying to overcome your fear then converse with your (spirit) guides and ask them for help. You don't need to speak to them directly, they are aware of your thoughts and if you ask them, knowing they are always there, to help you then they will. They are, after all, an extension of yourself.  Put aside some time to think quietly about it and get in contact with them.
<br>
<br>
The worst thing you can do is fear. Go into it boldly but peacefully also. If you start trying to confront your fear with anger then that's also going to be detrimental as like attracts like. The best thing you can do right now is calm down and if you can't stop thinking about it just keep in mind that help in the form of your guides is merely a thought away and that they care for you unconditionally.

Maybe you should consult a hypnotherapist, it would at least help you learn about your fears and stuff. I do alot of hypnosis and have seen many profound effects from it so, you might want to give it a shot.

well, I can only quote my self here!

 I think it's pretty clear to me, that depression / anxiety or any kind of mental imbalance is not a good grounding for Astral Projection.
 <br>
 <br>
 It will only, make things worse for you, Higher dimensions is a very big leap, for even someone who is perfectly OK.  It can only lead to confusion and even more trouble if you aren't mentally OK.
 <br>
 <br>
 To be blunt if you can't handle the Physcial Daily Realm of real life, you don't have a chance in trying to handle unseen dimensions of RTZ, Lucid, OBE or Astral Realms.  It's difficult enough for people who are can handle normal waking reality!  AP is a "Path" and you can't be mentally unstable in anyway if you are going to succeed at AP.  It really is as simple as that.
 <br>
 <br>
 Hope that makes sense.  You have to be ready to get into this stuff, I suggest you stay clear of it , the Fear Alone that's experienced is enough to unbalance anyone! In some ways, it's as if you can only succeed in AP, if you succeed in normal waking life, so that you are happy.
 <br>
 <br>
 My suggestion, would be to back off for a while.
