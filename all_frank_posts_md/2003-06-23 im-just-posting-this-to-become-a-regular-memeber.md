   Try instead to make a topic about something you want to talk about then make the second post like "Why isn't anyone replying?!"  That seems to work the best

Atleast to become a Regular Member, if you wanted to post a Topic, you could have chosen a Topic which could have made some sense and some knowledge could have been shared using it.

What happens when you get the maximum amount of gold stars?
<br>
<br>
Confetti and balloons begin falling from your ceiling,
<br>
<br>
A marching band assembles behind your computer chair and begins playing "Also Sprach Zarathustra",
<br>
<br>
And two toothy models in designer dresses appear like bookends and hand you a large, shiny, gold, trophy with engraving that reads:

Hey Bad Moon Rising,
<br>
<br>
It is a mantra/chant to the goddess Tara
<br>
<br>
Here's some info about her:
<br>
<br>
<font bold&quot;="" face='"Script' mt="">
 <font color='"green"'>
  "The Mother of All the Buddhas"
  <br>
  Tara is not only a bodhisattva, but also a goddess. Her name can have two meanings: either "star" or "one who takes across." Many consider her a saviour and liberator because she "takes people across the ocean of samsara." According to Buddhist and Hindu world views, samsara is the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that people are confined to.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tibet Tara is the consort of Avalokiteshvara and is called "Drolma". Many in Tibet consider her their Mother, just as Avalokiteshvara is their Father. Not only is she the Mother of Tibet, but also the "Mother of All the Buddhas" because she is a manifestation of the Prajna-paramita or "Perfection of Wisdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tara can take on many forms, in fact there are about twenty-one forms. They can range in color and appear either peaceful or wrathful. The two most common are Green Tara and White Tara.

Probably because it is to motivate people to post more. You see, first you have no star and green with envy, then you create  a useless thread. Behold, you get the beautiful green star. You become excited and fervently posting in anticipation of something more wonderful to show up. You thought you will get a shiny silver star, but the best they offer you is a drab grey star. You were fill with remorse, and anger. Not willing to be victimised you somehow knew a gold star was just in the corner, if you can post enough. The cycle start again. Up to now, there are only, 3 member with red star (which fall second in term of attaractiveness from the grey star IMO). It would be a long time before there is anything after premiere member (if any). Would Frank be able to endure the not so super attractive red star. We all hope he do as his post is very informative and helpful. What about squeek? He seem to be slowing down his post nowaday. Would he be able to achieve the red star? Or is he really trying to avoid the red star?

All this and more coming on the next fall in 2012....

"1,000,000,000 = hopefully, we shall never need this
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
"
<br>
<br>
last i heard (in a tech class in 8th grade), microsoft is really digging in to a project that will hopefully astromically increase how much a computer chip can hold. as an example of how much these new tiny chips would hold, if standard chips today were represented by a large stack of papers about one and a half to two feet high, then the newer chips, if multiplied to take up the same amount of space as our now standard chips, the newer ones would be represented by a stack of papers that could reach the sun from earth's surface. their progress is slow though, because they are working with individual atoms.
<br>
<br>
could you imagine how fast computers would be if this was finished up? it would be bigger than even the first great leaps in computer technology, where we went from computers the size of rooms to a small pc. even the biggest games of todays computers would be puny on a machine with one of those chips. we would have to come up with connections that could transmit huge amounts of information so servers for new games wouldnt lag... great stuff [

You are right No-Leaf. Even I've heard of this. I don't know whether it is Microsoft or not. I doubt it to be Microsoft. Well as you know that a transistor is used as a boolean signal (On or Off, 1 or 0 respectively). Well now they are working on atoms and the state of one atom will judge the state 0 or 1. So a Motherboard contains millions of transistors and a transistior contains several millions of atoms. So as the work of a Transistor will be transfered to an atom thus the size of the motherboard be even smaller than a Transistor. Cool...
<br>
<br>
Well such an accomplishment will take several decades to develop properly and then several years to become public.
<br>
<br>
So what if one atom of the motherboard is lost. A MILLION DOLLAR TO REPAIR IT CHUM!!!
<br>
<br>
But one thing for sure, those computers will be a million times faster than these ones. And by saying a million times faster I mean a MILLION TIMES FASTER.

Yes, Microsoft only develops Software and now has put some hand in hardware as computer peripherals, not computer itself.
<br>
<br>
I even doubt Gateway and Dell to be in such an operation. I think it might be IBM or some other Scientific research institute.
<br>
<br>
Do you know that IBM has recently produced the world smalled chip. It's diameter is some nanometers. It will be introduced in the market after some testing in about 7-10 years.

   I'm a thrill-seeker, so I'm all about coasters.  Space mountain was only crappy because they designed it for short people.  I seriously almost hit my head on one o dem's beams.

   Plus it isnt a real coaster unless you can put your hands up.  I clipped a beam when i did that :X

Oh c'mon, you already have an amiable presence here. I remember back when I was green on this forum and you were asking people to try and get you out of body if they managed to get out. I got lucid, and I remembered, I told someone "Someone make Kazbadan lucid!" and he went running off making fun of me.

Sure:  Here are my favorite Rolfisms:
<br>
<br>
"A dog has raised his hind leg on the edge of Nevermore."
<br>
<br>
"Rolf will grill your strudel until you cry like a teensy weensy baby."

and what I tell myself, to put away "the feather duster of tomfoolery".

Posting for the sake of getting more posts (which is what most of you are doing) is honestly a bit pathetic, but the nice thing is that it makes it easier to see who to take serious and who not to.
<br>
<br>
I still love these forums, but I recall the original days when it was just a few of us talking about our ideas and experiences passionately, with Robert Bruce chiming in occassionally.
<br>
<br>
Oh how things have changed!
