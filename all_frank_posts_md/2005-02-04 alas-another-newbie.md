Hello - I discovered this web a few days ago after ordering and receiving the Mastering Astral Projection book and was just wondering if any other newbies here have been working with the book?  We are starting a small study group (to keep each other motivated and compare progress notes) but would like to meet others who are just starting this journey.

Selski and Nick  thanks for the welcome.  I have been reviewing the forum for several days now and the wealth of information is overwhelming; it will take me weeks, perhaps months to digest.  What a welcome relief to find so many fellow seekers.

I plan on ordering that book, then practicing and reading it this summer.
