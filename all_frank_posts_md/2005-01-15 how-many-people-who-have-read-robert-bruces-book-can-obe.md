Hi Syro,
<br>
<br>
I had sporadic OB experience yrs before reading the treatise or Astral Dynamics, and found in recent years amongst reading/studying other works that Robert Bruce's writing helped to clear up a lot of misunderstandings/conceptions I had had. This also enabled me to start to gain control of these types of experience!
<br>
<br>
In light of your question - yes it would be interesting to see what the hit rate actually is as you ask above!
<br>
<br>
You might consider looking at Robert's new book Mastering Astral Projection. Although I don't (as yet) have a copy I had a chance to look through it during the recent workshop... and it is easy to see that it has been lovingly prepared by Brian, Robert and team. It is a fair sized book and considering the addition of the CD content and S/W great value for money.

If you are more interested in the Theory then look to Astral Dytnamics...

 Note:

according to Robert a revised edition is due out soon!

Best,

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I found the book very useful in that it got me projecting into the RTZ for the very first time. Prior to reading the book I had had hundreds of "astral projections" over many years, but the RTZ had always eluded me.
<br>
<br>
Astral Dynamics contains ever so many hints and tips and good all-round general information, you cannot help but pick up benefits from it. I'm not at all into the mystical or energy-work side of things, but the book piqued my curiosity about "chakras" and I had a whale of a time exciting these energy centres. It's immense fun.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I could project before I read Astral Dynamics but I still found that the energy body stimulations and exercises in this AP Bible  were superb . They helped me to become aware of my body during projections and not to concentrate only on my sight . His methods  do work. They are also a great reference . I find myself coming back to this book again and again . These methods  do perfect the energy body which I have witnessed clairvoyantly .
<br>
<br>
The Hermetic path speaks to the colouring in of the limbs which is witnessed in the perfected energy body . White Eagle and Kuthumi asked my group to view Robert Bruce's "perfected energy body ", when we were practicing the viewing of  the chakras and the energy body clairvoyantly .
<br>
<br>
It was a bit of a chore to do this but luckily he obliged me . At that time we had seen many sitters with the kundalini blue and yellow colours around their head or around both the head and chest. Healers notably had both hands and the dominant arm coloured in . We did not witness anyone with coloured legs.
<br>
<br>
But  when viewing Robert Bruce in 2004 one  could  see that he had a blue and yellow head and chest , an orange arm ,a blue arm, a salmon leg and a cyan leg . This is the basis of the perfected human energy body .  When this is achieved the seeker can project, feel and sense within spiritual realms during OBEs .

</a>
<br>
<br>
So when we saw Robert had all four limbs coloured in strongly and balanced it was all the proof one could ask for . Since then some of us in my circle have also come to this stage . But it has taken intense work 3 times a week for a year . We still do not find many peers . Most seekers develop only their head and their hands . I have to think Robert's work is special in his field and a hallmark in esoteric research . Seeing is believing .

I haven't been able to OBE yet but I finally ordered a copy of the book and I shall let you know if it helps after I read it.  I too, am curious to see how many people it helped.

help you get into real-time exactly, and what techniques, modalities, etc. exactly. Thanks!

That was very interesting. I've never heard a description exactly like it.
<br>
Can you view anyone's energy body whenever you want to?

I have projected after reading his book, he just explains everything so well that it made projecting very real after just a few weeks of practise. I highly recommend astral dynamics.
