A nightly experience for me (for several years) was the appearance of an intensely bright light almost immediately upon relaxing into sleep. The light was too bright to look at, was large and right in front of my face. The first time it came I jerked my head aside ending the experience and ended up with a headache that lasted for days. A few days later it occured again. I shifted my external perception away from it but kept my conscious attention on the brilliance and was not slammed this time. The overly bright light transmuted into an indescribable shimmering silvery fog that fairly quickly lifted to expose one of the most beautiful scenes I had ever seen. I was now standing on a grassy hillside on the edge of a high cliff, overlooking a beautiful blue ocean. This is a place I have now gone to thousands of times, always preceeded by the light. I started beginning to inspect my surroundings, the grassy undulating hillside and cliff edge. When I looked up the hillside, angels were watching, waiting for me to see them, whence they took me up the hillside to "school". A temple (that appeared like crystal from the outside, but like marble inside) where-in classes take place. I joined the class in progress.

This place seems to be quite real to me, although I could just be seeing the reflection of my consciousness. I did go there very frequently, and I saw that many other people do as well. Maybe it is real, I just don't know.
<br>
<br>
It's so funny to consider when thinking back upon all the thousands of varied experiences I had during my sleep life. There are so many, and all so different, and all so real...

Yep, your experiences will follow along much the same lines as others who are now starting to "come together" as a result of websites such as these.
<br>
<br>
Please continue to talk about them, Jeffrey, because they give help and hope to those who have yet to experience such phenomena.
<br>

Yours,
