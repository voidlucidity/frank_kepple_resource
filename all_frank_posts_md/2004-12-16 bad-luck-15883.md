Can somebody give me suggestions to relax and quiet my mind? I've almost astraled but then my mind gets all weird and I lose my concentration. I use the "rope" method. What are some things you can do when you astral? I'm new here I just need a little help.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
The best way of going about this, IMO, is to follow the concept of "focus". In the sense of where you focus your attention becomes your reality.
<br>
<br>
Many people get the idea they somehow have to quieten their thoughts as a part of the relaxation process. Problem is, it is very difficult to "not think" about something. Like, to not-think about thinking. The way around this, is simply to focus away from your thoughts by mentally focusing your mind on something else. Think of a pleasant scene, engage your senses in that scene and become immersed in it. In doing this you will
<i>
 automatically
</i>
focus away from the physical.

Frank do you suggest any form of hemi-sync or sound file to help you focus ?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I've made a few recommendations based on my own development in the Sticky-thread forum. Plus, there is a thread that has been made sticky in the Astral Consciousness forum, "Wave 1 and general Phasing questions", where I give a follow-up to my original Wave-1 Pointers post.
<br>
<br>
If you haven't done so already, have a read through those posts and if you want me to clarify anything for you then jot your questions down in a post to the "Wave-1 and general questions" sticky post in the Astral Consciousness forum, as it's probably a bit off-topic for this thread.
<br>
<br>
HTH

<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
