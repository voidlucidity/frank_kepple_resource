The author of the website is poking fun at religious cults and/or dogma.

Ha ha ha, I just read the whole thing again and I'm wetting myself. I came across this about a year ago and the satire is glorious, lol. I start laughing from the very first "Jesus", "cold air" and "math" at the top. By the time I get to the diagram of 4+4=10 and old Jesus blowing cold air, I'm off my chair. Then 1+2+3=5 and "do not pick up copper". It's a classic. A modern-day Monty Python.
<br>
<br>
The clincher, for me, is where he says, "and science cannot say it's not" because you cannot prove a nothing. It's pure satirical poetry.
<br>

I started to laugh so hard I couldn't breathe when it said Cold air=mountains, Mountains=triangle.

My favorite comedy is the Holy Grail, but I just saw the old BBC film Hitch Hikers Guide to The Galaxy and thought alot of that humor was brilliant.  I'm a sap for the intellectual British humor.

The intellectual Brit comedy is virtually all satire. Mainly taking the p*ss out of the government or the queen and the (so called) royal family. If not that then religion. It has me in stitches. The humour is the only thing I miss about England, well, apart from the fact that my woman lives there. We poke fun at those that claim to lead us all the time and they know it. England is not really a country. It's a club that you belong to. :)
