Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
I'm new to the forum.
<br>
<br>
Over the last few years I have begun more and more to consciously experience AP. Although as a child I thoroughly enjoyed my "flying" experiences, I have found that as I get older, read more, my fears have become stronger. I was very fearful when I consciously experienced full body vibrations one afternoon a few years ago, but when I "woke" fear turned into elation. I felt so happy!
<br>
<br>
About a month ago, while on vacation, I don't know if I was leaving or returning, I hovered over my body, and this was the first time that I saw myself - I woke in the morning feeling thrilled. I want to experience more.
<br>
<br>
Last night, as I was drifting, I began to see the tunnel. Funnily enough I asked myself: what is this tunnel of shapes? And instantly then realized I was about to leave my body and stopped myself out of fear. I was so mad at myself, I tried to stay awake, focus, and keep myself calm and began visualizing my protective fields around me. But that's all I remember. However I woke this morning feeling VERY emotional. I burst into tears and cried. It really shook me to wake up and begin to cry! I'm feeling delicate today.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know why this happened? Has anyone experienced feeling emotional?
<br>
<br>
Why am I feeling fear? I had so much fun as a child. However I must add, that even as a child with the good experiences I also experienced many battles, and I think past-lives - I would escape through windows, places, scenes, it wasn't pleasant. But I still continued to enjoy many fascinating and insightful travels.
<br>
<br>
The more I read the more I do understand that fear is a self-built condition - I know that I didn't have this before, so where am I going wrong now? I meditate as often as I can - practice positive visualization, cleansing and healing. But I also spend time reading, and often what I read frightens me. I feel that perhaps I'm alone in protecting myself against more powerful and darker forces.
<br>
<br>
For the record, I do drink alcohol - rarely, but I do, and I enjoy it.
<br>
I also smoke pot, every evening. I'm trying to give up. My healer has told me to stop many many times, but even though I do, over the years I have begun to consciously experience more. I'm also a little psychic and I have strong intuition. I realize that I could develop this more if I were to stop these vices. Anyway, I'm working on that! For now, I would appreciate some feedback.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
V.

Hi:

The above belief construct you have subscribed to is the root cause of your problem. Cancel your subscription to that construct and it will all simply go away.
