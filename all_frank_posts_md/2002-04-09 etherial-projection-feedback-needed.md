<section>
First, those who do not know what Etherial projection is: it is basicly an OBE within the confines of the physical world and thus "real time".  It is through "the emotional body" and closest to physical perameters, so it between an Astral and Physical consciousness.  Those who have projected, but fail to "move, see or feel sensation, while not knowing if they are sleep-walking or dreaming" where also in Etherial form.
<br>
<br>
...anyways, those who get what I am saying: I would like to know more about the How's and Why's of my projections.
<br>
I have recently come to realize that my OBE's where not all Astral, but Etherial, which explains the lack of freedom and surreality.  To keep things short, I'll list some common problems and situations and hope somebody can help me to better comprehend.
<br>
I concider myself well-experienced and have been able to help myself and many others, but there is so much more I want to understand.
<br>
<br>
-Very little sound.  While out, I notice it is like being in a tank of water, so all "sound" is eighther muted somewhat, or telepathic.  Anything "loud" would then be more intense.
<br>
-Little activity.  My projections, on the most part are still and peaceful, so it has been mostly myself and wandering the quiet streets and houses; "ghost town" would be accurate.
<br>
-Mud and darkness.  Another source said that the Etherial realm is sometimes dark and dank, like a basement; I have noticed that sometimes everything does seem painted black, or sub-terrainian.
<br>
-Failure to teleport, or move.  Reguardless of how much I struggle or concentrate or "believe," I have been stuck or limited, as if in the Physical.
<br>
<br>
The limitations had led me to believe that Astral projection was not as free as everyone said, but evidently, I was not in the Astral most the time!

Many of my outings started off as dark heavy misty and close to my body. For instance, first feeling paralyzed, sitting up half out of the body and looking around at my room (dark misty)sometimes a conscious blue light shaft in the room lighting up the lower astral environment. Now I'm outside, it's bright and beautiful, but something is different, this isn't my hillside, it's just a little different, this is too real to be a dream but I still feel like I'm in a body, it's a lucid dream I figure. I play...
<br>
I think the best experiences are those when two conscious individuals in transcendent state directly connect (not physically, think of it more like telepathic connection within meditation). I don't know if there is a more joyful experience. Outside of the constraints of time. It's a funny world, all these different layers superimposed on each other, usually invisible, at least to the gross senses.

Hi Solstice,
<br>
<br>
I too only project into the real time environment.  I seem to have a heavy astral body,(dense) movement is not very fast. And everything is quiet and peaceful, some sounds I do hear are more of an echo, as sounding like they are on the other side of a wall. If I'm anywhere near the physical body, I slowly am pulled towards it like a tractor beam. It takes some effort to get through a wall, but once I'm out of the bedroom, I pick up speed and that tractor beam has no effect.
<br>
<br>
Things do look muddy but I think mostly due to it being dark outside.
<br>
I've projected during the day and everything is lit up and fantastic.
<br>
Especially trees! Float up midway to one and look at the leaves, they look brilliant and glowing with energy, like each one has an aura!
<br>
<br>
But I am tired and need something new, I am now trying to open the higher astral planes. But to do that I need to change my vibration or frequency to a higher rate. I think I have a slow vibration, hense the dense astral body and real time projections.
<br>
<br>
With Robert's N.E.W. system we might shed this extra weight, or find a way of our own, good luck to both of us!

Hi solstice......ya a Robert Monroe person huh, what is that all about anyways.  They have like a series of tapes or something that supposed to give you enlightenment or something.....I don't know a little expensive for me.  They say alot of people have obe's during them but they can't guarantee it.  I don't know...whats it like? their course I mean.  Adios amigo. I need to find me a quote.

 Funny you should say that. Because despite having had hundreds of Astral experiences, I only learnt to project into the RT zone fairly recently and found the novelty very quickly wore off. The Astral is simply a MUCH more interesting place.
 <br>
 <br>
 I found the way to project into the RT zone is to just "flop out" of the Physical before the pre-projection vibrations had reached (what I had previously considered to be) normal projection intensity.
 <br>
 <br>
 When learning about projecting into the RT zone, I could not understand where people would write instructions such as "roll out of your Physical body", etc. Because, when I project into the Astral, it feels like I have been shot from a cannon! For some reason, that is how it as
 <u>
  always
 </u>
 been with me.
 <br>
 <br>
 Drag Racing used to be a big hobby of mine and, from that experience, I would say it is like accelerating from standstill to 100 mph in about 1.5 seconds. (The thought has often occured to me that Drag Racing could well have had a strong influence on my early obe practice.)
 <br>
 <br>
 Recently, I experimented with "taking off" at varying vibrational intensities. What I discovered, is there appears to be a "critical point" that you have to reach in order to project into the Astral proper. Otherwise, you simply flop back either into the RT zone or into the Physical.
 <br>
 <br>
 It seems like the "vibrational intensity" is the equivalent of your take-off thrust. A bit like a rocket where the thrust is what keeps it pointing and flying upwards. If it were to start running out of thrust, it would fly in a big arc and eventually nosedive into the ground.
 <br>
 <br>
 So now, if I feel the onset of vibrations and let them build in intensity very gradually, whilst thinking about a gentle side-to-side rocking motion, there comes a point where I roll out (or flop out, as I call it) into the RT zone.
 <br>
 <br>
 To reach the Astral, however, you must first let the pre-projection vibrations build in intensity... and
 <u>
  then
 </u>
 project.
 <br>
 <br>
 The intensity and/or frequency of the pre-projection vibrations can be "controlled" by simply thinking about them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Lie still and just let the vibrations wash over you for a while (I imagined that I was bathing in them). Feel them as normal, but you need
 <u>
  also
 </u>
 to "listen" to them. You should become aware that the vibrations are not just one frequency, but are composed of many different frequencies. Though it might take you a number of attempts before you can pick this out.
 <br>
 <br>
 I call this my "frequency of contact" with the Astral.
 <br>
 <br>
 You see, all the different regions of the Astral tend to resonate at a particular frequency and intensity. On the Physical we would say that a bar or nightclub had a certain "atmosphere" for example. But not only that, we do this subconcious "picking up the atmosphere" virtually anywhere and everywhere we go. The Astral is no different. In fact, on the Astral, the "atmosphere" of a place is very much more obvious than when in the Physical.
 <br>
 <br>
 What you need to develop is a mental balancing act between allowing the vibrations to build but, at the same time, you think about filtering out the lower frequencies.
 <br>
 <br>
 You already have this ability. It is
 <u>
  exactly
 </u>
 like when you are listening to music. You can choose just to mentally sit back and be enveloped by the whole sound, or you can choose to fix your attention on just one instrument or voice: even though there might be many different instruments and voices all sounding at once.
 <br>
 <br>
 We also use this ability when in a group of people who are all having many different conversations at the same time. By merely thinking about it, we can "tune in" to anyone (within a reasonable hearing range) and hear what they are saying to the exclusion of everyone else. Or we can "tune out" and listen to no-one in particular, just hearing the general hub-bub of the overall sound.
 <br>
 <br>
 At first, concentrate on allowing the vibrations to build in intensity. Then, when you feel your head is about to explode, mentally "let go". You should feel yourself whoosh off. Like someone just fired you from a cannon. Though, initially, you may experience what I call "spontaneous projection" into the Astral. This is where you project before you decided to mentally "let go". But, with practice, you will be able to hold-off projection until mentally saying the word go.
 <br>
 <br>
 For a brief moment, you might feel like you "blacked out" or that you are traveling at high speed through a dark tunnel, or such like. Then, next moment, you should find yourself within the Astral somewhere.
 <br>
 <br>
 Once you can control the vibrational intensity, practice controlling their frequency. You will find that taking off at varying levels of intensity and frequency, very much effects where, on the Astral, you end up.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
You mention your exit sensations feeling like moving from 0-100mph in 1.5 seconds. As I've posted before, that's exactly the same for myself, and I usually have conscious volition of exactly when to actually project. However, interestingly enough (or not!), despite having identical exit sensations to yourself, I've only ever projected directly into the RTZ! I have managed to get to the astral via the tunnel structure, but I've never projected directly to an astral plane.
<br>
<br>
It just seems odd that we can experience the same sensations but different results, and you say you've projected hundreds of times. In Astral Dynamics I get the impression that the exit sensation should feel like a continual *downward* falling sensation. How come some people (yourself and I included) feel an upward movement? Perhaps we should compare the specific exit sensations more closely, as I get the impression that the individual discrepencies have always been overlooked by projectors/researchers.
<br>
<br>

 I've had high-speed downward-falling sensations too. It's just that upwards is better with me. It seems like everytime I think of falling out (as opposed to shooting out) I end up underground somewhere totally unable to know which way is up. Seeing the inside of layer upon layer of Astral rock is the Physical equivalent of watching grass grow.
 <img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 I don't know exactly what determines either up or down. If I left it totally to chance I guess it would be 50-50 which direction I'd go. But now, if I find myself falling I think of slowing down. This puts a brake on the projection process. I then catch a hold on the vibrations, build their intensity, and shoot off. More often than not I'll go upwards this time. The feeling is that my head comes out first with "body" straight. I rotate as if there was a hinge on the soles of my feet. I estimate the angle through which I rotate is about 120 degrees. So I end up body straight, head first leaning at an angle of about 60 degrees to the floor.
 <br>
 <br>
 During this initial rotation phase there is a tremendous wrenching feeling. Like there was a rope attached to my upper body and the other end was attached to a powerful slingshot mechanism. The rotation and subsequent shooting off is a continuous movement. After initial take-off the feeling is of travelling upwards at about a 60 degree angle at several hundred miles per hour for around 2 or 3 seconds.
 <br>
 <br>
 When you say "identical" exit sensations: understand that during the experimentation I talked about in my previous post to the thread, the actual "exit sensation" did not change all that much. Reference where I say, "What I discovered, is there appears to be a "critical point" that you have to reach in order to project into the Astral proper. Otherwise, you simply flop back either into the RT zone or into the Physical."
 <br>
 <br>
 As I say, the "exit sensation" of the times when I did
 <u>
  not
 </u>
 make it to the Astral were more or less the same as the times when I *do* make it to the Astral. What I was changing was the vibrational intensity of the pre-projection vibrations. These I found had a *significant* effect on whether I reached the Astral or "flopped back" as I call it, into the RT zone. There appears to be some kind of critical-point or critial-level of intensity that the pre-projection vibrations must reach before projection to the Astral proper can be achieved directly following take off.
 <br>
 <br>
 When I say "flopped back" into the RT zone. I suppose that if I had no prior experience of projection into the Astral then I would just say that shortly after "take off" I projected into the RT zone. It's just that from my point of view, trying to reach the Astral and ending up in the RT zone feels like you "fell back" or "flopped back". But to yourself it no-doubt just feels like you projected into the RT zone as normal.
 <br>
 <br>
 So I think the reason why we both can, "experience the same sensations but different results" as you were wondering, is because the vibrational-intensity of our respective pre-projection vibrations is different.
 <br>
 <br>
 As regards experiences given in books, I think it's best not to take what is written too literally. Well, that's what I found. Everyone has a natural way of projecting. So the key thing to do, I feel, is to use books to grasp the basic principles and/or ideas and then use them to develop your own way.
 <br>
 <br>
 It could well be that someone can only project by "falling out" of their body. Someone else's "natural way" might be to take off. But that someone-else hasn't projected yet, so they do not know what their natural way is. But they read a book and get the idea that the
 <u>
  only
 </u>
 way to project is by falling out. So in taking what they read, literally, they end up working against their natural way of projecting and don't know it.
 <br>
 <br>
 The only obe book I've read in the last 10 years is Astral Dynamics. Which has given me a number of hints, tips and pointers that I've used to good effect. The big limitations of the book, for me, is due to the fact that the bulk of Mr Bruce's projection experience is into the RT zone. So, Astral-wise, it didn't offer me all that much. But from using pointers given to me by Mr Bruce's work, I did (finally!) managed to enter the RT zone. So that was a big bonus.
 <br>
 <br>
 BTW... What is a "tunnel structure"?

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
Don't have time to elaborate - the tunnel structure is one of the methods of reaching an astral plane from the real-time zone, similar to the plane entrance structure (on the back cover of AD), but "rolled up"
