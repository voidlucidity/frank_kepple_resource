Alright, I'm starting to lose hope. I've been trying to project for 3(maybe 4) years now. I know sometimes it takes this long but I've done everything right, I've kept calm, keep focused, didn't expect to do it, etc. I've tried so many methods and only had some real progress with one (it was posted here on the old forums, don't remember who wrote it). I need a method bad, something basically simple. Please help.

Have you tried Astral Dynamics or Mastering Astral Projection by Robert Bruce yet?
<br>
I haven't personally progressed beyond energy work myself-but that's because I'm a little lazy. I can feel chi/energy easily so it's immediate reward
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
. but the rest is harder feel. Having read the books however I suspect someone as dedicated as yourself should be able to learn the discipline and be projecting within a few months

Try the following for a few days....Perhaps 4 or 5. Its probably best to try it at the weekend ! (taking a nap in the afternoon isn't very popular with most businesses, hee hee...)
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Mark's patented* Jump-start to astral sight
</b>
<br>
<br>
eat light meals. no snack or junk food, no sweets or coca cola !
<br>
do strenuous physical exercise, enough to make you tired / sleepy e.g try running a few miles each evening.
<br>
don't drink alcohol.
<br>
<b>
 sleep for only a few hours at night, perhaps 3 or 4.
</b>
<br>
Have a short nap in the afternoon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is
<b>
 not
</b>
a method....but it may cause an involuntary projection after you awaken, or just some symptoms e.g. astral sight, arms floating from your body. At the very least, you'll have some very vivid dreams ! I reckon that this combination of exercise &amp; lack of sleep puts the mind slightly out of sync with the body, which occasionally gives you a window of opportunity to project.
<br>
<br>
My intention is not for you to practise this technique all the time !! Instead, I hope that you'll experience some OBE-related symptoms. This will then give you renewed hope, &amp; perhaps you will be inspired to continue practising, perhaps from Robert Bruce's new book. If not, give it a break for a few months and come back to it when you feel the time is right.
<br>
<br>
Kind regards
<br>

I would have thought that if you have been trying to project for 3 or 4 years that you'd know every method known to man by now.
<br>
<br>
What do you mean by "didn't expect to do it"?
<br>
<br>
Make sure you feel strong motivation or intent, don't just relax and see what happens. Ask yourself why you want an obe. Is it important to you? Try to psyche yourself up with strong reasons for having an obe and see if that helps.
<br>
<br>
How far have you got in the past? Have you ever felt exit sensations? Floating feelings, heavy sinking feelings, strong vibes etc?
<br>
<br>
I hope you have some success soon!!

<section>
Hmm, the same question is in my mind too.
<br>
<br>
What do you mean by "didn't expect to do it." Was that a typo? Because if you are truly performing all this while not expecting to do it, then you are basically getting what you currently expect. I thought if you would let us know what you have tried that gave you some results, then we could expand on that.

karnautrahl - No, I have never tried them, maybe I should lol.
<br>
<br>
clandestino - Thanks, i'll try that for a few days like you said.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, what I meant by "didn't expect to do it" was I didn't expect to do it, and I didn't expect to not do it, I was at a state of mind where I just don't really care if I do or don't.
<br>
<br>
I got preaty far in the past, I felt very floaty, strong vibes, heard a voice or two I think.
<br>
<br>
Hm...the 1 method that I got REALLY far on was the one where you:
<br>
<br>
1. Get a timer, set it for 5 minutes, try to fall asleep
<br>
2. After it goes off, set it for 10
<br>
3. then 15
<br>
4. Then 20
<br>
5. Then keep setting for 25
<br>
<br>
I edited this though, and made beeping noises and burnded them to a CD. I also just yesterday tried the "White Light(Or was it Tube?)" Method. I felt floaty but thats all.

<section>
Its possible that you need to work more on the core skills before attempting your projections.  Projection is dependant upon certain things, how much energy you can draw into your body, how physically relaxed you can get, and your meditation ability.  Maybe you should spend some time not actually trying to project, but solely practicing energy work and some mental discipline exercises/physical relaxation.  After a while of working on these and seeing marked success, you can try again to project, which might increase your chances of success dramatically.  But I don't actually know how advanced you are at these things, so if you're already very advanced in energy work and meditation, this might be a bad idea.

<section>
Well, I am disappointed as well in my progress. I have however put a lot of effort into it and haven't had much success. Perhaps if I tell you what I am doing, you might give me some insight.  Every night before I go to bed, I spend about an hour or so, relaxing, raising energy etc. I have some OBE tapes from Robert Monroe which I use along with meditation (attempting to meditate). Then, I go to bed and wake up at 3 in the morning. I lye down on the floor and do about 500 breathing, raise energy again.   Go back to bed and sometimes I feel some energy and or vibration and even have some quick dreams like OBE, but  don't seem to have any control of it. Once in awhile, I feel sort of having an OBE and even feel hands holding my hands in attempt to help me out but I don't seem to go anywhere. I haven't given up and plan on being consistent throughout this year to see if I improve. I have also gotten in the habit of writing my dreams down every morning.  Well, I hope you will give me some hints.
<br>

Thanks

<section>
Last night I had the weirdest experience. Before going to sleep, I spent over an hour doing my usual OBE exercises. I was raising energy and for the very first time, I felt my energy body responding. I felt motivated by it and continued my relaxation, breathing and raising energy.  At one point, I got up and decided to do a few things before going to bed. Even when I was walking and doing things, I felt the tingling sensation and vibration going on specially on my right foot. I decided to lay in bed and  wait to see if my body was going to explode.  A little later, I am in a sort of a dream like situation where I feel this presence pulling me back and I am battling it to free myself. It was a horrible sensation. Then, after I got myself somehow free, or so I thought, I started to feel a churning sensation in my torso area and felt as though my stomach or the whole torso had a ballon inside. I don't think I know how to describe this sensation but I know it was not pleasant. This somehow broke my relaxation and brought me back to reality. When awake, I felt as though I was out of fuel. My body wasn't as vibrant any more even though I still felt that tinginling sensation on my foot. When I managed to go back to seep, I had a nightmare. Well, this at least proved to me that the raising energy does  do something.  Perhaps anyone has had similar experience and can share some light.

<section>
How much sleep do you get per night, and do you feel rested? My best results come at times when I get too much sleep. I usually average 5-6 hours a night and although if I practice daily I do get OBE results, due to tiredness they are usually infrequent and of poor quality. Around 4 years back I went through a stage of nightly practice. I would go to bed at 10 pm (my average bedtime is 2-6 am so this is very early for me) feeling very awake. I would then proceed to first do physical relaxation exercises, then a form of body meditation, and then use triggers to put me into an equivalent F10 state (mind awake body asleep.) If I'm truthful my incident of OBE during these practice sessions were low (although I did experience a lot of other strange occurrences,) BUT, I started to experience a lot of spontaneous OBEs and a very high frequency of sleep paralysis on awakening which I would use to project.
<br>
Getting back to my 'too much sleep' comment. If I have a few hours more sleep than I am used to (around 8-9 instead of 5-6) I find I can easily enter LDs, or if I awaken I can easily bring about the vibrational state, leading to OBEs. Have you tried getting more sleep than you normally have?

<section>
Guys just HOW much energy do you have to raise to even begin this stuff? I've also been working with NEW for sometime now, and 2hrs most days is not unusual. It's usually strong enough to make me sweat even when it's cold. However regardless of the amount of energy work or the amount of attempted meditation nothing much changes in my dream world. At all.  It's pretty demotivating to find continous effort isn't bringing any reward.
<br>
<br>
What kept me doing NEW to start with was the immediate feedback to systematic training. Now however I don't feel I'm getting much further. It does just seem to be harder and harder to get any further. That's a serious demotivator big time.  Is it just me?
<br>
I have commented elsewhere that I feel I'm in a psychic cage. As in I cannot get any psychic senses or glimpses of more interesting realities. I'll elaborate elsewhere sometime. Just to say I've a frustrated experience of reality. Beyond energy work internally it just feels that the closed skeptic worldview is becoming slightly more in line with what I am managed to sense. Which is NOT what I want.

<section>
I've been trying to do more with energy since I was about 11, I read a lot of my mother's books on magic, hypnosis and other subjects. It was an accident that I became aware of being able to move "energy", but once I could I practiced a lot-even though it was in an instinctive and ad hoc manner. It took years before I realised it was more tactile than anything.
<br>
I also tried meditation, spells oh the list goes on. I'm now 27 and the only reason I haven't abandoned the field of the "paranormal" if you like, is the fact that I have been able to course healing to occur in a lot of people I've tried to work on. If it wasn't for that by now with the time I've put in I would have dismissed it all as nonsense to be honest.
<br>
As it is now, it seems to me that it's near impossible to me to go beyond moving a bit of energy. I've been practicing chakra work as well from the NEW system and have worked systematically. No matter how much time I spend on it nothing changes outside the practice. Inside the practice session it's just simple effort and sensation. I can always feel "chi" as heat/tingles and rushes. It's pretty consisten, no sense of blockages. But no psychic senses ever manifest, nor does my dream life change.
<br>
I hope people can understand my sheer frustration when I DO think about this consciously. Most of the time I ignore this issue and just practice what I can feel, but I do feel I'm locked into a boring level of reality that nothing I do changes.
<br>
Just as a side note-I have tried different drugs in my life, ecstacy, weed, LSD(once!) and varying doses of mushrooms, also Salvia.
<br>
Guess what? Only visual distortions at the very best. Slight tactile and balance issues. some emotional switches on one dose of mushies.
<br>
Regardless of dose, hallucination and other weird excrement doesn't happen. Yet another confirmation that I can't go "beyond". Very boring, very frustrating, very disheartening.
<br>
I would have tried the payote or ayausca ceremonies but money, and other things have stopped me now and I probably won't. Especially as I've not used anything more than some wine for 2 yrs now.
<br>
Basically to my subconscious I just have one reality and some dreaming reality. It's a flaming pain in the ****! LOL.
<br>
Sorry if my frustration is just coming through now. I don't let it out that much usually
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
so I hope people don't mind, and I hope my releasing this might help someone else too?

<section>
Karnautrahl,
<br>
<br>
My interest in OBE is that I wanted to know through personal experience if we are indeed more than our physical bodies. I know that this is a delicate area which requires a lot of effort, a very positive mental attitude and faith in myself.  This is more like playing a musical instrument. One has to spend thousands  of hours on a piano before he can play it well. Many a time you become frustrated and want to give up. However, the ones who succeed are the ones who never give up. This applies to anything we do in life.   But playing the piano is not for every one. Sometimes we have to seek to direct our efforts into something else if what we are doing is not getting anywhere.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes.

It is because you believe your body and you to be the same thing.  You are where your thoughts, daydreams, dreams, ... essence is.
<br>
<br>
You have already had many implicit obe experiences.... but while you 'try' to have an explicit experience, you allow your mind to paint you an illusion that you are attached to your body.   If you can't keep your mind quiet... try instead to think of yourself as a spirit enclosed in a vesel, i.e. your body.  Then stop thinking about getting out... simply think of being somewhere else or looking at your body... and it will be so.   When you project yourself somewhere... anywhere... you will soon come to see that the projection is not a conjuration of your mind, but is instead real, i.e. that you have already left your body and is looking at something in realtime.

Kiba, you are using Cube's method. He has, since the last time he has posted on here, expanded on this method and developed new methods. I suggest you check them out at
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.saltcube.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.saltcube.com
</a>
Do check the forums as well as he has extra tips. Especially check out the breathing part which is especially important in projection.
<br>
<br>
After checking that out check this method out:

<br>
Meditation and clairvoyance are 2 prerequisite skills to AP :
<br>
<br>
I suggest you start in a group .The energy is higher in a group making it much easier to project. Once you learn,  you can continue alone if you wish or work concurrently alone, in an open circle,and in a closed circle .
<br>
<br>
Group work also allows you to see and hear more of the OBE . The  guides and angels of others in the group work together as a team making  it easier for newbies to get the energy up to slip out for OBE. Find a group near you thru a spiritual church .
<br>
<br>
Or make a group of your own  to meet in a home . Choose only those that can prove they are already clairvoyant and that you can get along with. Sit weekly for an hour . 7 : 30 pm is a good time to meet . 5 to 12 people is a good group . Here is a link on how to form a development circle :
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.isd-dc.org/ISD-Wash/EDUCATION/CONTENT%20Development%20Circles.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.isd-dc.org/ISD-Wash/EDUCATION/CONTENT%20Development%20Circles.htm
</a>
<br>
<br>
1. sit in an arm chair ...a comfortable one
<br>
2. arms and legs uncrossed
<br>
3. palms up and barefoot
<br>
4. close your eyes
<br>
5. take three deep slow cleansing audible breaths
<br>
(down to your toes and out take your time then begin to breathe normally - breathe in light love breathe out negativity )
<br>
6.  sit in the power of the now
<br>
7 . bring your awareness to your third eye
<br>
(sit as a spirit in a room behind your forehead )
<br>
8. now bring your attention (with eyes closed still) to the ceiling and
<br>
think of floating up to the ceiling and do it .
<br>
<br>
Don't say you can't ...just do it .
<br>
<br>
I have taught many people this way . I have  seen so many doubters learn to do it in the first  session . You can see them come out clairvoyantly so you know whether they made it or not . If they can  do it so can you  .
<br>
<br>
Problems for first time projectors include :
<br>
a. coming right back to the body by opening eyes or by looking back at yourself sitting there
<br>
b.not knowing they are out and feeling and seeing nothing but the back of the eyelids
<br>
c. not having prerequisite skills to meditate or see clairvoyantly
<br>
d. falling asleep even sitting up so losing recall
<br>

<br>
nah mate you are right
<img alt=":oops:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/embarrassed.png" title="embarassed"/>
and I stand corrected ...I should have said that meditation and clairvoyance should be considered prerequisite skills  but we can always attempt AP without them . And maybe we will be successful ..... hmmmm
<br>
<br>
If we can walk in a dark room ....or stroll when we are blind , then surely humans can project and not see clairvoyantly yet . Perhaps there are humans who project open eyed and use only  the physical eyes  to see in spirit .
<br>
<br>
I have a mate who is trying this . I will let you know how he gets on . He trances open eyed and channels open eyed and well before this thread he had set out to determine how much of the spiritual realm he could see with eyes wide open . So far he has to go open and closed and slip in and out of the realm this itself is hard enough . In fact he regularly teases me to open my eyes saying when I go to the shop do I try to buy without looking at the labels on the cans ? Can I feel which can I want ? ...hmmm I love a valid well constructed argument but he hasn't made it yet as I see in 3D colour with eyes closed and he sees like silver auric outlines without colour .So of course we have friendly debates on this one .
<br>
<br>
And surely we all can project without being able to meditate when we are children we are taken to astral by angels and guides . But can we consciously project when and where we choose and not be able to meditate yet ? I don't  think so .  I am not sure if it happens . But although there is a predictable continuum of human spiritual development , there always will be those exceptions to the rule .
<br>
<br>
Thanks  for that reflection . Rethinks are good mind candy too

<br>
Well developing clairvoyance is not difficult either . All humans can do this . I work now in the real world as a teacher of multiple challenge students . It still amazes me how my students project themselves to my circle in my home . They have never been to my house in real life they just rock up and smile at my circle . And a member of circle will say do you have a girl with black curly hair and glasses that wears special gloves on her hands . I never get over this ?? Yeah there she is and then everyone looks and sees this kid floating there in a lotus  bizarre . My students can not speak or walk in this world they are profoundly cognitively impaired but the higher self is always perfect . If a blind child of 12 years with spina bifida that is wheel chair bound in nappies can project a full apparition to my lounge room when she wants to mate then you can do it too .
<br>
<br>
Again the energy in a circle is higher and it is easier to see and to hear spirit within a development circle . We can also confirm each other experiences and this helps tremendously .  Most spiritual churches have a free open one that anyone can drop into once a week . The circle opens in prayer , has a meditation then some clairvoyant exercise and/or a psychic exercise and then closes in prayer . The teacher leads the lesson there is usually meditation music and a guided meditation .
<br>
<br>
When students become good enough they can be invited into closed circles where  5 to 12 members sit in the same chairs at the same time each week . This is like making an appointment with your guides and angels and welcoming the specialists in .Then there is no music and the lesson is provided by the teacher in spirit who rocks up . They have a sequential syllabus with lesson plans according to our abilities ,our questions, our topics of interest and our particular path .
<br>
<br>
Beyond our own guides and angels there are master teachers in spirit who teach across the world called chohans or mahatma . They are the ones that rock up when we sit at a higher vibration level of energy and we can all get there . They don't charge a fee and they do show up in all languages and curltures right round the world . We communicate clairvoyantly until we develop clairaudience and then channeling .
<br>
<br>
Then there are gatekeeper and doorkeeper angels that work in pairs to protect and assist the closed circles . Usually the alpha male angel of the group becomes the gate keeper and can be seen at the top of the circle above the roof clairvoyantly shifting  the energy deosil to close  the vortex of passage after the members of the circle have projected . The doorkeeper is often female and she opens the door to other realms with a widdershins sweep of her hands  . so we project she opens we leave he closes . To have the higher energy angels working in pairs to assist us we have to have group dynamics . We have to have blended our energies from our own subtle bodies to reach a vibratory level that warrants such assistance . And it is early in the path .
<br>
<br>
The development of the circle helps each member to move along this way . The higher the energy of our mates the easier it is for us to feel see hear . And the more we feel see hear the higher the energy of our subtle bodies vibrations so that we can go go longer see more and recall more . This allows the time and energy it requires to see the teachers learn the lessons and bring it back to conscious recall and move on .
<br>
<br>
Once we develop sufficiently we can manifest a group merkaba and travel to spiritual realms together so that we clairvoyantly see in unison . You can see the higher self of your mates in circle or see the real time projections of them there on the realm . So that if you project and a mate is away , absent , the higher self is usually the form we see looking so much younger fitter and noble lol . But if the physical body is in the circle then we see projection wearing clothes like they are in that day with all the fat from middleaged bodies just hanging there too lol .
<br>
<br>
The importance then of group work is to sustain the higher energy and to develop more quickly and to reach the higher levels necessary to eventually manifest your own vortex and travel to realms alone to explore see and hear the messages of those we meet in the realms . It is exciting to speak to live projectors and hear them it can happen .
<br>
<br>
At our level now we do not use telepathy to each other much we dont send images of what we see and hear to each other I mean . We need to get there .  We do get the stimulus from the room and from the teachers and then we give it off . This means we have to slip in and out or better yet trance and give it off . So we are sitting ,  we project into the vortex together we say what we see and hear and feel to the group the others respond if they can to confirm and build up the experience . Then we travel along see and hear and give off again . We explore for about an hour 3 times a week . What happens after the AP , OBE , Merkaba , Group Merkaba , Vortex , I dunno
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
<br>
<br>
For example my circle is on a universal path of enlightenment and we celebrated the snake and dove initiations together and now we are on another level where we have manifested a metaphysical college in spirit and we have been assigned teaching roles . So we are learning how to teach dead and live students that come to our individual class each night .
<br>
You can't always tell who is alive and who is dead though we should be able to lol There are slack lazy students who lie on pillows and sleep as Jodi teaches psychic development and frenetic hyper students that seem like Chihuahuas on speed learning spiritual defense with Bill . And every one in between . We project through walls and backwards through floors it is fun to work as a ghost lol. We don't get paid . We don't get charged a fee either . It is the most exciting thing we have done in OBE so far . We had to manifest our own ashram ,that was cool, this is better .
<br>
<br>
Do I think it is worthwhile to learn ? Mate I cannot think of anything on this earth that I have enjoyed more than this cerebrally speaking . It is the mind lollies . Get out there and do it .
<br>
<br>
We are all students and teachers of each we meet on the path .

Greets,

<br>
My name is Alex...though you can call me whatever you please. Most choose to go with Xia. I'm a friend of Kiba's, and I've been working on projections about as long as he has...4 years roughly. I've had a few unintentional projections, though they were short and I'm not entirely sure they weren't dreams..I've tried countless methods, and had no luck at all with intentional projection. I'm really starting to wonder why I can't do this..I should've by now, without doubt...I believe I may be missing something, or overlooking something important to succeed. Either way, I'm starting to get discouraged.
<br>
<br>
Anyway...I don't know what to do next, and I hope to continue learning here. You all seem pretty helpful, and I think everyone here can help us learn to project intentionally.

<br>
What to do next ? hmmmm
<br>
<br>
Have you tried a group development circle yet ?
<br>
<br>
also I suggest :
<br>
READ :
<br>
plan to spend some time
<br>
just after you wake before you eat anything
<br>
take a glass of water with you and read
<br>
this is the best time to absorb info
<br>
relaxed pull up a comfortable chair
<br>
at the computer with  a hassock under  your feet
<br>
sit uncrossed barefoot
<br>
no distractions in the quiet of the morning
<br>
<br>
1. search this forum :

Practice energy body awareness from these techniques they are
<br>
the best I have seen on this planet lol . The energy body is what we use to perceive in spiritual realms don't neglect it .

</a>
<br>
there are 30 techniques listed there click a link  and give it a go
<br>
<br>
there are so many methods
<br>
find the one for you
<br>
we are all the same
<br>
but
<br>
we are all different
<br>
both not either
<br>
<br>
I do not advocate lying in bed alone at the beginning of this process
<br>
when you are learning technique that is far too hard
<br>
for most to accomplish without falling asleep
<br>
try sitting in a group first
<br>
then sitting alone
<br>
then lying in your bed when you have the hang of it
<br>
bed is natural
<br>
and we all do project here with help from angels and guides
<br>
each night as a child
<br>
but there comes a time when they want us to do it ourselves
<br>
and when we also want to do it ourselves
<br>
we do
<br>
<br>
and when we can master projecting with recall
<br>
from the relaxed sleep state position
<br>
it is awesome
<br>
so do keep going
<br>
don't be satisfied ever
<br>
keep learning
<br>
eternal student and eternal teacher
<br>
<br>
this is what i teach newbies :
<br>
<br>
seek to join or form a closed circle of peers
<br>
open with a prayer of protection (ie White Light  )
<br>
sit in meditation in chairs in the closed circle at 730 pm once a week
<br>
eyes closed
<br>
palms up
<br>
feet bare
<br>
limbs uncrossed
<br>
3 deep cleansing breaths in your own time
<br>
then begin to breathe naturally
<br>
bring your consciousness to the third eye
<br>
see yourself as spirit
<br>
small and light as air
<br>
in this room of your consciousness
<br>
behind your forehead in the  third eye
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: violet;">
 dwell in the now and sense
 <br>
 watch the visions come and go
 <br>
 do not react or question
 <br>
 just silently observe
</span>
<br>
(after mastering this the meditative state
<br>
then skip the violet bit here
<br>
but do the same thing as above just adding  this next step below )
<br>
lift your self up from the body
<br>
visualise yourself rising up like smoke up to the ceiling .
<br>
<br>
I suggest looking
<br>
meet the others in the class on the roof
<br>
(don't look back to see self in chair btw or open eyes it brings you home to your body try those fun things later once you master the basics )
<br>
and follow the leader
<br>
then follow your heart when you go alone
<br>
then become the leader
<br>
when you learn it
<br>
share it
<br>
teach it
<br>
shine
<br>
<br>
it is much easier to accomplish projection in a group
<br>
once you master group projection
<br>
going it alone is easy
<br>
<br>
If you have that down
<br>
keep learning
<br>
there is always something new to learn
<br>
don't ever stop the journey
<br>
and become complacent
<br>
<br>
begin to travel on a group merkaba
<br>
it is faster and easier to see and hear then
<br>
after you have mastered that
<br>
try flying your own merkaba where you will
<br>
<br>
then open the vortex with your circle
<br>
then open it alone
<br>
this is as far as i know for now lol
<br>
<br>
if you are past that then help me to find the next step  lol
<br>
<br>
So go back to basics with your  AP efforts :

Hi Kiba and Xia,
<br>
You could try the simple and effective projection method I use with clients...  it works very well for the beginner or the old hand.
<br>
<br>
You can find it by clicking on the link below to my Geocities Home Pages, then click on the Spiritual link, then the one called White Light Method.
<br>
<br>
Try it every day for 30 days to see how it will work for you, and even modify it to suit yourself as you get better results with it.
<br>
<br>
Some members here are using it and report good results from their first attempts... don't be discouraged by slow growth if it happens that way, it just means more practice is required.
<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.
<br>
<br>
Love Always.
