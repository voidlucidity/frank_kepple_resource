I have discovered that if I have a glass of wine or two before I go to sleep I will hardly ever dream or have an Astral Projection.  If I do this for say five days in a row and on the sixth day do not, Well Watch out because its if the brain tries to release so many emotions that have been suppresses during this time.  I will have perhaps 20 or 30 vivid dreams in one night possibly accompanied by a valid projection.  It's as if the mind does not function properly with the higher self under the influence of alcohol.  I do not smoke or do other drugs and can only compare alcohol to how it interferes with dreams and projections.  Even if I have a dream after alcohol consumption it's very non lucid or a projection would be to the so called Lower Planes. I would be interested if others have found a similarity.

There have been studies that show that if people are deprived of REM Sleep, that is, of Dreaming, that they will eventually HAVE TO dream even if it involves hallucinating while awake.
<br>
<br>
And I have read that alchohol consumption does dampen dreaming somewhat, though I did not know it to such a great degree.  I myself have a glass of wine in the evening.  I suppose I will have to give it up for awhile and see what happens.

I'm beginning to come to the belief that alcohol is a serious inhibitor to successful continuous projection.

In my experience, a definite yes, and I no-longer drink the stuff. Not that I ever drank that much anyway but I have had my moments! But even 2 or 3 glasses of wine over the course of an evening would seriously impair my projection abilities the next morning.
<br>
<br>
I would only drink socially about once a week on average, so it didn't hamper my progress all that much. I stopped doing it mainly because it was just some dumb social habit I'd got into. One day I thought, this is weird, every now and again I get together with a bunch of friends, we have a chat and administer poison to ourselves. I saw myself doing it and thought how ridiculous, and I haven't touched a drop since.

Personally I find that it just blocks me from doing any energy/OBE work.
<br>
<br>
Also stops me from sleeping, which is very annoying.

Alcohol definetly makes remembering dreams and projection alot harder.
<br>
After being drunk and waking up the next day, I can't remember jack schitt about what happened during my sleep.
<br>
<br>
So drinking alcohol and projection do not go together with ease.

Yes, I have not had a drink all this week and find that my dreams are much more vivid and I am on the brink of projection on several occasions.  It's easy to fall into the trap of alcohol and for alot of people hard to stop once they have drank for many years. I awoke this afternoon and saw a purple mist that was forming by the bedroom window.  Really kind of freaked me out as it was really there and was not SP.

A question. Like you I have also stopped drinking. I feel a lot better but still......some of my most memorable WILDS happened in the morning after a nights drinking with a very strong hangover. I still cant quite understand this. It also seems that my OBEs have somewhat stopped now I live a cleaner life, maybe I am focusing too much on the physical.
