I would like to hear you talking about little things that make you happy and that can give you pleasure. Be original and say ideas that are not common. I am talking about little things, not the "heavy"/"strong" pleasure that sex can give you or radical sports...nothing like that.
<br>
<br>
Let me give some ideas and things that i may use for myself (many of them are normal things):
<br>
- be sitted in a sofa in front of a fireplace in a rainy and cold day.
<br>
- look into the clouds
<br>
- give a calm ride in bike, near the river in my home
<br>
- close my eyes and imagine that i am in very nice place. This is particulary good in rainy days and when you went into the bed
<br>
- just sit somewhere and take some sun in my body
<br>
- read a "colorfoul" book, like Lord of the Rings in a stormy day. This is stupid but sometimes i love to read the chapter of "Tom Bombadil" (in a bad day) and then went into the bed (when i am going to sleep) and imagine that i am in the nice house of Tom.
<br>
<br>
ok, these ideas are not original, and some of them are very stupid and related with cold days(yeap, in Portugal it is a cold weather now), but i would like to hear more.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I like to take the top off my little sports car and drive it around the twisty mountain roads we have here in southern France. Some of the views are just awesome. Plus loads more, including, watching the sunset in the winter as the red light reflects off the snow-capped mountains. Walking by the waterfall close to my home. The sight and smell of the lavender fields in the autumn. Swimming in the lake in the summer. Walking by the gorge... the list goes on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

- now that you speak about nature, i remember another thing: i love to walk into the deep forest in the mountains with my friends. At 1 month ago we went into the mountain (not exactly a "mountain" more like an intermediary sate between that and an hill). Its very nice to walk in the forest (not normal woods) and see only thousands of trees, plants, etc.
<br>
<br>
In one of the moments we were walking, we found a lsmall rivulet with silver water, not very deep, running across no where. Everything was very greeny and we just sit near that place, eating and enjoying the sun. I cannot describe the place very well, due to my english, all that i can say its that it was amazing, like a cozy place in the middle of the forest.

I love to see my cats playing with something and knowing that they're ok. It gives me a good feeling.

Music! Listening to or writing music make me happy.
<br>
So does sitting outside and reading a book, or playing guitar, or just sitting outside and looking at the trees and stuff.
<br>
My cat makes me happy too.

Hmm... I'm not sure I have many little things that give me pleasure. There is no nice scenery here. But there is the pleasure of a new idea - a little thought that makes everything else fit into place. I can get quite addicted to that.*
<br>
<br>
But my pleasures are mostly strong (but not
<i>
 radically
</i>
strong, like in the cases you mentioned). I take pleasure pretty seriously. ;)
<br>
<br>
Long, arduous hours of drawing and art. Intense pursuits in self-directed teaching. Athletics and running (when it's not so incredibly cold!).
<br>
<br>
And, of course, after a long day... a night of successes in astral projection! ;)
<br>
<br>
But all that is hard to do. Maybe I take pleasure too seriously. lol

*Which is why, if you're reading this BillionNamesofGod or JoWo, I wasn't entirely satisfied after the "getting it" feeling after reading Quantum Metaphysics. I'd like to continuously practice it, which the two of you seem relatively uninterested in, satisfied in your idle bliss.

Pure heaven..

<br>
I think nature is the biggest one for me, not in a crowded park with a bunch of people, just my kids and hubby.  I'm quite proud of how my kids react to nature as I do..it makes it that much more enjoyable to share it and they don't mind being quiet and just soaking it allll in..ahhh...yep, can feel it now.

Shaving I find only makes it worse. Far better waxing in my opinion. I have someone who comes around to the house every 5 or 6 weeks, but failing that I've heard the home waxing kits are very good nowadays.

I enjoy doing a hike up the hill/slash mountain a little distance from my house. when your up there you secluded from all of man. The wind flows freely with not obsticles to divert its ongoing flow. Often when I look up I see a pair of hawks catching the breeze rising and dropping. Sometimes when I get up the at the right time I see a vast mélange of colors reflecting of the clouds as well as the suns setting light resting on the ocean water. That gives me much joy.
