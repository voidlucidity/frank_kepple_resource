<section>
For the past 2 - 3 years I have pretty much been celibate.  Part of that has to do with the fact that I went through a terrible break up and that I moved halfway across the U.S. and another part of it has to do with the fact that I was just extremely nervous around girls and was very not thinking myself to be at a place where I was responsible enough to be in a relationship and another part is that I was seriously trying to follow a spiritual path.
<br>
<br>
The thing is that these sexual urges don't go away.  I mean, I'm a human being for gee goly's sake.  And now I've spent the past almost 3 years supressing my sexual energy so that I'm at a point where it is locked down most of the time and now and again it just explodes out in an uncontrollable manner.
<br>
<br>
I guess my main concern is that I've noticed recently that having this energy turned off in a way has had an adverse effect on my energy level.  My problem is how do I get this energy flowing again but yet still be able to control it so I don't find myself having to masturbate 12 times a day...

<img alt=":oops:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/embarrassed.png" title="embarassed"/>
and more importantly, I don't want to be walking around zapping all the females I come across with that energy and it's really bad when this energy explodes out of me and men are near...  heh, not so comfortable for them either.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for any input

Neglecting a part of you is not healthy, which should be rather oblivious from the unbalanced state this has left you in. First let me say that it is not because you have not had sex in 3 years, but because you have suppressed a part of you. I don't have time at the moment to repeat things I have repeated many times before on here, so do a search on this subject with me as the author if you wish. Also I highly recommend you read (and practice) the book
<i>
 The Multi-Orgasmic Man
</i>
by Mantak Chia. This will help you become balanced again and deal with your sexual energy in a positive and healthy way. Here is a link to the book:

You say one of the reasons you were celibate was that you were seriously trying to follow a spiritual path. Could you let me know what that particular path is so I can avoid it! lol

3 years, gosh, that's a long time without the curvy stuff. Time to get decked out and on the razzle methinks.

Hi Halphased,
<br>
<br>
Here are some advices based on my personal experience.
<br>
<br>
Indeed, being human and having a healthy sexuality is important. It is related to being grounded, which is in my opinion a step to be fulfilled along your spiritual path.
<br>
<br>
Masturbation is a terrible energy loss : it deprives you of some electric fluid that should go up along the above energy centers.
<br>
<br>
When you have sex with a woman, the magnetic fluid that she looses get inside your lower chakras, and your electric fluid goes inside her aswell, so you see, both of you get some energy exchanged -- and if you turn her on a lot you might actually gain some energy lol.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... you needa find some girl, and you have two different options :
<br>
<br>
1- The Mr. Everybody Way : you learn how to behave as an earthly human being, you go in nightclubs, approach girls and do it the harsh way like everyone else. If you have too many inner blockings and if you are too shy, then get a job and offer yourself an NLP therapy in an institute next to you. Otherwise learn self-hypnosis and NLP all by yourself. Here is a golden link :
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.fastseduction.com/youarenew" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.fastseduction.com/youarenew
</a>
to give you some motivation.
<br>
<br>
2- The "Psychic" Way : you learn about Mind Power, or if you're really serious about it, you learn Hermetics, and you get yourself your dream girl after months or years of study. Search "Mind Power" and "Mind Power Seduction" ebooks in Kazaa for the easy way, or start reading Franz Bardon books for the latter.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps

ok then i will never ascend cuz i've never been "with "a girl .hell i haven't been around a girl(talking to one ect ect) in 4  years(i'm 21)
<img alt=":o" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
<br>
<br>
hm i don't masturbate too i think that kind of action is a bit humiliating for a human being but that's just my opinion
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
now talking more concretelly about myself.
<br>
<br>
i'm a very nervous guy and  when i say nervous I MEAN NERVOUS .i became nervous  around girls or any other odd situation apart  from my daily stuff . my body starts shacking really hard  sometimes i can't even talk.
<br>
<br>
well, i guess and i feel it in my heart that it's not destined to me  in this life time to "be" with a girl" or a boy ^_^ oh darn it maybe  i was a  don juan in a previous life and now i'm paying for it
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
.
<br>
<br>
anyway even if i managed to get lucky O_O i think i would turn it down because i don't like "used" things and at my age i don't think i'll find a virgin girl unless she's damn ugly lol. yeah  i know this is a bit macho man  sue me hehehe.
<br>
<br>
i think sex is not that important. is just a mean to procriate so the race does not die.yes i guess it generates energy but so does all activities.
<br>
the human race gives too much enfase to it.
<br>
<br>
everywhere you look  like in the television you see sex channels ,love movies you can't change a channel without seeing people kissing lol. in the television adds, you see girls almost naked taking a bath giving publicity to a determined bath oil or
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///whatever.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 whatever.you
</a>
go down the street you look up what do you see? huge bright slogans with beautiful women wearing lingerie.or a more common thing you go over the street and all you see is girls wearing tinny skirts,tops,thongs ect ect doesn't this generate stressfull energy between the teenagers? if it does on adults imagine it on the teenagers and children lol :].
<br>
<br>
the music scene  the lyrics, video clips ect all you see you don't even pay attention to the singers  or the music you only look at the hot girls the video has. i suspect musicians add girls to they're video clips to supress they're lack of talent
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
oh music lyrics always the same subject
<br>
love. well love cannot exist without sex,so the music is about sex.
<br>
<br>
in hip hop,rappers ect the idea of sucess is loads  of cash and  girls worthy to be playboy playmates around them 24/7 the message they point out the the young ones is  if you have money you have all the girls you want they're indirectlly calling whores to the female race because if you accept money to be with a person you are a hoe.
<br>
<br>
sex gives too many problems to mankind and you can see the results.
<br>
like one of them is there are just  too many people on the planet for example  china has a  population of 1.6 bilion India got a population of 933 millions
<br>
<br>
this is the century of sex.
<br>
<br>
well,i could continue to develop my point of view but gee my text is already gigantic and I'm tired
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
to sum it up a bit I'm not a Christian nor do i have a religion but i guess in a priest way of viewing the subject i would go to heaven O_O

I doubt whether you would need to masterbate 12 times a day.  12 times a month would probably be enough to take the edge off so that you could be tension free enough to still be a perfect gentleman with the ladies.
<br>
<br>
I noticed that when I began to volunteer with stray cats and adopted a few very well socialized companion cats, I was no longer so eager to put myself to go places where I could meet women.  I suppose at a certain level we date more for company and companionship then we do for sex, providing that the sexual tension is released often enough.
<br>
<br>
So get a dog or a couple of cats.  Have your happy little family.
<br>
<br>
And don't be embarrassed about masterbation.  There is a story about the Philosopher Diogenes the Cynic.  He was criticized for masterbating in broad day light right in the center of the Town Square.  He said, "what!? why be shocked that I satisfy an appetite.... that I scratch an itch.  I only wish I could satisfy my hunger by rubbing my belly".
<br>
<br>
But after that, get a pet.  Remember that they are not as demanding as women.  Women have complicated and demanding agendas.  You will find you either have a new boss whom you must answer to, or you will be driven to becoming controlling in order to prevent yourself being controlled.  Cats are much easier.

Ha, you guys probably know this, I woke up on Monday and I can relate to your suppressed urges. Just this Monday I met my opposite (We where instantly attracted to each other) love at first sight (or was it?)Then on Thursday I was convinced I could have any women I laid my eyes on. I spent that day chatting to pretty ladies and giving those Harry Potter rings, I assured them I wouldn't give them the rings unless they kept them forever. (Funny if you tell someone they can't have something they want it.)
<br>
<br>
Then around 8:00pm me and my friends where in a bar and I went over to chat to some more ladies, I explained the situation about the rings and they where happy to take them. After I had just finished chatting with these ladies their friends came into the bar and we all started chatting. If I found myself previously in this situation surrounded by ladies I would have just curled up and died. However on Monday I found myself and the confidence, however I seriously messed up this conversation, After giving the rings away I was convinced that I was meat to marry one of the ladies her name was Laura, I pointed at her and exclaimed you're my wife! Can I have your number! This must have been a bit unsettling; she pointed to my ring on my finger and asked for it. I got this ring on my birthday, its labradorite and I was guided to it and planed to keep it the rest of my life, however due to my misplaced lust I immediately took the ring off and through it to her, she didn't know what to do, and she couldn't believe what was happening. She began to walk away I stood in her path and got on my knees and begged for her number, I kissed her shoes told her I worship the ground she walks on. She said that she would give me her number if I kissed my mate, I was only to happy to oblige, and yes I touched his tong, but I don't care he's me buddy and I think I can control my leap on lady urges now.
<br>
<br>
Yep I have her number. I rang her and she asked me about the rings, I can't remember what I said, I couldn't tell her that I only woke up on Monday. She called me a freak. Which brings me to this point why would she give a freak her number?
<br>
<br>
How confusing sorry about the rant but it's off me chest now
<br>
<br>
I am free woohooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<br>
<br>
Thankyou everyone I love you all

In my old youngbuck days I noticed the same phenomena that Birdman noticed -- that success with one lady seems to energize the entire sexual aura, and suddenly where you thought you would be lucky to have just one lady friend, suddenly you are in a position to make choices.
<br>
<br>
What typically happens, though, is that you move up to a Higher League, where again you begin to consider yourself lucky to have just one lady friend -- the advantage being that she would not be as much of loser damaged-goods fat pig as before.

This has been interesting reading.
<br>
<br>
I was surprised that given the nature of this forum, there was no discussion about astral projection in combination with sexual suppression and/or masturbation.
<br>
<br>
sigh.  Or it could be that this has been discussed in detail before and my ignorance of the forum is showing  . . . again.
<br>
<br>
Still . . . a couple of comments on the original topic.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been my experience that if you work to support your own lifefulness and the level of life energy of the world around you, that everything -- even sexual suppression -- works to move you to a higher energy level.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes sexual suppression is about hidden wisdom.  Creating an energy imbalance can move us through blocks.  Also, the univese has a particular interest in vacuumes.  Aware longing draws us to whatever we are lacking.
<br>
<br>
That's the point where masturbation becomes just another interesting factor in the equation.
<br>
<br>
If at some level you have been celibate to create a greater opening in yourself, for growth and to draw a more perfect lover into your life, sexual release of any kind can be unhelpful . . . or it might just be the right time for a shift.
<br>
<br>
Then, there is the way we interact in community -- both materially and astrally.  I have had a handful of powerful friends throughout my life who appear to be sexually obsessed -- and yet rarely have lovers.  Psychology fills libraries with writing on this subject, but energetically these people run around "waking up" the dormant sexual energies of everyone else.
<br>
<br>
I tend toward sexual repression myself.  Yet, it's become rather obvious to my friends who work so hard in the "meet and greet" mating networks that when the Universe feels that it's time for me to have a lover, it happens.  Twice can be coincidence, but in my last three relationships (yes, I'm OLD so that makes for lots of years of opportunity!) the right man just appeared out of nowhere, at my door, with no effort on my part.  One of them claimed that I pulled him out of Presbyterian seminary half a continent away.
<br>
<br>
I don't practice sexual magic -- but I do work on my own physical/emotiona/psychological/energic stuff all the time.  Much of that involves cycles of abundance and appararent lack -- I have at long last come to realize that it's the place where the sea meets the shore that has the greatest lifefulness and I'm learning to work with the void as well as the manifest.
<br>
<br>
Not to interrupt and interesting line of talk, guys, but I thought perhaps a few words might open up some lines from people who know a lot more than I do in these areas.
<br>
<br>
Safe journey

Dear Chimerae
<br>
<br>
The problem between men and women is that we simply do not know each other's experiences.  For instance, women talking about the horrible tortuous trevails of giving birth.  But for all men may know, it might just tickle and that women are being vast whimps about it.
<br>
<br>
so when a woman says that she can prefer not to masterbate in order to have a vacuum that will help draw her toward a relationship, many men would find this incomprehensible.  After two days most men would begin to start humping the pews in Church.  Sexual tension is not a polite thing to walk around with in one's pocket.  It also tosses off the judgment.  One begins pay attention to women one ordinarily would find invisible, or possibly would even avoid.
<br>
<br>
It is even mentioned quite often that women suppose men are thinking with their genitalia, and what they mean is that recognize that a build up in sexual tension influences a man's judgment.    It does.  I think a man owes it to the community he lives in to keep that kind of thing discretely under control.
<br>
<br>
Many of the Religious Monastic Traditions have stories about the heroic efforts their Saints made in establishing themselves in perfect celibacy.  But these efforts consist in systematically malnurishing oneself, or in diverting the body's resources into healing self-inflicted epidermal injuries from selfmutilation and flogging.  I think it should be easier and healthier to simply glance over the "Swin Suit" issue for a few minutes every other day or so.
<br>
<br>
One of the best literary treatments I have seen on this problem was in Herman Hesse's "Demian".  You know, Hesse was at one time very popular in the franchise bookstores, but now I hardly ever see his works.  Very interesting novels for those on the verge of spirituality.  Of course everyone could see how his "Siddhartha" would apply, being about Gautama Buddha, but all of his novels have something of a spiritual streak.  But I read them so long ago that I wonder whether they could hold up well to my developed knowledge and tastes.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have never been able to establish a correlation between sexual deprivation and spiritual experiences -- having Visions in Meditations or having Lucid Dreams.   The Ancient Wisdom is that sexuality uses up resources that the body would ordinarily use for Spirituality, but, again, this may be because it has always been a tacit tradition to keep Monks half starved.   The Ashram and Monastery Managers would over the years see exactly how much food was necessary to maintain life at the most basic subsistence level, and knowing this, would not feed anybody even a grain of rice more than that bare minimum.   So, ofcourse, the individuals subjected to this regimen would have to prioritize their allocations of energy.  But non-institutionalized people with sufficient disposable income scarcely have that problem and may eat well enough to provide for both sexual energies and spiritual energies, and that by depriving one, you will not necessarily have more of the other.

<br>
<br>
Leo,
<br>
<br>
It is different for women . . . not just the experience and energetics of sex but some of the other energetic experiences as well.
<br>
<br>
Having agreed there, the "working with unmet lust" as a technique for spiritual expansion and growth was something I learned from a MAN who has never been my lover -- but is a very dear friend.  Much of his energy work centered around various practices of sexual magic, tantric sex and all kinds of related things.  I knew him both in his frustrated celibacy and his interesting and active sexual life.
<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, I have been fortunate to have powerful intelligent men as both lovers and friends.  Stranger still, men TALK with me about their experience.  It helps that I'm a psychic and an empath.
<br>
<br>
No, it's not the same thing as being there.  Nope, I'm not a man.
<br>
<br>
I know men (as well as women) who repress their sexuality with great intensity because they are pursuing spiritual and energetic enlightenment.  Sometimes this is helpful and sometimes it isn't.  Sex (including masturbation) is an energy and attention release and distraction.  Sometimes that space of abstinance is helpful, and sometimes it is indescribably destructive.
<br>
<br>
"so when a woman says that she can prefer not to masterbate in order to have a vacuum that will help draw her toward a relationship, many men would find this incomprehensible.  After two days most men would begin to start humping the pews in Church.  Sexual tension is not a polite thing to walk around with in one's pocket.  It also tosses off the judgment.  One begins pay attention to women one ordinarily would find invisible, or possibly would even avoid."
<br>
<br>
Some women are like that too, you know.  It's just not talked about as freely.
<br>
<br>
I don't think masturbation is a bad thing.  It's part of the full spectrum of legitmate sexual practice and experience.
<br>
<br>
Your analogy to eating is perfect.  For some people, fasting is a part of their practice and spiritual growth.  For others, eating vegan is a must.  Some intentionally engage with the culture -- drive through fast food
<br>
and all -- as part of their practice and energetics.  Each choice has implications and consequences.  For a diabetic, fasting is a serious problem.  Presuming that one choice is the only workable option leaves all kinds of possibilities unexplored.
<br>
<br>
I haven't kept up on my reading in the forum, so this may have already been discussed, but there are all kinds of interesting astral implications to masturbation.   If you are mentally focused on a specific individual as part of the experience, for some people that forms a connection and the "solo sex" actually becomes a shared energetic experience.   This is not limited to psychics -- it's remarkably common.
<br>
<br>
I liked the "get a cat" post as well.  Most men and women are unable to bond without the sexaul dynamics getting in the way.  Hence they wry: "A gay man is a girl's best friend"  There are things outside of sex that deeply connected men and women provide for each other.  That's not something appropriate for everyone either.
<br>
<br>
I was mostly surprised that this interesting line of discussion took off in a particular direction and other issues weren't being addressed.

This shows an imbalance, which is considered normal. In a way I guess it is, but being the "evolved" beings we are I find it odd how many people except the given concept of sex without questioning it. If one can take that sexual energy and evolve it into higher energies they can be used for other things besides humping pews. While expelling the energies can have a temporary relief, changing how you deal with this energy will give you long term benefits.

</blockquote>
<br>
That would depend on whose ancient wisdom you are referring to. Ancient Taoists thought quite differently, in fact the oppose. Taoists found that you could cultivate your sexual energy, transform it and use it for healthier more productive living. They saw that sexuality and spirituality are entwined. Their view is to cultivate and keep your energy within instead of expelling it.

Oh my dear, dear sir, you should not over look a woman with experience. Women are not like material possessions. Cars may not get better the more they are used, furniture may break down over time, but people get better with experience. Sports teams don't want someone that has never played the sport before, but someone with experience because through experience they get better.

<br>
Spot on,
<br>
<br>
I am assuming something now, maybe women and men find confidence attractive not just sexually but as an idea trait, now if this was so maybe we are subconsciously attracted to the confidence that the person is presenting and the confidence that they radiate via thought energy. Now if this where so, what happens when we look at someone with lust? For example I see a beautiful lady across the street when I look at her I create a form of lust around her which would thus attract other lustful 'looks'. And this would work visa versa.

i've been through similar problems, mostly my whole life! This thread is very interesting. My own problems stemmed from learned lessons in adolesence through adulthood. Horrible acne, shyness, balding, stuttering, these things have a tendancy to kill sexual/romatic relationships! Now that i'm all grown up they have all dissappeared, BUT, aha, and here's the trick, those learned lessons of "I AM INADEQUATE" are still learned, and not fully unlearned yet. That, and i'm also in a relationship that cultivates comfort, not sex. So i am unbalanced as well in many ways, but i like that fact that i can see the unbalance and work toward resolving it.

 This shows an imbalance, which is considered normal. In a way I guess it is, but being the "evolved" beings we are I find it odd how many people except the given concept of sex without questioning it. If one can take that sexual energy and evolve it into higher energies they can be used for other things besides humping pews. While expelling the energies can have a temporary relief, changing how you deal with this energy will give you long term benefits.

I still have many, many questions about masturbation. The gamut of material on the subject ranges from Health to Metaphysics. How much masturbation is TOO much? When is it appropriate? It is the best way to understand your sexual organs, so in a sense i would think it is mandatory, not shameful. But overindulgence is a sin, moderation in all things and all that. Too much sex would be an imbalance as well. As was previously posted, does the MultiOrgasmic Male teach us how to cultivate that energy, to recirculate the semen? In Hermetics, Blood and Semen is the Akashic principle, the 5th element so to speak that comprises the tetrapolar human. It is the stuff of life itself, woven in the four elements of the body. I do believe that sexuality and spirituality are intimately combined, but the nuances still aren't clear to me.
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, that is another reason why i've refrained from sex the past years. There is so much power and mystery that i want to understand it more before "diving in". Plus, i don't want kids, an accidental pregnancy would force me to take responsibility for a life change that i don't want in this life! It would detract too much from my own spiritual focus to have little rugrats around. Cats and dogs are fine as family, thank you very much.

<i>
 The Multi-Orgasmic Man
</i>
teaches that ejaculation and orgasm are two different things. Through ejaculation energy can be lost. The goal is to orgasm without ejaculating, retaining and cultivating your sexual energy, transforming it into more "refined" energy. Without the loss of energy you have more to use on other things.
<br>
<br>
Through experience I will say that you can keep the energy even if you do ejaculate, though this is if you don't ejaculate a lot and still practice cultivating energy. Ejaculating every now and then can be good depending on a man's age.
<br>
<br>
One of the main points of this practice is not just about retaining energy but also spiritual and emotional health. If you have a negative view about sex or masturbation (or even yourself or your partner) then this practice might be harmful. Sex, and especially this practice, intensifies your emotions. If you are cultivating shame, anger, lust, ect with this then these things will grow in your life. The book tells you that you need to strive to cultivate love and be loving in this practice so you will cultivate love.
<br>
<br>
As for procreation, if you retain your sperm then your chances of creating offspring is greatly reduced. BUT (big but so pay attention) some sperm can be be released prior to ejaculation so other forms of birth control need to be taken. The good news is that by not ejaculating you great increase the effectiveness of the birth control.

Undines are Water spirits, sylphs are Air spirits. The Bardon books are rather complex, and i don't claim to understand it all yet, it is truly a life-long path and goal of practice, experience and maturation. But there are rituals where the spirits can be cased in flesh, with their willing participation, not trapping them, and they can satifsy carnal desires (or just companionship).  I would say that it is a very advanced tactic not to be taken lightly, for it crosses many spiritual and karmic bounds.  I would imagine Gandalf indulged in a sylph or two over his lifetime!

Nope.

I take a very straight forward approach to sex. In this day and age, you have to, IMHO. There are too many pitfalls (ie STD's and unwanted pregnancy) that I could fall into that would make things worse. It seems to me rather than struggle with eastern philosophy regarding sex, you should take the rule that as with most good things, moderation is key.

So, yes, these dirty old men, as one with their perverted cultures, sit at their books and write highflown justifications for their constant fixation on sexuality... meanwhile saving up money to buy some poor farmer's 13 year old daughter to be his sexual plaything.   It is a moral outrage!  But we, as westerners,  need not fall for their lewd sophistications.  Besides, name off any recent Chinese or South Asian Saints.  There have not been any.  In chosing Spiritual Techniques and Regimins maybe it would be good to be result oriented, instead of simply going to the disciplines that allow us to continue to do what we have been wanting to do anyway -- chase girls and play with ourselves.

What sexuality does is it intensifies the souls identification with the body.  With the Soul, there is the tension between being Pure Spirit and being a mere animal.  Sexuality pulls us to the animal side of the equation.

We are clearly talking about two different things. You are talking about a culture while I am talking about a part of a philosophy. I do not know where you live, but where I live religion and culture are two different things. You can have people claiming a religion but their actions can say differently than what the religion/philosophy teaches. I do not know about the Far East or this you keep talking about. What I do know is what I have experienced, which has taken me from a purely physical idea of sex to experiencing sex on a energetic and spiritual level. I will agree with you that if you view sex as purely physical, lusty, and "animalistic" then it will ground you to such ideas. Personally I fail to understand your distaste for the human body and seeing it as bad. If it is such a bad thing then why are we here?

I am not claiming that my stated ideas and your ideas on celibacy are in opposition, that one is right and one is wrong. Clearly people have to have sex or we would die off. One path may be good for some while the other is good for others. I am not going to judge what is best for others. But we all need to be honest with ourselves and learn which path is best for us so that we can learn, grow and be happy, which path can be as individual as each of us.

Even when the ideas of asceticism and celibacy were at their cultural height, there was no danger of everybody all at once becoming celibate and the human race dying out.  Sex is its own strongest argument.  It doesn't need you to advocate for it.  There will always be enough pregnant teenage girls to replenish humanity.

But sexuality is what holds us to animal consciousness.  The first thing my first angel told me was "Only those at the bottom cannot go to the Top".  Fixation on sex is fixation on the animal and physical.

I fail to understand what it is exactly that you are talking about. For humanity as a whole to transcend and live a spiritual life we must give up sex? And in so doing would we end humanity on Earth? While I can agree that with the way humans are now the Earth may well be better off without us, but that hardly seems logical.
<br>
<br>
You do not understand what I am talking. I am not talking about sitting around thinking about erotic sex all day. I am talking about finding balance in all my activities as a human, bringing my spirituality into all parts of my life. Is spirituality something that is only done for an hour or two one or two days a week? Or is it something you live? And in so living it, do you not bring it into all aspects of your life? Can you not be spiritual while driving your car, eating lunch, or playing baseball? And why can you not be spiritual while engaging in sex? If thinking about sex physically binds you to the physical, then why not while engaging in sex think about the spiritual and energetic and thus bind sex to such levels? Even with this practice one does not have to engage in sex to benefit from it. All one has to do is draw up and transform the sexual energy when it starts to build, from thoughts or whatever, into more refined energy to be used for other purposes besides procreation.

I have to agree with fallnangel77 on this one. But this also points to an earlier post where i stated my confusion as to the ultimate sex/spirituality connection. Preoccupation with Sex is definitely not good. It ties one to the physical life with exclusion to the spiritual. In fact, it's a darn good way to not think about spirituality. But how much is too much? And if two people are intimately aware of their sexual power in an esoteric way, could it not somehow behoove their own spiritual growth? The first Tarot card has a symbolic image at the top of copulation, meaning the original copulation and genesis of all Existense. Heck, i think Jesus was the most spiritually advanced Human to ever grace the planet, and i think he probably had sex. But certainly in moderation, and in a loving environment.
<br>
<br>
And is anything that binds one to the physical life "bad"? What about enjoying good food? Succulent, rich, moist, dripping food? We all love it, and we all need it. Three meals per day. And lets assume its very healthy food, not cheeseburgers. At what point does our physical life and spiritual life schism from each other, and become a detrimental effect on the other. I know it's there somewhere, as the flesh is a training (battle) ground for the spiritual that makes our soul stronger.

<br>
<br>
I find this very interesting, for via suppressing my sexual power I have put it into other practices. However my practices have come to a limit and it is time for me to tone down on the reading and thinking and get a job and infiltrate society by adding a few of my thoughts now and again to my fellow workers. With this realisation I have come to a change where my suppression is no longer strickly necessary. First off a few weeks ago my sexual suppression unconsciously freed itself, and is now under control so when you say sexual power in an esoteric way what is it you mean by this?
<br>
<br>
Now I don't mean to blow my own trumpet now, but with this new confidence I can seriously walk up to any person and engage them with conversation about the universe in such a way as to provide and interesting lead conversation that doesn't need to evolve physics or metaphysics. I have done this and I have attracted within the last week unintentionally many ladies to me via this stimulating conversation that is almost perfected via study and is within me as a thought form of which I can grab any information I have obtained. In the past I used this information to enter debate in pubs and such alike but within the past few weeks I have found out how useful it is as to give an insight into my way of thinking and my personality.
<br>
<br>
However I have been thinking whether this is a misuse of the information that I have been handed. For although it is spiritual information, it is still apart of me and defines me as whom I am. I know that this information gives me an advantage, all I need do is open my mouth to speak it and if the receiver is earnest in their listening (like many ladies are) we both learn from each other.
<br>
<br>
However when I speak I speak to all as souls as if we all are masters, this way I try and listen earnestly to all and not just to what they say but how the decoded thought is relevant to the decoding of my environment. At present I view it as is not my fault if the information I send out attracts people to me.
<br>
<br>
Or is this an excuse?
<br>
<br>
This document as usual has provided me something to seriously think about and is not written just to transfer my thoughts to you all, but to examine my thoughts in the process. So what would we say people, is what I am describing esoteric sexual power and if it is, is it misuse of esoteric sexual power? Or should I keep the mouth shut when it comes to introductions, should I play along with the games of the ego? Or should I use the power of speech as it is supposed to be used?

 I can seriously walk up to any person and engage them with conversation about the universe in such a way as to provide and interesting lead conversation that doesn't need to evolve physics or metaphysics. I have done this and I have attracted within the last week unintentionally many ladies to me via this stimulating conversation that is almost perfected via study and is within me as a thought form of which I can grab any information I have obtained. In the past I used this information to enter debate in pubs and such alike but within the past few weeks I have found out how useful it is as to give an insight into my way of thinking and my personality.

This reminded me of the Initiate. By way of in-depth occult knowledge, he placed himself in elite social situations and dispensed spirtual knowledge for the sheer pleasure of enlightening his fellow humans. A side effect is that both men and women loved him, the latter often amorously (yet he would never accept their invitations as he was beyond the need for that. But he had also been happily married for a long time until his wife died)

 However when I speak I speak to all as souls as if we all are masters, this way I try and listen earnestly to all and not just to what they say but how the decoded thought is relevant to the decoding of my environment. At present I view it as is not my fault if the information I send out attracts people to me.

 Or is this an excuse?

All i can tell you is how the Initiate handled it, (in case you haven't read the book) but i can't adequately compare you to him because i don't know how you speak or what you preach. So to speak. Anyway, keep in mind, no matter how much you know or think you know, someone else always knows more. Keep the Ego in check. His knowledge was completely selfless. It was never used to further his own advantages or career or relationships. He condemned no one, rejected no one, criticized no one. His demeanor was of an infinitely patient, wise, and knowledgable man who could answer any spiritual question without hesitation or doubt. It is truly inspiring to read the book, almost like reading Jesus-level wisdom without symbolism, metaphors, allegories or antiquated speech.

<br>
Bottom line, if one had advanced spiritual knowledge he would know it, and probably wouldn't need much verification from others.
