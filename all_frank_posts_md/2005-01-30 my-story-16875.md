hi everyone my story starts when I was 10 months old, my parents tell me I was able to do special things when I was angry, i was able to channel my internal energy and flip over large barstools, and once they tell me I even flipped over a couch when I was furious about something or other, anyway this continued until I entered first grade and when in school I had no friends, absolutely none for a 7 years, my first friend was only one that would tolerate me and no more, but still a welcome person after 7 years of torment and hate directed towards me because I was different, after that 7 years the torment the other kids gave me caused me to become psychotic, schizophrenic, and a special class of bipolarity with three modes rather than 2. the torment became so much that when one kid tried to take my life I left that day and became homeschooled,
<br>
but still I was lonely and had no friends, that is how with the difficulty i am now a man at 16, I have to fend for myself. anyway in 8 grade I started taking martial arts and that gave an outlet for my pain after 4 years I found no more advancement could be had there, so I moved here to vegas and study psychic things and kung fu and internal arts. it's been a hard trip but in the end was well worth it, as now im in a place full of friends and a clear future with no bounds, im finally happy, a new emotion i have not experienced before, but I enjoy it very much. and my mental wounds have finally healed and I have full command of myself. so as you can see sometimes suffering can hold a better future than you can see at first.
