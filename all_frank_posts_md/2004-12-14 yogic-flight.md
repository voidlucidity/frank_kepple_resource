<section>
I just saw a BBC program on "The Secrets of Levitation," and they went to the Maharishi University of Management, where practioners engage in levitation through yoga. Well, they did it on video.
<br>
<br>
They were hopping around in the lotus position smiling ear to ear with their eyes closed. Gravity pulled them back sharply to the ground at which point they hopped again, looking a lot like alien frogs. They have a physicist there, who claims that these practitioners are altering the quantum gravitational field around them.
<br>
<br>
I didn't know what to think. I thought I should feel sad that they are diluting themselves, but they appeared to be very happy for themselves and convinced that they were teaching individuals to bend the known laws of universe.
<br>
<br>
I have a very expressionless feeling, like my emotions are caught up in pity, anger, sadness, concern, fright, and amusement, probably at the hint of homosexual erotica (they were all joyous highly sensitive white men).
<br>
<br>
It's hard keep one's mind open to "mind over matter" when
<i>
 there is so much garbage
</i>
that passes for it.

Watch 'You Got Served' like I just did. After watching what break-dancers can do, what these Yogis did will not seem very extraordinary. Just how high did they bounce? If they can float, and stay obviously up there, then I'll believe it.

So are you saying that you don't think levitation is possible? Or is that an incorrect assumption?
<br>
Also, how long have you yourself been practicing yoga?

<section>
Tyciol, there was no floating. They hopped about a foot. But that's actually saying something because they were flopping their legs while keeping them in lotus. It certainly does take some skill.
<br>
<br>
Nostic, that would be an incorrect assumption. I am highly open to possibilities of all sorts. I'm just frustrated by all the inaccurate claims out there... it makes it hard to find the real thing.
<br>
<br>
I don't think yoga is garbage, far from it. I meant that the
<i>
 physicist's claim
</i>
that they were using a psychic powered anti-gravity field was garbage. Not that I think psychic anti-gravity is impossible, but what was shown on tape was no different from what a biological springing of appendages looks like.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps quantum anti-gravity looks exactly the same and requires springing biological appendages?

this are methods the chinese used called method of light jumps where they used chi gung and doing techniques with heavy weights so that they were able to jump up as high as 12 feet from a standing position. as for levitation I believe it is done in a similar fashion.

<section>
If you are in the lotus posture and rocking forward and backward it is possible to build up enough momentum to jump up with the hands and knees. I'd suggest having some padding because the landing can hurt a bit.

<br>
Yes, in the video the floor was completely padded. It looked like they were frolicking like children on a very large bed.
<br>
<br>
Maybe I would've been more astounded by it if it was done by women instead of men!

<section>
Not levitation at all, I've seen this done. This guy saying they're altering quantum feels is a quack. They're bouncing. People can bounce just using their abdominal muscles if they want to.

<section>
All depends on the rates at which they were being accelerated due to gravity really dont it....
<br>
<br>
Ach, what am I saying, those "yogic fliers" are bloody hilarious!!
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
For people here outside of the UK, we actually have a political party called "natural law party" who promote "yogic flying" in their party political broadcasts!! How they expect that will make people take them seiously I dont know, or perhaps the point is that people then dont take them seriously? But they do promote some other coolness like the maharishi effect, which IMO is quite valid.
<br>
<br>
ANYWAY! Human levitation is definitely possible, I've know some totally trustworthy people who have seen it (no bouncing involved!), and experienced some kooky stuff myself.

<section>
In my experience, I have come to understand that gravity is a belief construct that we engage on a subjective level. As such, it should be perfectly possible to levitate, i.e. "defy" gravity. Don't ask me how, because I don't know (not yet, that is, maybe one day I'll find out). When I say levitate I don't mean jump in the air and fall back down again. I mean rise up and stay there. What Telos has reported I agree sounds totally stupid.

Levitation is the result of using other laws that are as natural as gravity. They are just, for the most part, unknown.

I know some of them.  And let me tell you, some of the people I know have nothing resembling the abdominal strength to do it.  There are sometimes cases of brief hoving with that technique, although it is very uncommon.
<br>
<br>
Atleast it is better than 50% of people who think they have TK abilities.  I have seen psiwheel videos, and they could easily be total BS.  I built a psiwheel, and just by modelling the physical motions the TKers made in videos I made the thing spin. I actually found that small motions move it better than big ones.  Like slightly moving my index finger for 30 seconds will turn it, but quickly moving my hand will just wobble it.

Hey telos even i saw yogis flying (some what jumping)  . They claim that indians could fly and they had the ability in ancient time.They also said that the Indians had built antigravity space crafts. Some what like flying saucer.I found on the net that chinese discovered ancient indian scripts which tell us about the working of an antigravity space craft.

You can't tell by the tone of the second link that it's a joke?  Lets be serious now.  A group of people show up to this competition where people build flying contraptions and crash them into water and start flying yoga style, and the only reaction they get from the people around is "That's some boring excrement"?  Do you really think that is what happened?  No, the people would either freak out, be amazed, call them tricksters and try and figure out "how they did it", or something of that sort.  They most definately wouldn't call it boring.
