Guys, please explain to me why you think the RTZ is to be avoided. To me, it's the most practical place to be while out-of-body. I've only managed to project there once ( still not sure if it was a dream, or real, though... ) but it seemed awesome. And i really like the idea of visiting friends and family that are far away.

<br>
Nevertheless ( nice word eh ) i keep reading comments that say you've got to stay there as short a time as possible, because it has no value ? Why not ?

I think the idea is to move away from your physical body as quickly as possible, perhaps that's what you've heard, as the sight of it can draw you back in. Â I don't think the RTZ is to be avoided at all.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where you got the idea from the RTZ should necessarily be avoided. I see no reason why it should be avoided particularly. But, then again, apart from the novelty value which quickly wears off, I cannot see the point of wanting to repeatedly focus within this region as there really isn't anything you can do. Well, I suppose you can walk through a few walls. But once you have walked through one wall, you've walked through them all as far as I am concerned. Falling through my bedroom floor into the kitchen had me chuckling, for about a minute. Problem is what else can you do?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Well, maybe there isn't anything to do in the RTZ but I sure would like to find out for myself. I've been trying for almost two years now to project and I would most definitely settle for a one minute excursion into the RTZ. I'm beginning to believe that the gift of projection is only meant for a select few. At this point, the RTZ looks real good to me.
