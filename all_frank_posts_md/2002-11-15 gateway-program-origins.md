Greetings all,
<br>
<br>
I have just obtained from the Internet the documentation for the Monroe Gateway program - and most interesting it is too!
<br>
<br>
But the page atteched after this message or so at the end is very important in explaining how Robert Monroe came to go from OBE to phasing.
<br>
<br>
I don't think there is much doubt, if indeed there ever was, that phasing is the future of Astral exploration, just as Monroe discovered for himself.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

 "In 1957 Robert Monroe began having out-of-body experiences that altered his life forever.  The first of his OBEs initiated a long series of explorations into the limitlessness of human consciousness.  The documentation of these first experiences became what is now known as the "classic OBE," in which a person actually sees her/her body and perceives his/her consciousness as clearly separate from the physical body.
 <br>
 <br>
 Although Bob's experiences were both dramatic and life changing, it soon became apparent that the OBE phenomenon was just the tip of the iceberg.  As he grew more comfortable in exploring altered states of consciousness, Bob realized that his experiences in what he referred to as Locale 1 (the physical world around us) had served to trigger his innate curiosity.  His keen sense of the rational and his curious nature would subsequently give birth to a more complete understanding of his OBE adventures.
 <br>
 <br>
 In time, Bob's explorations developed a level of maturity that required the coining of a new term to more accurately describe his experiences.  He had come to understand that "outer space" and "inner space" are one; therefore, the concept of going "out of body" no longer applied.  In practice, Bob had learned that he could project a portion of his consciousness "there" while retaining a portion of consciousness within the physical body.  His discovery meant that consciousness transcended the physical boundaries of time and space.  Thus, the term "out of body" was simply too limiting.  "Phasing" is the term he introduced to encompass these new realizations.
 <br>
 <br>
 All of us know the meaning of phasing through personal experience.  We merely take the phenomenon for granted.  For example, as you continue to read you might become aware of the position of your physical body.  You may simultaneously be aware of your surroundings, including such variables as room temperature sounds and smells, even the intensity of available light.  Perhaps you are even thinking about what you will experience as you listen to Wave VII exercises – all while you are reading and integrating the words on this page.  Your ability to do so is simply your consciousness phasing in and out of multiple levels of awareness.
 <br>
 <br>
 Your consciousness can and does operate simultaneously in multiple levels of awareness.  It may be directed toward the past, the present, or the future.  It may be focused in this reality or others.  You alone are responsible for how you choose to focus your conscious awareness.  The concept of phasing one's consciousness can explain all paranormal or psychic phenomena from Lucid Dreaming or Remote Viewing to Near Death Experiences.  Your ability to phase is so inherent that it may have escaped your notice, yet the potential applications for this remarkable ability are far-reaching.
 <br>
 <br>
 The purpose of Wave VII is to assist you in applying this natural ability.  The beginning exercises take place in Focus 12, a state of expanded awareness in Locale 1.  These exercises are designed and scripted directly from Bob's original explorations in what he then called the out-of-body state.  In the process of working with these exercises, you will become familiar with the "second body."  The second body (also referred to as the energy body) is actually the field of energy that surrounds the physical body.
 <br>
 <br>
 With practice, you will learn how to expand your energy body, moving it progressively away from the location of your physical body.  You will remember how to manipulate and control your energy body through the projection (or phasing) of your consciousness.  After you become familiar with the vibrations of your second body, you will have the opportunity to explore the far reaches of physical reality in Locale 1.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Gateway Affirmation has long been an integral component of the Monroe Institute's residential programs.  In Wave VII, you will learn to ask for help and assistance from those whose wisdom and experience is equal to or greater than your own.
 <br>
 <br>
 Trust that your experiences are exactly as they should be for you at the time.  Your heart-felt appreciation is an appropriate means to acknowledge any assistance given you.  It is, therefore, recommended that you take time to express your gratitude following each exercise.
 <br>
 <br>
 The final exercises of Wave VII are designed to guide you beyond the boundaries of physical reality.  You will journey to Locale 2, which awaits beyond the bridge that connects physical time-space reality with other dimensions and other levels of awareness.  Focus 21 is the bridge to other states of expanded awareness.  At this point, you will be a true explorer, moving into realms of awareness we will not attempt to specify here.  Indeed, such realms are often indescribable.  Those who have traveled this path frequently return to physical reality with few, if any, words to recount their experiences.  As Bob would say, "Now that you have the tools, find out for yourself."
 <br>
 <br>
 Bob was also fond of saying "Only you can change you."  It is the significance and meaning that you give to your experiences that will help you achieve personal growth.  Trust yourself throughout these exercises and know that a greater part of you is always there to help and assist you.

I read somewhere, maybe on this board, that Phasing will only get you so far in Astral travel. Like, up to focus 27 or something (I forget the exact number), then after that point you can only continue if your in an OB state. Can anyone comment on this?

<br>
I would say myself that quite the opposite is true. I know that the TMI advanced  courses go to Focus 35 which is presumably the upper Astral.
<br>
<br>
From a theoretical standpoint, the limit is not phasing per se, but rather the density of ones own Astral body to a certain extent - i.e. the same Universal law of vibration prevails in Astral projection as would be the case after physical death. Upon passing, the person travels with their Astra-Mental body to the degree of density of the Akasha that directly corresponds to the vibration of their Astra-Mental body - i.e their degree of perfection.
<br>
<br>
Phasing appears to be highly controllable in contrast to traditional OBE where high level projections are extremely difficult to accomplish and maintain. I believe this is because phasing is a projection of consciousness which always maintains a link to the physical mind, whereas OBE is a copy of the mind and subject to the instabilities and memory problems it is known for, and as is frequently documented in OBE books.
<br>
<br>
It should also be possible to phase with the Mental body alone, and reach the Mental planes. We must be mindful of the fact that the Astral planes in total are at a very low level of the vibrational continuum, being only just above the physical plane - above that there are several Mental planes, the Celestial spheres and the highest of them all the Cosmic spheres. Higher intelligencies advise us that these higher spheres are beautiful and blissful and light beyond the imagination of people in physical incarnation, but at the same time provides the motivation for those in the lower spheres to re-incarnate time and again to progressively increase levels of perfection and level in the Akasha with the ultimate objective of returning to the Great Spirit, Primordial Light, "God" etc.. The lower spheres are motivated by the prospect of attaining the higher spheres, but the place to progress is in the physical until such a level is reached that re-incarnation is no longer necessary.

  Hi SiVA,
  <br>
  <br>
  I've been beyond F27 many times...into the area of consciousness  Monroe called The Gathering,  as well as beyond that, all through phasing or focusing my attention away from the physical and placing the intent to just be there. I think the hard part comes in  trusting ourselves and learning how our minds interpret what we get when we arrive There. Our minds (or what I've come to call our perceiver/interpreter) struggles in the beginning to understand what and where and how, when we're in new areas of consciousness...but we can  learn to open our perception, learn the language that seems to be prevelant in the afterlife.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much love,
  <br>
  <br>

  Adrian,
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks so much for posting this! I have only heard of Bob Monroe's change in perception regarding how he journeyed into the afterlife (never seen anything in print). I'd like to share this with some friends who struggle with the concept that going OOB is the only way to have a 'real' afterlife experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks again and much love,
  <br>
  <br>

I was searching for stuff about locale 3, and found this. I'm really liking Monroe's stuff. I'm really interested in phasing. I've listened to some of the gateway series. I'm going to start at it again and get myself in a routine.

I love reading Ginny's posts too. this is really cool.

anyone have very basic phasing tips and starters ?

My idea of phasing is developing an ability to just jump to the astral location that you are familiar with. Unfortunately I have not found such a locale, but I have noticed that when I obe I now tend to skip the vibes in the body, seperating, going through the wall or window and just find myself flying around outside somewhere. So maybe if this ability is developed one could just project their conciousness to wherever they want, however it looks to me that you have had to been there before.

<br>
Shedt, if you haven't already, take a look at our

forum where there are a number of tips and threads on phasing. The topics and posts by Adrian, Frank, and Ginny remain some of the most worthwhile, instructive and thought-provoking, imo.

I'll go ahead and make this thread a "sticky" for now.
