Merry Meet All
<br>
I just want to introduce myself to the members.  I just signed up today...about 5 minutes ago actually, and I look forward to reading topics and participating in discussion.  Though I don't  have a lot of knowledge on astral travel and very limited experience in the matter, I hope to learn a lot while here.

Hello Magnolia Blossom
<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you.
<br>
<br>
May I suggest that to get started, you have a read of our Astral FAQs and also the Welcome to Permanent Astral Topics section.
<br>
<br>
That should give you a broad overview of what it's all about.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have - we're a friendly bunch.
<br>
<br>
Sarah
