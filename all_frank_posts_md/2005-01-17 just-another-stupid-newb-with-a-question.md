Hi,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing your experience. It is not far distant from many other people's ones, so keep up the good work. One thing however - don't put yourself down so much - you are as good as and have as equal potential as anyone else!
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

Hello:

I think you are doing rather well considering you have only been going at it a month.

<br>
Yours,

Its easy to get frustrated I was very frustrated but for me It took my mind and my body to adapt every time you think about it every time to try and seem to fail you must remember that it is all good and doing anything even simply wanting to will prepare the way for you and If you seem to have a failed obe try to look at it as more experience developing your energys and mind and dont worrie

<br>
GoodLuck

I've been projecting on and off for about 14 years,and even
<i>
 I
</i>
feel like a newb.
<br>
<br>
and the fact is that I am: there is just
<i>
 so
</i>
much to an expanded sense of reality,and Â to really understand it all takes many,many years.Although due to the infinity which opens for us during OBE/AP it is actually impossible to understand it all.
<br>
<br>
Non-physical dimensions can be very confusing,due to our ingrained ideas of reality having a certain solidity and stability.Even our basic sense of how to move the physical body can get in the way when we realize that in an OBE or AP we
<i>
 have no
</i>
physical body.This leads us to say:
<br>
<br>
"damn,NOW what?"
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
.
<br>
<br>
the solution is to be patient,and open to whatever reality may throw at you.Don't get down on yourself,or let anone get you down!
<br>
<br>
I know it can be difficult,but try to embrace the idea that we are in essence multi-dimensional beings.
<br>
<br>
Go with the flow,and try your best to destroy the fears that may rise.
<br>
<br>
And the image of the grandmother could be seen as an archetype of the "wise old woman" helping you to expand your sense of reality.
