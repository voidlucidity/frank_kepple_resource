<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Hi all,
 <br>
 <br>
 I'm new here, so please bear with me.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have been practicing inducing OBE for more than a week already. I have been really close many times (or so it feels), I start seeing thru my eyelids or stop feeling my body... once I heard a rushing sound in my ears--it was like loud whoooooosh--like a strong wind or something similar--it felt like I'm going to be out at once; however, at the last moment I experienced sense of panic and that`s it--end of story. I don't know why I`m scared. I`m so eager and excited to do it, I really do not fear consciously, but it seems to be originating from deep within of me..this fear.
 <img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 How to deal with it? Anybody has any tips? I try to relax and repeat positive affirmations, but so far it does not work.
 <br>
 Anyway, I am making some progress, like relaxing more deeply. Before yesterday I actually felt my astral arms coming out of my body. Also when the fear hit I felt myself sinking slowly back in to my body. It felt like my astral body had lifter slightly--maybe a few inches abow where it normally resides.
 <br>
 <br>
 I would love to hear your OBE experience. Whatever it is. I need some encouragement..that it is real! I know it is, but this fear thing is so discouraging. I guess it is a natural barrier and maybe there are some little tricks on how to deal with it.. I also have noticed from your posts that many of you have had this problem. Does it go away with practice?
 <br>
 <br>
 Thank you

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Problem is the process of disengagement is more or less the same as what happens when you die, in a manner of speaking. So it rattles the outer ego quite a bit, as this element of your consciousness always likes to keep a tight rein on things.
<br>
<br>
The fear you feel is the outer ego's battle to stay in control, its fear of losing control, etc. The emotion is really only a communication but one that is difficult to ignore. Plus, people interpret it in all manner of different ways, 99.9% of which tend to put a big spoke in the works.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Your occupation is research technologist, what do you research? I ask because Robert Monroe, one of America's forefathers on OBE research worked at a broadcasting station, and I believe that the radio frequency radiation may have played a part in his frequent OBEs. Though he never mentioned that as a possible source.
<br>
<br>
And most people today carry a cell phone. Perhaps if you bought 3 cell phones and strapped them to your head and 3 way called yourself and enjoyed the radio frequency massage until the battery died it might cause an OBE, of course I wouldn't recommend it, I just said that to be a little funny.
<br>
But cell phones could be the trigger for OBEs. Perhaps you could do some R&amp;D.

Itzhak Bentov found that he could induce meditative states by applying magnetic fields to the side of a person's head. I just wish I could look up the details.

Frank, I guess you are right. Thanks for replying. Still, the question remains--how does one deal with fear?
<br>
<br>
Potential, I am in Biology field--currently involved in cancer research. Yes, there is a lot of different machines around, but i doubt it has anything to do with my OBEs.
<br>
<br>
Anybody can help me with the situation??

<section>
The biggest problem is that the brain tries to understand what you are experiencing in purely physical terms. It tends to react to them fairly quickly on its own terms. The more you meditate, the easier it is to step in before the brain can have its full fear reaction and you can allow what you are experiencing to move forward. When you are not meditating, the more time you spend thinking about energy and the energy body and who and what you really are, the faster this step will go by.

You just have to let go of any fear or doubt.

<br>
Tell yourself before you being that no matter what happens you wont stop, and you wont give in to any fear.

<section>
I think a lot of people has a very interesting knowledge to share about but fear does not let them manifest in their life.
<br>
<br>
Tom , probably the main problem is not that the brain tends to understand what's being experienced in physical terms, it's probably because of the unknown  environment (and its motion) , it simply doesn't look familiar at all and generates the problem.
<br>
<br>
In treatise on oobbe it is said that during the first projection attempts is better to get out the body during day than during night, because of what you may find outside.

I wonder, Supplemental Iron can be moved by an electromagnetic field, so if we used a pulsing electromagnet near the right angular gyrus, would the iron in the body collect in that area making a type of connection that would induce an OBE?
<br>
<br>
I am right now using the Hyper-Dimensional Resonator (pulsing electromagnet) right above my right ear, instead of at the navel. Earlier I did this and then went and laid down, I noticed an immediate sinking sensation with lots of hypnogogic visuals. I'll let you know how it turns out.

  Quote from: Potential
 </cite>
 There are two types of Faith.
 <br>
 1. a) one's religion, b) what one believes in
 <br>
 2. that which overcomes doubt.
 <br>
 <br>
 Since everybody understands Definition #1, I' ll discuss Definition #2.
 <br>
 You cannot understand faith, without first understanding doubt.
 <br>
 <br>
 How to experience doubt:
 <br>
 When in meditation after a period of time, you may hear a noise, like someone speaking to you and no one is there. Or you may see an image as crystal clear as you see your own computer screen. The moment you think What the @#$!? or What is this? or even the simple "Huh?", it disappears. That was doubt. And the longer you can hold the vision without questioning it is the strength of your faith increasing.
 <br>
 <br>
 Faith is not something you just say, "I believe"and then go walk on water. You have to train it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Faith as small as a mustard seed can move a mountain, but most people can't even move the mustard seed, so what faith do they have? Their faith is weak, or non-existent.

Almost forgot,  the most vulnerable stage is just about when you are up to get out from your physical body.  You will hear , and probably see at this point figures in the dark that will try to scare you;  just ignore them completely,   ..mmm try thinking some of this dark beings are like sensual and cute female waiting for you at the astral realm....

Of course, also you may call for someone in special at the astral real, this will hear you no matter where he is , and will come to you if is not busy in other tasks.

Try intaking some more energy too.

One time when trying to project I asked for help and I felt definite acceleration in my "movement" out, but then again my fear interfered. I also wish i could meet my grandpa who died 22 years ago. I still miss him very much.

Hi Ivanda
<br>
<br>
As far as I know fear and other limitations are natural barriers to oobe. So it is better to take the long and hard way rather than the faster. Your body and mind need to get used to oobe step by step, no matter if this takes several years.
<br>
<br>
I think it is not a very good idea to ask any entity to help you get out of your body, you must learn this by yourself.    mmm when want to get in touch with anyone who has passed away I just get in deep meditation and feel and sense for my beloved ones, also it helps to my spiritual development.  Well that's what I think about this.
<br>
<br>
See you around.

BirthOfTheNight, in the morning drink some coffee with sugar and creamer(very important), wait about 4-5 hours, go meditate and then lay down. You should get at least paralyzed and some vibrations, maybe an actual OBE. When I stopped the coffee, it all went away. Took me a year to figure it out. I mean if I drank coffee everyday for a week, then everyday for a week I would experience OBEs.
<br>
<br>
I think it has something to do with insulin spikes, lowering blood pressure from the sugar. which causes sleepiness. And the coffee, because of the caffeine keeps just the right amount of wakefulness required for the Trance state.
<br>
<br>
For dreams, the area of the brain associated with dreams is the same area associated with sexual arousal, namely the hypothalamus. If you take aphrodisiacs with  just a little melatonin right before you fall asleep, you will have some cool dreams, not necessarily sexual either.

Coffee is more like a drug. You'd probably have an unreal astral experience , I mean not being able to identify reality.

It's better to try a real time oobe.

It takes practice, but, I believe, if you persevere u can learn LOADS of stuff in a short time. Also how to project. I was not very lucky after that one breath taking experience, but there could be many reasons why. So keep trying and u will get there!!

Hey.  I've had problems getting past the whole mind awake body asleep part of AP.  I mean, I get to the stage were I can't feel my body and I can't seem to get the right idea of what to do next.  What do you do next?  Induce energy, imagine yourself floating, what?  I'm confused.

HI Andali27

Some people seem to Intake energy; I mean to have more energy under control.  Other people cheat their subconscious mind and enter into an astral dimension.    I'm still "discovering" my out of body realm.
