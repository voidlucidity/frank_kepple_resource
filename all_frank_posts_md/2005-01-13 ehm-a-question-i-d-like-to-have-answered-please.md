 One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small

 And the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all;

 Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall.

 And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall;
 <br>
 Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call;

 To call Alice, when she was just small.

 When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go;
 <br>
 And you've just had some kind of mushroom,

 Go ask Alice, I think she'll know.

 When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead;

 All the World's a Stage - The Tantra of Detachment
 <br>
 <br>
 Do we allow the Tantric play that is our life to unfold,
 <br>
 guided by our inner sense, our inner director,or are we stuck on our individual reaction to one of the other players on the stage of life?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 "All the worlds a stage ..
 <br>
 and all the men and women, merely players.
 <br>
 They have their exits and their entrances,
 <br>
 and each one in their time plays many parts."
 <br>
 So wrote William Shakespeare
 <br>
 400 odd years ago in "As you like it"The Play
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: orange;">
 ....As I sit in the audience, swept up in this detachment, I experience the emotions, the highs and the lows ...(but)...
 <br>
 How much of Life will I miss ..
 <br>
 We, each of us, is a living Tantra..
 <br>
 Who is our unconscious inner Director ..
 <br>
 and how many times do we even hear this director
 <br>
 let alone heed what we hear ..
 <br>
 Do we allow the play to unfold ..
 <br>
 or are we stuck on our individual reaction to one of the other players ..
 <br>
 or one of the props ......
 <br>
 To whom do we give the power of
 <br>
 God or Goddess .......thus abdicating our own directorship ..
 <br>
 defining our own expression of Tantra
 <br>
 by someone else's rules - and experiences ..?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: green;">
 As Laurence Fishburne asked in the movie "The Matrix,"Neo , will you take the blue pill or the red pill?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So today I will be a dargonesti swimming magically in the sea and tomorrow I will be Falkor saying "Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest. Things will work out fine Atreju. Never give up and luck will find you."

<br>
yes we play a role in life
<br>
more than one of course for example :
<br>
as son and student lover employee father et al
<br>
we set the roles before we came
<br>
some of them
<br>
others are set by other players
<br>
we have freewill
<br>
there is also predestiny
<br>
some guide posts
<br>
i am told
<br>
that we have set before we came
<br>
and the other choices
<br>
we make after getting here
<br>
so our path of free choices
<br>
meanders on our journey of life
<br>
stopping at the guideposts that are predestined
<br>
but deciding how to go on from that one to the next one
<br>
predestined stops include birthplace and marriages and death
<br>
but i am told there is a plan B
<br>
so are we playing a role
<br>
yes several mate determined by choice
<br>
and freewill
<br>
and fate
<br>
and predestiny
<br>
and D all of the above
<br>
how much choice we are afforded by the universe
<br>
is supposedly determined by how we lived the previous life
<br>
so that the next life of the soul is to learn more lessons
<br>
either better than before or new to us
<br>
the more love shown the more choice
<br>
<br>
the soul goes again incarnating
<br>
but the spirit only has one go
<br>
<br>
best i can do
<br>
did you want fries with that ??
<br>
lol
<br>
life is good
<br>
go live it
<br>
shine
<br>
<br>
there are both not either

No, though I'd say it'd help to have an open mind towards what you're attempting, if not a firm expectation of it to work. I've only had the dreams though, not the projections.

This is an excellent thread.
<br>
<br>
Xz, I was honestly trying to offer a meaningful response. But considering how vocal I've been about encouraging more demonstration of AP, you're right, I should be ashamed.
<br>
<br>
In the past few minutes I've been looking at this entire site through the lens of make-believe, or "role-playing" as it is more maturely known.
<br>
<br>
This place really
<i>
 does
</i>
look like everyone could just be making [edit] up.

But, don't worry. Assuredly, that's not the case. People come here to share their thoughts and experiences on this startling phenomenon.

Sometimes what we see with our eyes can seem like fantasy but we know in our hearts the truth . There is no harm if laughter is amongst us and not against another . Laugh with me anytime and laugh at me when i can take it on the chin . But don't laugh at me if you know i can't . So if I laughed and hurt i beg forgiveness . I would not try to harm .
<br>
<br>
I reread this thread too and see only love and lighthearted laughter and musings . But you are right too . It seems like it is made up if you look at it wrong . The ethereal the esoteric the surreal the supernatural are these the imaginings of mad people or are we sane and they are the blind ones . Which is the illusion ?

Let insipid figures of light pass by,

The mighty light of ten thousand suns,

Challenges infinity and is soon gone.

To others the fear of solitude.

Brave Helios wake up your steads,

Thanks for the answer guys...
<br>
redcatherine.... I have no clue whether you are trying to help or just trying to confuse me...
<br>
<br>
I'm not a university student... I'm a 15 year old high school dumbass, who would like to attemp Atral Projection...
<br>
<br>
But at some points in time there will be hardships... and in order to pass these hardships.. You need to be more social and ask alot more around places where people know things...
<br>
<br>
But if these people... Including moderators... Are mean to you and insult you so that it makes you basically want to give up and just try something else....
<br>
<br>
Then complain... and if you get positive responses (Telos)... Then you don't give up, knowing there are good people there to help you...
<br>
<br>
But if you encounter a person that gives you confusing words and difficult questions.. (redcatherine)... Then it just makes you unsure of yourself again....
<br>
<br>
Please just give me a straight answer catherine... Real or not... No more questions that would try to confuse me even more....
<br>
<br>
I would believe Astral Projection is real because there are alot of books on them and countless sites....
<br>
<br>
If you please... Stop trying to confuse me, if that's what you're trying to do...

She is not. She's telling you from her own rather wide and deep experiences the best way she knows how. Her posts are likely to be worth re-reading more than once. There are many individuals here who are like that, however you may have to consider reading the posts from different points of view before deciding what the author intended as language is very limited in this kind of arena.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I am locking this thread as there is no point in continuing to speak at cross purposes. Whether you intended to or not, you have posted a somewhat tongue-in-cheek question in the
<u>
 Chat
</u>
forum. As such, you have illicited what you could say is a like response.
<br>
<br>
It now appears, from what you say, you did not intend doing that. In which case could I request, please, that you rephrase your question and perhaps offer fuller information about yourself, so that anyone answering can take account of your level of intellectual capacity. Then would you please post to one of the more
<i>
 serious
</i>
forums such as: Spiritual Development.
<br>
<br>
There I am sure you will illicite a response that is more aligned to your original intent.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
