Just dropping in to say hiyas. I have been trolling daily for a couple months, and figured it was time to register

<br>
<br>
30 year old male. I have been working on relaxation and meditation for about 2 months. During my studies of meditation techniques, I became aware of OBE's and started studying() them.
<br>
<br>
I believe I used to have them often when I was younger. I can remember going from a lucid dream to floating in my room on purpose.
<br>
<br>
In the last month, I have had one AP, albeit a weak one. Due to situations in real life right now, I am just working on entering trance and maintaining it.
<br>
<br>
This is the most comprehensive site related to metaphysical advancement and I look forward to interacting with he community here.

Interesting what you say about when you were younger. Children can often take a while to adjust to the objectiveness of physical reality. Many people come on the forum talking about remembering times when they were younger that they would "obe" for fun not really knowing what it was. But now they lost the ability and would dearly love to have it back!
