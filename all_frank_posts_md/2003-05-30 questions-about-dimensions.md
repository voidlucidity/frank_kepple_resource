Hi,
<br>
I have little interogation about dimensions. They have 7 ones, like 7 chakras. Is the dimensions and the chakras are the same thing ? I'm really confuse about what they are. Please help me!
<br>
<br>
Another question, I have try to connect to #astralchat on webchat irc server. Channel seem to be private. How can I become a member ?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all!

It doesnt matter how many chakras you have. Its not related to dimensions. Earth is 4 dimensional (x,y,z,time). Astral and the higher "focus levels" (I've been up to focus 35) add something very weird. Its not completely correct to call them extra dimensions, but its the closest english word to the truth.

<section>
earth is 4 dimensional? huh?
<br>
<br>
the different dimensions shouldn't be thought of as things that are distinctly different from one another (ie "welcome to the 5th dimension! the border leaving the 4th is right here.."). nor should they be thought of as actual places as i once believed when i was much younger (thanks to 'teenage mutant ninja turtles').
<br>
<br>
the dimensions are all interwoven around us and in us but we can't sense them as we sense things in our own dimension, the 3rd. dimensions can be easily compared to light and sound. with light, there are only certain wavelengths that we can pick up on, visible light, and the rest, such as gamma and ultraviolet rays, are there, but invisible to the naked eye; beyond our normal senses. with sound, there are frequencies that are too low and too high for humans to hear. we can only hear sounds in between certain frequencies.
<br>
<br>
the thing that seperates the content of the different dimensions is their 'frequency'. our astral bodies, for example, are at a higher frequency than our normal bodies, and can pass through physical objects. we're required to use our 3rd eye to see astral beings. there are things in dimensions beyond this that are even harder to reach while alive (ie, heaven), and there are more basic things in lower dimensions that might very well be impossible to reach, but have obvious effects on our daily lives (possibly gravity, magnitism, etc., but these are the scientific community's thoughts, the community that has no proof of astral projection, so i'm not too sure about that one; they're probably just 'educated' guesses).
<br>
<br>
hope that sheds some light on your question. i had to type it up twice, because for some reason my backspace button sometimes takes me to the page i was last visiting.. does anybody know how to fix this? it's really annoying..

"earth is 4 dimensional? huh?"
<br>
<br>
Yes. In fact, distance^2 = -time2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 (300000000 meters = 1 second). This has been tested to extreme accuracy and is used for calibrating satellite clocks. So yes it is 4 dimensional.
<br>
<br>
"i had to type it up twice, because for some reason my backspace button sometimes takes me to the page i was last visiting.. does anybody know how to fix this? it's really annoying.."
<br>
<br>
Mine does that too. You can fix your backspace button with a hammer.

<section>
so we experience the 4th dimension in our daily lifes.. i did not know that.
<br>
<br>
heh.. i might wanna use that backspace button again sometime, ya know..

Earth cannot be fourth dimension.  Forth dimension is like the tent that the weaselys use in the fourth Harry Potter book.  For those of you who have not read Harry Potter the tent is much larger one the inside than surface area allows and that is what the 4th dimensions is infinite volume with limited surface area.  It's like pouring six gallons of water out of a one gallon bucket.  At least that is what one theory says.  Another says that the 4th dimension is time and if that is so then everthing exists in the fourth dimension.

<section>
those are scientific guesses. the scientific community makes lots of 'educated' guesses about lots of things. i've heard that the fourth dimension was the dimension of time, but this wouldn't make much sense. what scientists imply is that time doesn't apply in dimensions above the 4th. people who have astral projected to higher realms prove that time dies out slowly and it goes beyond what is at a slightly higher frequency. this goes along with the fact that you can't easily label the different dimensions, they all flow together. they're just different levels of consciousness that flow together infinitely.
<br>
<br>
as far as earth not existing in the fourth, i don't really know what dimension we experience physical life in, but the frequencies you were picking up would have to increase by a good amount for earth and the physical to vanish completely, ie you would have to astral project into the astral dimension (which in my opinion could be either the 4th or 5th or 6th, considering on where you draw the line between one dimension and the next). i always thought earth and the physical was the 3rd, but i'll go along with what anybody else says, it doesn't really matter.
<br>
<br>
like i said, just think of the dimensions as light or sound: there are just certain frequencies we can't sense normally, and these frequencies are other dimensions.

<section>
Time is the 4th dimension. The other 3 are x, y, and z. They are well defined here, but become distorted as you enter the astral and higher densities/focus levels.
<br>
<br>
You are correct that the formula I gave is not completely correct. The real formula is much more complex (the coefficients of 1 become formulas). What I gave is an approximation with no gravity. Believe me, you dont want to see the complicated, although it is very accurate.

<br>
<br>
There is confusion here due to the fact that science generally labels "time" as the 4th dimension. The next level back from the Physical has been termed "4th dimension" also. Personally, while I've used both, to make a distinction I prefer the term "density" in place of "dimension" to describe the non-physical realm. Which to me makes things somewhat clearer.

<section>
You're all getting slightly confused, there are two different terms for dimensions, theres the whole length, height, width, time business etc etc that we call dimensions but then there are the dimensions that have nothing to do with width etc but what we as human beings can sense, we can sense things to a limit but although we cant sense other things they are still there, there are dimensions or realms that are overlapped, in another realm an entity could have just walked through your living room wall, they cant sense its there but you can, they can sense things you cant - there are levels of existance overlapping our own that not even our technology can pick up.

<section>
It is usually helpful to remember Einstein's concept of a 4 dimensional space-time continuum. In his famoue E=MC2 (E equals M C squared) equation Einstein showed that under the right circumstances Mass Equals Energy. So perhaps the 4th dimension is Energy (and not Time).
<br>
SuperString Theory scientists have theorized that there are 10 or 11 or 12 dimensions. The numbers vary depending on the theory.  Six of those dimensions are tiny Micro dimensions and the other 4 or 5 or 6 are large Macro Dimensions.

<section>
C^2 is just a conversion factor because space and time use different units of length. The real formula (when the mass isnt moving) is E=M.
