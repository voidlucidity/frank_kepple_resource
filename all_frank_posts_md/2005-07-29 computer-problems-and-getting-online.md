Hi:
<br>
<br>
Sorry folks, have had computer problems and subsequent difficulties getting online the past couple of weeks, but the hardware issues will be sorted soon. I just borrowed a friend's computer to stick this notice up so I've got a limited time window. But regards to everyone and it will be Phasing as usual before not too long.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Frank
