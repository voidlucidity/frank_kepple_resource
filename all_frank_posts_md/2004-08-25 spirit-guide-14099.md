Does anyone know how to 'get in touch' with ones guide without being in the astral plane?  So far Ive only been able to reach F12...  Actually, Im now starting to get stuck in F10 and not be able to reach F12, but I figure with more practice it'll come easier.

Sure.
<br>
<br>
Relax, meditate, get nice and comfy.  Clear your mind.  Then ask your questions.  Be polite, they are sentient beings.
<br>
<br>
Now the answers can take several forms, from feelings to a lucid converstation (with practice of course).  Keep a dream journal and look for recurrent responces.  How they respond depends on your ability to get an answer.  And of course they know your master plan, even if you conciously don't (don't ask for lottery numbers [

Hello there:
<br>
<br>
There's a meditation technique called "Inner guide meditation" by Ed Steinbrecher.
<br>
Concentration and relaxation needs are not extremely high to attain results.
<br>
You'll find there how to contact your first guide. I contacted mine and outcomes have been very profitable.
<br>
<br>
Give it a chance as I did and you'll discover an entire new world.
<br>
<br>
Hope it helps.
<br>
Bye.

I've heard of that meditation andonitxo. Jason Newcomb mentions it favorably in his book
<u>
 21st Century Mage
</u>
as a simple method to contact the Holy Guardian Angel or what New Agers call the Higher Self. It sounds worth checking out.

Hi LilRaver,
<br>
You could also try the really easy method described in my Geocities Pages.  I use it for everyone I work with and the results are brilliant for most people.
<br>
<br>
Try not to be confused or hooked by the terminology used by different belief systems, such as The Holy Guardian Angel.  The primary Guide is YOU, your Higher-Self... the Great Being that You are.  It's really that simple.  So don't be manipulated into believing that the Guide is some wonderfully high being working on your behalf, because it is not... You are working on your behalf, only you do not yet remember it.  And spiritual growth is about Remembering who and what you are... Know Thyself !
<br>
<br>
Love Always. [

Hello: [:I]
<br>
<br>
Although I've been studying different branches of magick for several years I can say that I'm but a neophyte. Anyway, and pointing the origin of the holy guardian I've faced some theories till now.
<br>
<br>
As I know the higher self is the union between conscious and subconscius in that is called "superconscious", that is, to get to Tipharet in cabala's tree. So the higher self is in us, or it's just us.
<br>
<br>
But added to this it seems to be a large astral/mental/causal/budic brotherhood formed by high spirit beings and ascended humans with the goal of assisting other humans too. This fact is repeated in a good bunch of books on theosophy (Annie Besant, Alice Bailey, Leadbeater, and so on).
<br>
<br>
So uniting both theories it seems that in order to achieve that sounded superconscious state we're helped by our ad hoc assigned spiritual guides.
<br>
<br>
I use to talk with both them, I mean, my subconscious and my guide. The comunication level is different with them two. Whilst the first one is a well of knowledge about my self (body and mind) the second one is able to wake up intense feelings in my self.
<br>
<br>
As it's a personal decision to believe one thing or other I'd recommend you to prove before rejecting something.
<br>
<br>
Greetings and peace. [

Sorry, I've forgotten one thing.
<br>
<br>
There's an explicit recomendation in the book's cover by Israel Regardie, a guy which showed off Golden Dawn's innermost secrets on magick.
<br>
<br>
With this introduction I give it more value.
<br>
<br>
Bye.

Anyone trying to contact anyone non-physical, whether it be a guide or a dead relative, or whoever, without "going obe" in the usual sense should, if they haven't done so already, try the Bruce Moen approach at:
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///afterlife-knowledge.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 afterlife-knowledge.com
</a>
.
<br>
<br>
Bruce specialises in this kind of thing, i.e. chatting to people who live within non-physical realms
<u>
 without
</u>
"going obe". I've tried his method myself and it really does work.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
