I've been trying to assemble a daily ritual here, for improving psycological awareness and subtle body ability. I know that working on the energy storage and transfer centers is good, but what about the actual energy our body produces and the efficiency that it manipulates the energy our body produces and gets from the aether. It seems that not only using and opening them up consciously alters the down-state of the chakras but the type of mental and physical food we take in has a direct relation to the ability of those chakras to use the energy needed for proper mind operation and physical well-being. To make a point here I've been reading a lot about the Nazorean Essenes. Not to compromise anybody's religion or anything, but their way of life seems to magnify the circumstances that would allow for frequent, successful, and even prophetic obe's. Their striving to cling to deity allowed them vast knowledge of the earth and it's foods, which ones were helpful to the mind and which one were poison. They stressed a vegan diet of living earth foods. Regular meditation and prayer, and communions with the heavens and earth's angels. Also weekly fasting as well as fasting on certain days of the year specific to lunar and solar cycles. I'm going to conduct a little study into the dynamics of Nazorean lifestyle as related to the subtle bodies and their projection. Anybody welcome to join I would be pleased, as they are both vast subjects. I'm both new to the subtle bodies and Nazoreans. By the way Nazorean means something like "peopple of the truth." Another thing of what I'm trying to get at, as even though I'm not an astral master nor perfect in my lifestyle, I think that technique and experience aren't the only things keeping people from the unseen realms, but their way of living with the physical. I'm think i'm starting to talk off the head here and get off topic, but I just wanna bring up nazorean lifestyle as related to the subtle bodies health and ability.

Also if anybody has already seen studies into this matter of food related to prjection please inform me.

Hello: You say you think that technique and experience aren't the only things keeping people from the unseen realms, but their way of living with the physical. Yes, I can only agree with that one.
<br>
<br>
All my inner studies have pointed towards the truth of what you say, especially the Vegan diet, together with a person regaining a true sense of compassion and living with a strong sense of reality; as opposed to the numbed physical-life experience significant numbers of people in the western world are accustomed to.
<br>
<br>
Spiritual Development is a question of being aware and seeing the reality; and of having a life that focuses on issues that are meaningful in the wider scheme of things.
<br>
<br>
I find it interest also they don't just specify a Vegan diet, but a Vegan diet of living earth foods. In other words raw, fresh food. This exactly aligns with my experience. I have come across a number of people who call themselves Vegan yet their diet is composed of virtually all processed and/or cooked food. This to my mind does rather miss the point.
<br>
<br>
I'm not familiar with the Nazoreans as such. Truth is I'm not all that well read as regards mystical issues so I can't really talk about them. Except to say they must have been on the right track. Where they talk about communication with the heavens, that's probably their terminology for what a lot of people today would call "astral projection" and their term earth's-angels we would today say "guides".
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the meditation, prayer and fasting. Meditation is not my thing and prayer, well, that sounds a tad religious. Fasting can be a good thing for short periods I guess, but as to whether the day of the year actually makes a difference I wonder. Why not try it and see and do remember to let us know.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck
<br>
<br>
Yours,
