Hi Everybody,
<br>
<br>
I'm hear to learn how I can better control my projections.  I've been spontaneously projecting since I was a child, but never realized what it was until about 6 years ago when I was 21.  I got involved in Wicca (and I still am) and it kept coming up in the books I was reading.  I still have very little control over this, but I hope to learn and develop that ability here, as there are so many knowledgeable people here.  Every time I do project, I get so excited and want to do it again right away, but I'm limited to about 1-2 times a month.  So frustrating

Guess we're in the same boat. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to AP anywhere in 10 seconds?
