Hello
<br>
<br>
I'm always asking questions I know... I hope you all just bare with me.  How many of you have experience with meeting with guides of sorts?  anything interesting about them?  I'm interested in trying to contact or talk with mine.  How do most people go about that? In F2, F3, while obing, while astral projecting... or perhaps just normally someway.
<br>
<br>
Thanks
<br>
<br>
James

Aside from f2 or f3, there is always the art of channeling.  Many people achieve this by means of writing, talking, clairaudience, etc.  There are many books on this subject

Hi Froglet,
<br>
<br>
I work with guides almost every day. I've met several so far, each one coming to me for a different purpose.
<br>
<br>
How did I learn to communicate with them?
<br>
<br>
I've always been naturally clairaudient, so that helped. It was through regular meditation - shutting out the noise of the busy world around me and all the jumble of surface thoughts that goes along wioth your day to day life. An hour or so a day of seperating from it all. This, along with energy raising practices, opened me up to the higher vibrations of the spirit world, and I started to recieve feelings, thoughts and words from spirits, in that order.
<br>
<br>
I joined with some friends in a meditation / psychic development (also called "psycho") circle, with one lady in particular who's a highly skilled and experienced medium. When you feel that you are starting to communicate with spirits, it is an immense help to have someone there with you who can actually confirm who or what you are talking to.
<br>
<br>
As to books on the subject - look for books by either Ted Andrews or Doreen Virtue. They are excellent authors, especially Ted Andrews, who gives down to earth, practical &amp; easy to follow guidance.
<br>
<br>
Notice I've not mentioned about contacting them in the astral? There's no need. Guides will readily come to you in this world, and there's far less risk of creating the situation yourself.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

thanks for the replies... I've asked this because well, I'm looking for some one to help me along, a guide.  I think I'll look into those books.  any more opinions or experience would be nice to hear though.  I'm open to listen.

<section>
in my very limited experience with guides they tend to find me or I simply stumble upon them.  One night not too long ago I awoke outside of my bedroom in the RTZ and a man walked up to me.  He said something like "you should come with me" and started explaining something to me but I drifted off into a deep sleep I guess and it all vanished and I don't remember it.  I am assuming my subconscious got the hint.  I was OBE yesterday and running around like a madman attempting to get from F2 to F3 asking around "anyone? this is 2 right?  I need to get to 3!" and this guy came out of nowhere and I felt I had known him for a long time and he seemed very much alive unlike most of the people I meet in F2 and said to me "well I cant help you there" and smiled a weird smile like he was holding something back and I said "what about FZ?" and he said "that my friend I can do!"  He said to me "you have to just say a word with lots of passion behind it, doesn't matter what you say, as long as  with that word the intent is firmly placed to go to FZ."  He moonwalked a few steps and spun around and snapped his fingers at me and said "moulin rouge" and he was gone.  At this point I got rather excited to try that out but I got pulled back to F1.  Always getting stuff interrupted right when its getting good!!!!
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I find there are certain beings/subconscious forms on every level of reality that can aid you if you simply are looking to contact them and keep your eyes open for them.  I am not certain if these beings are actually independent of the mind or simply created by it, but either way they seem to have the answers!  Just be prepared to listen and listen well when the time comes.  If you want to contact a guide I would personally just place the intent before bed every night and perhaps they will hear you.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I tend to stay away from the whole notion of "guides" in a mystical sense. I used to use the word but dropped it a while ago as there is just too many mystical belief constructs attached.
<br>
<br>
The plain and simple fact is, if you lend yourself open to the concept of guidance then there are many "people" non-physical who will give you a helping hand. If you listen to the mystics it's like we are all "assigned" guides and we each have a guardian angel, blah, blah, blah.
<br>
<br>
Simply, if you hold yourself open to the concept you will guide you, it really is as simple as that. It'll take a little while perhaps for the idea to become comfortable but I'm sure you'll get the hang of it before not too long.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Sounds to me like you simply haven't met yours yet Frank, or you possibly have and just not recognised him/her for what they are.
<br>
<br>
I have. A few times. Er...mine that is, not yours.
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
So have a great number of my friends who have learned to communicate with spirits. Not in the astral though, down here on earth (so I'm sorry Froglet if this isn't giving you exactly the kind of experiences you were wanting to hear about).
<br>
<br>
It's not something we learned about from books or any religious teachings. We have each independently met many of our guiding spirits, and we have each met the one spirit who has been with us since incarnating into this world.
<br>
<br>
When we started coming together on a regular basis we learned of each others discoveries, and how many others around us have also had the same experience on their own, without the help of "misguiding mystics". It is actually a very commonly experienced event among anyone who learns to meet and work with spirits.
<br>
<br>
I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying here. You're correct that there are many willing helpers out there. Many will come to us at different times for different purposes. It's just like having different teachers at high school, then when you go to uni, you meet your lecturers.
<br>
I have a spirit that's been present with me a lot lately while I've been developing some new software. Her name's Maria - a Spanish lady - a philosopher who got on the wrong side of the inquisition a few hundred years ago. And I bet she never expected it!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
But there is one, at least, that will have been with you your entire life. Someone whom you probably met with before coming into this world. Like I said, I've met mine a few time, and yes he is an angelic being (distinguishable by the different energies to other spirits), and he has given me some good guidance...that is...when I've listened. Other times, often when speaking with other spirits, I can feel him around. It's a good, encouraging feeling.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

I've got a big fat guy all dressed in red standing beside me telling me he sure as hell won't be coming unless you give your chimney a really good clean!

<br>
<br>
Ok jokes aside,
<br>
<br>
No Frank, people these days are not moving rapidly moving away from these constructs. If you believe so then your views on esoteric studies truly are very narrow!
<br>
<br>
I often go into meditation visions, something I just realised  would probably best be described as phasing in Monroe's nomenclature. There I will often meet with spirit beings who will show me something important, or tell me something helpful to me or someone around me.
<br>
<br>
I just realised this Froglet - I , and others in my group often do go into the astral to communicate with guides. I was just getting confused by the terminologies
<br>
<br>
When I come back out of the vision, more often than not, that spirit is actually standing by me, and one or more of the fully clairvoyant members of the particular meditation group I'm with at the time will describe that being to me perfectly.
<br>
<br>
See, I know my experiences are legit because I have many other people around me who can confirm for me what I've seen, because they can see it too!
<br>
<br>
Need guiding spirits? No.
<br>
We have all the resources within us that we're ever going to need to get through this life.
<br>
Gratefully accept their kind offers for assistance when offered? Yes.
<br>
<br>
This is the big thing. We don't
<i>
 need
</i>
the help of the spirits around us, but their guidance can be very helpful, if not just encouraging. They can help us know we're on the right track.
<br>
<br>
Most importantly, for what I do, other spirits can
<i>
 help me help others
</i>
. They can, and often do, give me valuable information I need to help guide or heal someone else.
<br>
<br>
What you telling me in all of this Frank, is that you're either just not experiencing these things, or on a conscious or subconscious level, or you've already dismissed them, so your astral experiences are devoid of such interactions.
<br>
<br>
So if you're not experiencing interactions with spirit guides, why are you so sure that they're not legitimate or of absolutely no benefit, and that anyone who interacts with them is doing the wrong thing - working with "outmoded" beliefs? I don't want to be harsh, but this does come across as a rather narrow minded viewpoint.
<br>
<br>
I've never questioned your skills in astral exploration, but now it just seems to me you're a little too eager to dismissing things that don't support your own perceptions.
<br>
<br>
There are other ways of doing things Frank, other ways of seeing things. They're not wrong, they're just different.

<section>
Hello all,
<br>
<br>
thanks for the replies... like I said before I'm open to listening to anything about the topic.  I've never seen this sense of guides as mystical... I don't know very much about the mystical side.  Just what I read on this forums.  I became interested in this from reading Mr. Monroes books and he said that he had guides and in the later ones realises he was his own guide at a previous time.  I don't know whether I need one or not, I think I'd like to have someone fairly consistant to talk to from time to time, I think even if I'm talking to a later me, atleast I'll be friendly enough to have a conversation with myself.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
And saying this I can't say I've been able to meet anyone in the non-physical.  I simply have just begun trying to phase or obe or astral project which ever terminology you use... it only seems to me it's all different names for the same thing and each "way" is kinda the same in that you can go to the same "places" or focuses.  But maybe I'm completely wrong since I've only been around this for the past 6 months on a very regular basis.  I've read of what other people have thought about guides here and whether I need one or not they seem like good interation with non-physical beings and I would like to meet beings, that's probably a majority of the reason I'm interested in non-physical exploration to meet people in "places" like F3 and F4.  or which ever other terminology other people use for something like that.
<br>
<br>
James S, I'm not sure I understand how you talk to your guides.  I see what you said.  But I don't see how you can distinguish between your own mind and what would be another being.  I does seem though that you are talking or communicating to someone else.
<br>
<br>
Frank- I'm sure I read not to long ago that you said there were a few beings that you communicated with a few times... you said in F3 and you called them guides before.  If you don't think this now... Do you think that this topic is simply not relevent?
<br>
<br>
I can see that I have a few of my own belief constructs from being around for this time, (which I'd like to say that I would like to keep as objective of a view point as possible so that I can find out what is and not what I make it to be) but that would only be because I have not been able to build up my own knowledge from first hand yet but I'm working on trying to be able to.
<br>
<br>
Once again thanks for the replies and sorry if my reply is too long
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
.  I'm still open to hear anymore that people would like to say on this topic.
<br>
James

<section>
Frank, Your response seems to contradict what you've previously posted on these forums.
<br>
I distinctly remember your posting about having around 3 guides.
<br>
<br>
I would agree that people are not moving away from this concept either. They are in fact
<br>
moving towards it.  I honestly don't understand how you can cut this concept down when
<br>
there are so many people today that experience this--even yourself.
<br>
<br>
A bit off topic, but from what I read in your previous newsletter you seem to degrade things
<br>
like energy work(chakras) and meditation. Then you go and say you do those things. But they
<br>
are so common to you its no big deal. The fact is many people practice years to achieve what
<br>
you can apparently do naturally.  I am starting to wonder if all this no-mystical-belief talk
<br>
is a way for you to obtain public credability.

<section>
Hmm. Far be it for me to reply for Frank, which I'm not, but my understanding was Frank wasn't degrading energy work, but just felt it wasn't necessary (at least from c1). He has been able to do what he does without it.
<br>
<br>
Also, Frank may have mentioned guides, but I don't remember him talking about "Guardian Angels".
<br>
<br>
I don't KNOW whether there are guardian angels or not. But when I have read about them in the past, there seemed to be a lot of text written in a flowery garbage way that would put me off. If they exist, then people should just write the information factually, without all the flowery poetically descriptive words that irritate me. Just the facts ma'am.

<section>
I understanding what you are saying.  I am looking at it from a different perspective though.  It could be very possible that Frank's ability is very much a result of his seemingly free flowing and strongly energetic energy centres.  From what he was saying he "raises kundalini" all the time.  Most people do not experience this, even after lots trying.  Whether true or not, it just seems like an obvious connection.
<br>
<br>
Also I don't recall anyone mentioning gaurdian angels except Frank himself...

Spirit guides exist for me. Spirit guides don't exist for Frank. But then again, Frank has mentioned in other posts that he does not believe there is a God. My personal feeling is that without God, angels and spirit guides we are simply living in the dark. Sorry Frank.

<section>
They're not silly questions at all Runlola, but I wonder how important they are in the long run.
<br>
<br>
I think though a possibly more pertinent question is - do these beings have any idea of what F1, F3 &amp; F4 are?
<br>
<br>
Are we perhaps trying to apply yet another human construct to assist in our understanding of higher levels of existance, then hoping the beings from these levels will play by our rules?
<br>
<br>
I confess I still have a very poor grasp of these different focus levels that Monroe instigated.
<br>
What I do have an excellent grasp of is the fact that I have met and interacted with many spirit beings from whatever level they're form.
<br>
<br>
I've spoken to human spirits that have "crossed-over", and come back with a message or guidance for someone.
<br>
<br>
I recently had the absolutely heart wrenching experience of meeting a little girl who'd just died in a house fire, and was lost &amp; frightened. One of my group was able to call on higher assistance, and we all witnessed angelic beings come and take her into the afterlife.
<br>
<br>
I've met angels, I've met goddesses, and I've met earth spirits who exist in our plane. I recently also had the pleasure of meeting one being who identified herself as a seraphim - a very high order of angelic being who is supposed to be from a very high level of existance.
<br>
<br>
Why am I talking about all of these experiences of mine and experiences I've shared with others?
<br>
<br>
All I can say for absolutely sure is there are corporeal beings and there are non-corporeal beings. Those beings of a non corporeal nature seem to be free to interact with those of us who are corporeal. I don't think they really care about exactly what level of existance they should be in. Its certainly nothing they're bothered talking about. We're the ones that seem to get hung up on technicalities. They've got more important things to tell us about.
<br>
<br>
It has been pointed out in topics like this that mankind's previous attempts at applying such "regulations" have mostly been misguided. Are we perhaps not doing exactly the same thing again?
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

<section>
I like the questions that Runola is asking.  Frank, can you help us here??
<br>
<br>
In general to the posts in this thread:
<br>
Some people may not need these questions answered (James for instance) just as some people may not need to 'raise their kundalini' to achieve astral success (me for instance.)  While I am not interested in exploring kundalini, that does not mean that kundalini is not useful.
<br>
<br>
Systems are by nature constructs; one construct make work for some, but another may work for others.  Whether 'poetic' or 'rational'  -- 'mystical' or 'scientific' there is no reason to 'pit one against the other'.  All systemic constructs are necessary else they would cease to exist from a lack of use.
<br>
<br>
So, if the poetic or mystical offends you, then seek out something different (which is clearly what Frank is trying to offer.) 'Getting there' is the objective right?  But there is no need to 'bash' the poetic or mystical in order to justify the use of a non-poetic/mystical approach.
<br>
<br>
I think we can all agree that the 'astral' is for the most part 'a highly malleable area of reality' (whether it is 'collectively out there' or 'individually within each mind') so...why argue over things that are so nebulous??
<br>
<br>
If Frank's approach works for you as he presents it--go for it.
<br>
If, however, you want to use Frank's model but you also want to precede his method with a ritual 'fasting', a few 'candles' and 'a prayer', what difference does it make?   Frank will never know
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
and if his model truly works, the inclusion of your ritual will not impede your success!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Peace,
<br>
Beth

Hi there Froglet,
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I would like to move the thread back to your original questions about guides.
<br>
<br>
I work with my spirit guides and believe that everyone has at least one spirit guide of their own, often more will come in and out of your life as you need them too (however you should focus on just one main presence when you begin, develop the bridge of communication with them and you will likely find you develop a sensitivity or awareness of other guides as time goes on).
<br>
<br>
Our guides know when we are trying to make contact with them, and are often trying to make contact with us even before we get this idea into our heads!  They usually guide us through our life's challenges in subtle and often unrecognized ways (like through the "coincidences" in life).  But  we can seek out our guides and obtain more specific and conscious contact with them (which I believe is what you are wanting to do!).
<br>
<br>
I have found knowing my spirit guides has helped change my life.  Spirit guides encourage us to see ourselves as co-creators in life.  They can help bring us a structure that enables us to put the events of our own lives, and even things that are happening on the wider dimension of humanity, into a meaningful context.  They help us to know that we are important to the whole, just by being, and that we do not have to earn our right to existence.  They will teach you that there are no mistakes - only experiential learning opportunities and challenges.  Spirit guides are non-judgmental, comforting and supporting.  And with this kind of comfort and support we can be inspired to make those big changes we have always wanted to make, but have put off.
<br>
<br>
With all that in mind the way that I have learned to best contact and begin working with my guides is to use the tool of meditation.  There are various meditations available for such a task as contacting your guides, which I would be more than happy to share.  A big rule of thumb, like most things, is not to try too hard to make it all happen.  And regular meditation before even trying to contact your guides will help tremendously, as this clears the "clutter" and allows for the channels of communication to be open and able to flow more easily.
<br>
<br>
I hope that I have covered what you were after, and wish you much luck in your endeavors for the future.
