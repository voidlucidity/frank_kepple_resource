<br>
You are certainly not alone in having trouble with your initial projection. If you read AstralPulse (and other website forums) long enough you will notice that many people complain of similar problems.
<br>
Floating sensations during sleep and meditation Are peaceful. Each time those sensations occur stay relaxed. OBEs are as much the result of 'going with the flow' as they are the result of deliberate intention. (Few people can actually induce deliberate projections from meditation.)
<br>
Don't give up. Keep expecting and looking for floating sensations during sleep and/or meditation. Many times (most times) projection is a result of the number of attempts made. Keep wanting to project and keep trying to project and eventually you Will project. Good luck.[

Grey is right, these feelings are completely normal.  I have felt them myself, most do.  There are many theories as to why there is so much fear felt by projectors.  I don't necessarily believe in "forcing" the expereince to happen.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with wanting to have it and meditating, etc.  but if you force it to happen then you are likely going to face more fear.  On the other hand, if you desire and naturally try to utilize energy work, then it generally can happen without all of the negative feelings.

Thankyou for the kind reassurance. I have been reading all I can about astral for since I was 14 (10 years) I had one while I was very young and it was a frightning experience for me then. I often wake up with the sleep paralysis which has been occuring about a year and a half- actually just last night while GOING to sleep I had the same  which had never before occured. but then again I may not have known it do any of you prokect and remember what is happening does it seem real or more of a dreamy sensation? and agian thankyou for replying

<br>
Yes, I too agree. What you describe is ever so normal.
<br>
<br>
There is a portion of consciousness (I call it my protective sense of awareness) that is constantly scanning yourself and your surroundings, watching out for anything that could be considered harmful. At the heart of this area of consciousness is a reference library of every known (or potential) set of circumstances that you have ever (or ever might) come across which could possibly place your physical body in a situation where it could suffer harm - to whatever degree.
<br>
<br>
Naturally, the activity of this faculty varies from person to person. Which is why we get situations where one person would shy away from doing a thing where other would readily indulge. But we all have underlying circumstances in common, such as avoidance of excessive heat for example.
<br>
<br>
The basic goal of the protective sense of awareness is to keep the physical body alive and free of harm. It operates at root-consciousness level. Which means it is not something you can override with ease. Plus, it also has the ability to directly drive your emotions - which can put a *major* spoke in the works. However, with a degree of coaxing, it can be trained to take on board new circumstances. I call it putting whatever it is on the "ignore list".
<br>
<br>
On the ignore-list are all the scary or potentially scary Astral circumstances that either have, or could possibly come about. Anything my protective sense of awareness detects which is on this list, rather than instantly injecting a level of fear, it simply ignores it.
<br>
<br>
The ease with which someone's protective sense of awareness can be coaxed does depend on that person to a high degree.
<br>
<br>
One of the most common fears that initially comes about is to do with fear of dying. Precisely as you too have found. Now, someone who had previously suffered a high level of emotional trauma to do with death could well be locked in a state where it would be impossible to coax their protective sense of awareness into accepting the death-fears which typically come about in the initial phases of traditional obe practice.
<br>
<br>
Whereas, someone who had never suffered such trauma could perhaps coax their protective sense of awareness into adding these fears to the ignore-list after maybe only 4 or 5 attempts.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, you need to get your protective sense of awareness "on your side" so to speak. Otherwise, your obe experiences will continually be fraught with either you repeatedly being pulled back to Physical or your experiences will forever be plagued by all manner of "demons and dragons". As I say, the protective sense of awareness can directly drive the emotions which can put a *major* spoke in the works while within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Ahhhh . . . The Dweller on the Threshold.  The "Dweller" is that protective sense that keeps you from trying new things and taking chances.  Imagine having a paranoid bodyguard with a real low IQ.  Sure, he's beefy and can pound the crap out of any threat that comes your way . . . but can he tell friend from foe?
<br>
<br>
My Dweller isn't exactly beefy.  He looks more like that guy from the Hobbit, what was his name? Golum, that's it.  Anyway, I actually deal with my Dweller like he's a separate being, even though I know full well that he's a part of me.
<br>
<br>
I talk to him like I used to talk to my daughter when she was two years old. I say, "Dweller, thank you very much for protecting me from danger all my life."  But now I'm ready to take some chances. I want to take my awareness with me to the Astral.  I know you don't think it's safe.  But I'm ready to take the chance and want you to step aside when I go.  While I'm out, please stand by my physical body and make sure no one steals it.  Thank you for understanding. Here, have a cookie."
<br>
<br>
If you face the Dweller once you get out (hey, it happens sometimes), deal with him like he's a three-year-old, even if he looks like the Boogyman.  Tell him to step aside, for you have things to do.  Give him a glass of warm milk, pat him on the head and send him to bed.
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the boards, and happy travels!
