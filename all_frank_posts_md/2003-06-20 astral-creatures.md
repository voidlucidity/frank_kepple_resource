I had this astral travel lately where I was in a beatiful country. The lands were green with beatiful trees and a beautiful blue river flowing around. It seemed so perfect and then I saw a man maybe with green outfit and hat - one like that of Robin Hood. I went to him and told him Hello and he said Hello, he was laughing at me. He had strange things on his face which were like snakes or something. After being nice for a while he tried to catch my leg still laughing. I got scared and managed to flow away. I wonder did anyone have any experience like this. Who might this be??? What to do when you meet a creature??? Thanks in advance [

Vicky: As to what you should do when meeting "creatures" and so forth, you will no-doubt get various responses depending on the mind-set of the person in question: performing rituals, banishments, generating shields, and such like, are still common notions despite several several thousand years of human advancement.
<br>
<br>
Within the Astral realms live all manner of people who come across in all manner of ways. This is something people must simply accept. The best way of learning to deal with all the zillions of potential kinds of situations you can come across (IMO) is to familiarise yourself with the basic ground-rules which apply. One important rule you need to be familiar with is, within Astral realms, thoughts become things. So it is essential for you to keep a high degree of control over your thoughts *especially* your emotions.
<br>
<br>
Hence, the best way to be is to look at all things, i.e. people, places, events, etc., from the point of view of being a neutral, passive observer. Reason being, one of the biggest mistakes people make (and you read accounts of experiences where people get themselves into difficulties from doing this, time after time) is making snap-judgements about whatever it is they came across.
<br>
<br>
From a neutral, passive observer standpoint you can then make progress by maintaining an air of mild curiosity about whatever it is you wish to find out about. Though I realise only too well that is all a darned sight easier to say, than it is to actually do at the time. But, as with most things, practice makes perfect.
<br>
<br>
Also, there have been quite a number of posts where people come back to Physical, describe some circumstance, and ask if anyone here has an idea of what it was. Which is all very well, however, I found the best time to ask about something is
<i>
 at the time
</i>
. In your case, for example, you could have asked the person who they were.
<br>
<br>
While there are general phenomenon people commonly come across, a significant percentage of people's experiences will pertain to them in some way. This makes it difficult for someone else to give a specific answer.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello Frank!
<br>
Thank you very much for the answer. You are right by saying that there are many people who just ask for explanation about anything. I know you cannot really give an explanation about anything you have not been a witness to or when it is so briefly described. The reason I shared it was not mostly because I wanted an explanation but to find out about other people who have had encunters too and the way they dealt with them. It is really wise not to talk to these creatures and really be just a witness. I have met some other kinds of creatures before and I just looked at them but that was on my second OBE so I would never have asked them enything. I was quite inexperienced then. About the thoughts and emotions you talk about I really do not think too much while being out of my body cos I know I may see strange things and don't try to explain them until I go back in my body. The feeling I had when I saw the beautiful place was happiness and freedom and after talking to the man I felt worried. I don't think I ever created a creature by myself cos I don't really look forward to meeting them and I never think of them until I meet them. I am more interested in visitng the physic world right now. Well, I thank you for answer once again and wish you good luck. One last thing - on that OBE I found it really hard to go back in my body. Have you experienced this at any point? Or anyone else? Thanks again.Bye [

Vicky: Thank you for your kind response. As for coming back to Physical, the more aware people get the more aware they become of the return process. In the early stages, a person normally gets zapped back to Physical as a result of matters having got out of hand in some frightful way.
<br>
<br>
However, after a while people should begin to notice there is a kind of inbetween circumstance that can come about where it feels like you are back at C1, but you are not actually. All that is happening is the return process is slowing down so a person feels it more. It also happens the other way around where an ever increasing degree of familiarity, has the effect of slowing down the projection process.
<br>
<br>
At first, people tend to project spontaneously by "waking up" within a dream. With a degree of practice it is possible for a person to gain a higher degree of control by gradually observing themselves falling asleep. Eventually you realise that, as you fall asleep, you actually go through a number of definite inbetween states (chances are) you never knew existed.
<br>
<br>
Likewise with the return. As the process slows down, people can end up at around the Focus-21/22 state with the
<i>
 thought
</i>
of being within the Physical. And there lies the source of the confusion... as you are still within a realm where thoughts become things.
<br>
<br>
Because people "think" they are back within the Physical, these thoughts act as a kind of fuel which creates the
<i>
 impression
</i>
of being back within the Physical. But they aren't really. Hence the confusion or difficulties that can typically arise.
<br>
<br>
The solution is, rather than get confused or panic, simply remain neutral and get to recognise the "feel" of the particular mental state. Then place the intent to be back within the Physical. If that doesn't work, and you once again feel your situation change to circumstances where you are merely getting an impression of being back, then go back to the neutral state. At which point the impression should dissipate and then you can try again.
<br>
<br>
Placing an intent to be back to Physical can take whatever form you wish. You could try thinking about wiggling your toes, drumming your fingers, and such like. What you basically need to do is find a trigger that works reliably. With me, I find thinking about opening my physical eyes does the trick. Immediately I think about doing that, my physical eyes open and I'm instantly back at C1.
<br>
<br>
Another thing you might want to try is having multiple projections. Often I'll allow myself to come back to the Focus-21/22 state, drift around for a short while just mulling over my previous projection, and then project again.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello Frank
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Thank you again for the answer. You seem to be very experienced in having OBEs. I have only had them while sleeping and they have been only 13 since Dec 2002 when it all started. There was only one time when I was able to do it when I was still awake. Right now I am trying to practice it and hopefully to make it more often. Otherwise it is only once or twice a month. I was very happy last time cos I went to see my mom in England. I am in USA and will not be able to see any of my familiy for at least 5 years and she was on a vacation there. Being able to project is great. I also visited a friend of mine who's in Bulgaria... But I talk too much

Well, practicing is all I need. Do you know one last thing. I can watch through my closed eyelids after 3-4 minutes concentrating... Can you do this or know anyone who can... Well, bye for now

Hi Vicky,
<br>
<br>
I, too, can see through my eyelids when I have what they call a lucid dream. I have been told that I almost "Astral Project".  I just can't seem to experience OBE.  I do see through my eyelids, experience the vibrations, and also feel the presence of other possible projectors by my side, approaching me closer and closer.  I feel paralyzed and force myself to wake up.  This only happens when I sleep on my back.  I would like to try this again.

Seeying with closed eyes is what I belief is called clairvoyance.

Hello Shania &amp; Stealth Fist,
<br>
I don't know how everybody calls seeing through closed eyelids but know for sure it's not lucid dreaming - it's a way different thing. But I also didn't know it was called clairvoyance. Thanks for telling me how it is called. Now I can search for other people who also know how to do this or have any explanation. I in compare to Shania can only project when I lay on one of my sides. I have tried lying on my back but it doesn't work. Thanks for your answers and take care

Hi all.
<br>
Beings manifest in so many ways for so many reasons. Many choose the one form and merrily go about their business.  I have seen many morphing in and out of so many shapes and forms that I lost my fear of their scary ones and sat back in awe to watch their antics.  Some will choose to manifest in a form that is in some way significant to us, even if we aren't fully aware of the significance.
<br>
<br>
The 'she' you wrote about was being very honest with you, and also providing a lesson tailored specifically to your needs.  It was a question that seems as if it was meant to be reflected on, i.e.,what's in a name?? type of thing.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's only my thoughts on it.
<br>
<br>
Love always.[

Im slightly confused. Every astral creature/organism Ive encountered always could communicate without "speaking". Ussually it was a kind of physic communication type thing. Like a sudden rush of understanding.

do you think that perhaps when you see your spirit guide or guardian angel, it is also an invention of your mind?  or is it really a separate entity?

i experienced to beable to see "through my eyelids"
<br>
though it's not what's in my room it's often a floor that looks like my floor (even though im not at home at the time always when it happens)
<br>
or other places and things like little pictures in my head when im going to sleep. often frightening things that scares me awake again
<br>
like when you almost fall alseep and then have this falling sensation
<br>
and wake up again. i one time feelt like i had another set of eyes
<br>
cause i could  close them and open them and kind of felt it in some sort of way. my opinion is that it's my astraleyes but im not shore.
<br>
(?) i don't know much about clairvoyance or anything else exept what
<br>
i have experienced. i opten think im awake again and im not. I also experiencwe having problems with coming back it's like i can't get back again, it scares me cause the only obe's i had is spontane ones. anyway don't understand a word about what your talking about (yeah im THAT stupid) don't know what c1 is but i think it's cool that you can know that much. ive been trying to understand things and not gotten anywhere. just seem pointless, it feels like ive seen to much and know to much than i really should. it can bonk up real good if your not that stable.(and im NOT muhahaha im crazzzzzyyyyyy)

Let_s_clear_it_up_guys!
<br>
<br>
Clairvoyance is the ability to see through time, not through the eyelids. So clairevoyance is to see the future, to have precognition, to be a medium, so have premonitory dreams. Everyone in theory can be clairevoyant once in a while, it happens to have premonitory dreams. So pay attention to your dreams.
<br>
<br>
To see through the eyelids could be that you are now getting out of your body and start to see through you astral eyes, and therefore you will see your room the way it is, or very close to that.
<br>
<br>
To see things while you close your eyes and fall asleep or are trying to astral project, could be that you have reached the state between awake and asleep, called the hypnagonic state. It is a normal state before falling completely asleep and into the dream world. During the hypnogonic state it is very usual to see pictures, very short dream like things, to hear voices, music, sounds, etc... then you will sink into the real dream and sleep. The other way around exists too: when you wake up, first you were dreaming, then the dream dissapeared and then you are in the hypnagonic state where you see things and hear stuff that have nothing to do with the dream you just dreamt or with the reality around you, and then you wake up. This happens to me often that I finish a dream, and then suddenly as I slowly wake up I hear music, or a voice talking to me and see some weird pictures, etc... and then only I wake up. During the hypnagonic state you are lucid usually, but not always.
<br>
<br>
So all that is normal, and if you see beasts and monsters, don't be too afraid, just consider these like nightmare, not entities that have power, because they don't.
