<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I am curious about the Monroe "Gateway" products, and specifically their objective of, it seems, literally "focussing" awareness on different levels of the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I am wrong, but these CD's are not designed to induce OBE or Astral projection as such, but more of a concsiousness shift?
<br>
<br>
That being the case - how objective is the interaction with the Astral and the perceptions of everything and everyone there? Is it a visual or intuitive interaction?
<br>
<br>
One reason I ask is because it might overcome the problem of memory retention as in OBE interaction. If a copy of the memory (as it were) is not being projected and needs downloading, but rather the existing memory is subject to a conscious/awareness shift, then presumably memory retention can be quite complete?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for any insight into this - I have never really looked at it before. I am interested from the point of view of the Spiritual Truths site mostly.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
G,day Adrian
<br>
<br>
I have the gateway series on tape &amp; am in the process of replacing them with cd's at the moment &amp; have found them to be very beneficial in controling OBE's better, having them last longer, &amp; feel I have been able to visit higher levels/planes more frequently because of it.
<br>
<br>
Not sure if I can answer your questions here as objectively as I'd like though,because I have been having OBE's since a child &amp; don't necessarily need them (tapes/cd's) to acheive an OBE.
<br>
<br>
They definately help you relax &amp; fall into a trance state quicker than normal, thus potentially giving you some good foundations to be able to acheive an OBE.
<br>
<br>
I have a few friends who have the gateway series as well &amp; deeply wish to acheive an OBE, but have yet to experience one &amp; some have even taken it to the stage of going to TMI for the courses there, but still no result.
<br>
<br>
It is hard for me to tell you whether the process gives you visual results or intuitive, because most of mine are visual &amp; have always been that way, but others I've talked to rarely get anything visual &amp; sounds like the download problem RB talks about &amp; shadow memory recall.
<br>
<br>
Maybe you could post this topic again in Spiritual Truths &amp; see if anyone there has an idea, otherwise if you wish, I can give you the URL of a friend who sells all the Monroe stuff &amp; has a very wide knowledge of their products &amp; using them for OBE's. This would have to be via PEM as he is a very private person.
<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn't tell you more, but good luck anyway.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Adrian: as you probably know I've been researching this exact topic for about five months now. Therefore, I'm able to give you some reliable pointers. Though I haven't experienced any teaching from TMI directly. I'm basically speaking from my own research and/or direct experiences.
<br>
<br>
The whole phasing-in concept is built on the premise that wherever you point or place your focal point of awareness: that place becomes your reality. The place becomes as real to you as being in the physical. In fact, it feels exactly like you were in your physical body and the only difference is your surroundings have changed. It's what I call plain-vanilla projection.
<br>
<br>
As such, memory retention of the experience is basically the same as memory retention of any physical-world experience. Though one big spoke in the works, retention-wise, is to fall into ordinary sleep following an Astral experience.
<br>
<br>
As with anything, technology moves on. Astral exploration is no exception. Nowadays, it would seem, the idea of leaving your body in the way of early Monroe, et al, is very old hat. Plus, doing this causes lots of problems.
<br>
<br>
Main problems being: disorientation, which is magnified by subsequent reality fluctuations; confusion and fear, caused by the feeling of actually being separate from your physical body. Which naturally leads to fears of not being able to get back in, body possession while away, silver cord breaking, and so forth. All of which cause yet further reality fluctuations.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, phasing-in is a very much more user-friendly product, let's say.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, if you feel any of my posts could be useful in getting your site off the ground then I'd be happy to paste them over.

<section>
Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I am aware that you have been studying this area, and hoped you would respond - in particular because you have an exceptional perspective on both Astral projection and focussed meditation or awareness shall we call it.
<br>
<br>
Also of course, by projection of the mind, you are not, I don't think, restricted to the Astral levels as is the case in Astral projection due to the density of the Astral body.
<br>
<br>
Another possibility of course (unless you have already in Astral travelling) is to meet the Beings of the elements - the Undines, Salamanders, Sylphs and Gnomes - whcih of course are symbolic in appearance, but very real.
<br>
<br>
I do think this is
<b>
 very
</b>
significant. I wouldn't like to think of OBE's being "old hat", but after all, the whole experience must be as useful as possible, and that means memorable as well.
<br>
<br>
This is actually precisely the sort of thing I want to discuss in Spiritual Truths, because it is opening up a whole new dimension as it were, without the mysticism, and whereby many valuable lessons and experiences might be acquired.
<br>
<br>
I would like to think that it is possible to enjoy the benefit of these experiences without hemi-sync technology. In fact, I am sure that is possible, it is just a case of how.
<br>
<br>
I would be extremely interested for you to contrast the relative experiences of OBE and Monroe Gateway, and in particular - can you still meet your guide for example and enjoy the same expereinces and level of feedback and memory.
<br>
<br>
Withe best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
Greetings Frank
<br>
<br>
There is another issue actually.
<br>
<br>
Usually, in order for Astral life to perceive and interact with you, it is necessary to present yourself in a body of the same density - Astral density that is in this case. Mental projection is allows for far greater scope and reach than Astral projection, but it seems that Astral based humans in the Soul cannot always perceive a Mental body or Spirit.
<br>
<br>
I am not sure that the Monroe Gateway encompasses these concepts at all, but is more geared to the level of concsiousness involved.
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless - this is important resrearch for sure.
<br>
<br>
Could I just ask, in view of the price, is there a single Gateway CD that will allow full Astral level interaction (focus?)?
<br>
<br>
 Oh yes - and as Oliver enquired - what do these CD's sound like? Is is just alpha, beta and gamma frequencies with pink sound, or does one get to enjoy Dolphin sounds and the like?
 <br>
 <br>
 With best regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian.

<section>
<br>
<br>
Adrian: I'm not a big fan of the Monroe Institute, and I have said on another post that their way of doing things is all a bit touchy-feely for my tastes. But each to their own
<br>
<br>
What I do know is, for an obe beginner, one of the biggest stumbling blocks is knowing exactly what to do, at each step of the way. Point being, these people need to get into some kind of ritual that they can practice each day. Now it's one thing reading a book, but it's quite another having quality recorded guidance.
<br>
<br>
That's what Wave 1, CD1 gives you. It's a specific count from C1 (normal physical consciousness) through to Focus 10 (mind awake, body asleep).
<br>
<br>
It's done very professionally, and I'm a great fan of it because it has been the core help in my original efforts to slow down what was my usual projection process. (Which was basically the feeling of being shot from a cannon three times a week, on average, to someplace on the Astral somewhere.)
<br>
<br>
The CD does not "induce" an obe. That's the brilliant part about it. All it does is, "set the stage" and leaves it up to you to play your part. I'm not sure where the "Hemi-Sync technology" aspect comes into it either. There are subtle sounds on the tape but are mainly in the background. What you hear mainly is Bob Monroe's voice guiding you through the various steps.
<br>
<br>
 I only recommend Wave 1 CD1. It's all you really need. Because the rest, the average person could discover for themselves through interaction with others on this BBS.
 <br>
 <br>
 At Focus 10, you are right on the brink between human physical consciousness and the start of the Astral. This state has made it possible for me to contact guides with a *much* higher degree of reliability and, for the past couple of months, I have been practising "channelling" information while at the Focus 10 state, again with excellent results.
 <br>

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I have to say that Monroe does seem somewhat commercial, which is why I haven't used their products or listed their web sites. It looks like a typical sell-up type thing to me. A bit like those Linguaphone things

<br>
<br>
But of course it is the true value in the context of what we discuss here that I am interested in most, and thanks for your comments - most interesting!
<br>
<br>
If I understand you correctly, are you saying that Wave 1 CD1 gets you to that pivotal stage of consciousness where you can make your own choice? Or specifically, could you raise your awareness from there to the mid to high Astral of your own accord - i.e. without voice or hemi-sync guidance?
<br>
<br>
If so - it seems worth it.

I attended thew gateway experience lasst year...very enjoyable meeting like mided folks..well organised etc...when i got the Going Home tapes prior to the visit(ordered separately) I had a very short OBE while using them..nothing spectacular...when i went on the course there were approx. 20 people..two of  whom had experienced what i would term "clasical" OBE's..ie like sylvan muldoon, robert etc..one girl in aprticular said she was  wanting to STOP Obeing since it freaked her out..she said ..when we were lying in the cubicles listening to the tapes that she was going round us all trying to pull us out of our bodies..i was the only one who did not sense her doing this..she was quite an aggressive person..but i eventually asked her to describe exactly what she was doing/had experienced..in my opinion I told her that at best she was experiencing a "mental" projection..ie not an astral projection where you are actually aware of leaving your physical body etc..she eventually admitted this..so..there is the capacity to get into all these levels..they say..I was the Only onethere who did NOT get past focus 10..body asleep/mind awake....if i had I would have OBE's...I did not..and by the end of the week i got really fed up listening to the tapes...but that was my experience..i would encourage folks who are rely keen and have money to spare to go..sicne i greatly admire Robert Monroe..but i feel that the whole system now is to new Agey..and real OBE's are not really soughtafter..more the loving etc attitudes etc etc..nothingwrong with this but not for me..

<section>
There seems to be two different concepts expressed here. I'm going to call them OBE and CF (Consciousness Focusing).
<br>
<br>
I'd like to point out the possibility that, though these two "modes of travel" seem to be very different, they may be an expression of the same fundamental underlying mechanism.
<br>
<br>
What I mean simply is that OBE and CF might be the exact same thing. CF would be a more "high level" approach. CF could be seen as concentrating on the destination, where OBE focuses on the journey. In both cases, though, it's possible that an energy body is created, projected, and maintained by the original consciousness's "bioetheric" body.
<br>
<br>
I make this argument because Frank's experiences (from his posts) often have classic OBE elements. Also, when I personally work on CF, energetic sensations (because I'm sensative to them) begin of their own accord--very similar to classic projection attempts.
<br>
<br>
Energetic sensations tend to not be felt except for three cases: you're looking for them, you're sensative from energetic development, or they're simply very strong. In Monroe's first book he describes the incredible, rough, vibrations he felt at first. Later in the book he says how these became a hum, warmth, and finally just a feeling that he could get out.
<br>
<br>
So, I think it's possible that the same thing may be happening in each case, just a different point of view.
<br>
<br>
I say CF is more high level, because it's like walking or digestion. It's either learned or ingrained and the body takes care of itself. Classic OBE seems to be a more low level approach, learning each stride by itself and working with the underlying mechanisms directly.
<br>
<br>
One of the purposes of this post is so a rift is not created, people don't get confused or discouraged or think they need to buy a $100 dollar CD, etc. Perhaps the most useful elements of each approach can be combined. For example, it's been shown that energy work is not necessary for projection. However, many people (including myself) find that projection experiences are usually preceded by energy work, and dream recall is improved. Energy work seems to work like weightlifting. A more fit energy body, a more fit physical body = better performance.
<br>
<br>
Arguably, CF might be easier to teach - with audio, etc. Then again, some people might have much better luck with a tactile, low-level approach. It'd be easier for them to get the feel.
<br>
<br>
Please, let's use dotted lines for our theories, not solid lines. Let's see what works, and recognize our theories as working models that may or may not describe the same thing.
<br>
<br>
I think we're all working towards an enhanced, more consistent experience that can shared with, and taught to,  other people as easily as possible.
<br>
<br>
Let's keep all our options open.
<br>
<br>

Just a quick question: When you say Wave 1 CD 1, do you recomend just intro to focus 10(track 2) or the Orientation also?
<br>
Also, What do you think about the 3rd track (advanced focus 10 - on cd 2), do you think that the intro to focus 10 is more crucial?

The Wave1 CD1, teaches you how to bring your awareness to the Focus10 state. After a while, you learn to be able to do this by yourself, i.e. without the CD. What I do is, each morning, listen to Wave1 CD1 (track 2*) a couple of times just to get me in the mood. Then I go through the process without the CD. At Focus 10 you are right on the border of the Astral. All it takes from there is a little mental push and you are in.
<br>
<br>
* Track 1 gives you some prelims that you only need to go through once or twice.

A resounding yes.

<br>
At the moment I am practising putting out mental questions, over the Astral, from the Focus 10 state. Then I leave myself open to receive the answer. It's still hit and miss because I only recently began trying this. Again, it was my being able to reliably get myself to Focus 10 that opened up the possibility to try new things in a controlled way.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for this excellent information!!!
<br>
<br>
Are you able to meet and interact with your Astral guide (Harath?) from a Focus 10 state, and potentially carryout such tasks as soul retrieval such as you desribed before?
<br>
<br>
Or are the CD's more of a communication tool than OBE alternative?
<br>
<br>
Clearly, if the same or better level of interaction and sense of "being there" can be attained from a level of awareness/consciousness, rather from  than the more volatile/subjective OBE state,  this is
<b>
 very
</b>
important.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience!

You need to go through the prelims on Wave-1, CD1, track-1 a couple of times just to familiarise yourself with the terminology. After which all you need to listen to is track 2. I did try to progress beyond CD1 and tried the Focus 12 stuff but couldn't get on with it, as it was getting in the way of me projecting.
<br>
<br>
With a little practice, it becomes fairly easy to project from the Focus 10 state. You don't really need all the rest because, if you can get to Focus 10 and project, then the next step is to make contact with an Astral guide or two. They will be able to help you *far* more than some CD.

<br>
Are talking about getting to "Focus 10" and then converting that into a regular OBE and all of its inherent problems with reality fluctuations, memory recall etc., or rather continuing to raise the consciousness to the Astral (Focus 27 in Monroe speak) in a trance state as it were (for want of a better analogy), and participating from an altered state
<b>
 without the OBE
</b>
? I get the impression from reading the Monroe marketing stuff that this is the case.
<br>
<br>
If the latter, I am sure it would be a vast improvement over OBE, due to the increased objectivity, participation and most importantly full memory recall. That is why I was asking about working with your guide in OBE v "Focus 27".

Adrian: During normal everyday consciousness, our focal point of awareness is in the Physical (C1, in Monroe terms). The other Focus levels are thought about as merely an extension of consciousness-awareness that include non-physical realms.
<br>
<br>
In other words, when I project, I am not "out" of anything. All I am basically doing is becoming aware of other aspects of "me" that I hadn't previously focussed upon.
<br>
<br>
The big problem arises with people because they believe that they, on the Physical, are just a physical-body and that is that. But no, the physical-body aspect is merely one facet of the whole thing.
<br>
<br>
But please don't ask me what that "whole thing" is. I don't know. I only made contact with a small section, thus far.

 Just a thought:
 <br>
 <br>
 It's not a case of travelling anywhere in some other body. It's merely becoming aware of what is *already* within you.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
You are very correct of course in what you say in that we are a composite of physical, astral and mental bodies in broad terms - there are others as well, but lets just work with those for this purpose.
<br>
<br>
In an OBE, according to my understanding, the astral body (or a copy of it) containing the awareness actually
<b>
 leaves
</b>
the physical body, and which is maintained by the Astral matrix - the silver cord until they reunite.
<br>
<br>
In a meditative state however, where one is "raising" ones consciousness, no such projection takes place it would seem, but rather the base level of consciousnes is "focussed" at a higher level, and can interact at that level. In the latter case, as their is no physical separation if that is correct, then all of the problems associated with OBE do not occur - it is much more stable.
<br>
<br>
That is what I am trying to understand - the relative "quality" and "reliability"of the OBE on the one hand, against the focussed higher state of consciousness on the other hand.
<br>
<br>
How does that reconcile against your own experience? It is evident from your postings that the "focussed" Astral work is far superior to the OBE?
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

It's a notion that I too used to subscribe to. After all, that's what it said on the box, which told me what to expect when I opened it. How was I to know any different? But the idea of me getting taken by it now makes me chuckle, and it does sound rather quaint in a romantic sort of way. Reminds me of the feeling I get when watching one of those black &amp; white romance-movies of the 1940's and 50's.
<br>
<br>
I've spoken before of the role emotion plays in creating the Astral circumstances that surround you. Release of emotion, particularly any kind of fear or anger, has a full-on, right in your face, kind of effect. But there are other, equally powerful, energies that colour a person's Astral experience. The main two are:
<i>
 belief
</i>
and
<i>
 expectation
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Like emotion, they are powerful energies but their effects are very much more subtle.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
The Astral matrix or "silver cord" is real enough. It is what sustains life between the Astra-Mental and physical bodies while OBE as it where.
<br>
<br>
The Astra-Mental body also "leaves" at night while asleep, and permanently at physical death,  and the cord serves the same purpose. So I personally do not think that there is much doubt about the Astral matrix, or the fact in an OBE the Astra-Mental body actually does separate from the physical.
<br>
<br>
But this is the point I am getting at - is this so called "Focus 27" via "Focus 10" actually an OBE, or rather a raised level of conscious awareness to that Astral level? I suppose Clairvoyance is another example of Astral awareness without the OBE. The real question in this case is - if one is is interacting with the Astral on the basis of a raised level of consciousness, how does the experience differ between that and an OBE.
<br>
<br>
Also, and if you are not sure of which is occuring yet via Focus 10, notwithstanding the above, how does the level of interaction, qulaity of the experience and in particular memory recall differ?
<br>
<br>
Apologies again for pressing this one, but it seems to me that the Focus 10 CD is alot more than getting to the "body asleep, mind awake" state, which, after all, is a pre-requisite of most OBE's?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.

<br>
The projection experience feels like you have shifted your surroundings, not your body. That's the best I can explain it. As I say, belief and expectation are very powerful energies that can have ever so subtle effects. Whether you have a percept of different bodies, chords, etc. basically depends on what you believe is real for you.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks again - it is difficult I know to describe these things, and I appreciate your patience!
<br>
<br>
Just talking around this, - the etheric (in the case of an RTZ projection) and Astral bodies are really finer duplicates of the physical, initially at least, so it would not be surprising that they felt the same from an OBE perspective.
<br>
<br>
This must be the case I guess, because after physical death, which after all can be likened to a permanent OBE, the person often does not perceive any difference in the reality of their body until they achieve that realisation, and that is often a problem as to why Souls can become "earth bound".
<br>
<br>
My point of question however is that raising consciousness is not an OBE, but an altered state of awareness, or to use a Monroe analogy - focus.
<br>
<br>
I suppose the other issue is how real you would seem to the beings of the Astral world in an OBE and raised level of consciousness or "focus" respectively, if indeed there is any difference.

Does anyone reccommend  any of the single cd's that have hemi-sync on them, since they are $20 versus $100 for the gateway series? I see that there is one on transendence, it seems like a likely candidate for someone that has a little obe experience.

A business that has an excellent reputation, and operated by a person who has a reputation for not only being very good at what he does, but extremely friendly and helpful as well is Brainwave Mind Voyages:

<br>
<br>
I think these CD's are around $15 each, and have an excellent reputation - here is a typical testimony from their feedback page:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "I have used brainwave CD's by a company called Brain Sync, the Monroe Institute's Hemi-Sync (which was very expensive - did not produce results - and is kindergarten compared to your CDs. I really like your Trance Induction Lucid Dream CD the best. I think the CD was well thought out and has everything one would need to have a lucid dream or an obe." -mike.t

Obviously I have no association with these people, but I would be very interested indeed to hear feedback from people here should they try any of these products.

It's common to think that way, in terms of other "bodies" I mean, and it gives a person something concrete they can relate to. Though in those terms, the Physical is really a denser duplicate of the Astral. Thinking of the Physical as a start point, or basis, is very common. But the Physical is really an end result.
<br>
<br>
I look at it like clothing. In the sense that if I'm attending an important function, like a business meeting for example, I'll wear a business suit. When I'm pottering in my garage-release-workshop tuning one of my cars, or motorcycles, I'll wear overalls. If I'm on holiday, relaxing poolside, I'll wear shorts and sunscreen. All different outer layers that suit the occassion and/or circumstances, but it's the same Me within.

In order to operate on the Physical you need a physical sheathe which, in term of today's technology, has a certain sell-by date. Again, it is common to view the Physical as an origin hence the term permanent OBE. I suppose the non-difference in their reality is similar to the non-difference felt when phasing, though belief and expectation do play a large part. As you believe, so it instantly becomes. Which only has the effect of reinforcing the original belief, and so it instantly becomes more... and more... and more........... ad infinitum (literally).

There are so many variables in this kind of interaction it is not possible to comment on what may, or may not be the case. What is "real" is very subjective to all manner of possible fluctuations.

Difficult to say because the term "meaningful" is so darned subjective. Though I'd say the focus approach is more in line with non-physical reality. In that you are experiencing what
<i>
 is
</i>
as opposed to experiencing what you believe and/or expect.
<br>
<br>
The way I see the focus approach is like an advancement in technology. Someone said that the traditional obe approach and the focusing approach are basically one and the same. Well, no and yes.
<br>
<br>
To me it's like comparing a high-end manufacturer's top-of-the-range motor car with a Ford model T. Yes, they are similar in that they are both powered by an internal combustion engine; have 4 wheels each rotating about a central axis held by suspension; both have seats; a steering wheel, etc., etc. On paper they appear very similar, but in actuality they are very, very different.
<br>
<br>
That primary difference is: technology.
<br>
<br>
So drive 500 miles in a top-class Mercedes and you get out feeling relaxed and comfortable. Try the same in a Ford model T and imagine, 500 miles of being jiggled about; exposed to the elements; maybe a breakdown (or two) along the way.

However, I'm planning on using it for a good 6 months on a regular basis. Practice makes perfect !

<br>
You are concentrating on the physical-body rather than simply letting it go (as Monroe keeps saying). I often get the idea that people are lying there and monitoring their physical body, checking whether or not their body feels more or less asleep than it was 10 minutes ago, say.
<br>
<br>
Everytime you "check" you focus your awareness on your physical body. But focussing your awareness on your physical body, scuppers the process.
<br>
<br>
The one downfall with the CD's is there isn't any kind of manual. It's not strictly necessary as track1, CD1 tells you all you basically need to get started. But a decent hints and tips manual would have been a nice addition, especially given the price.
<br>
<br>
Oh, you say you listened many times. How many is that, roughly? With me, I only really began getting the hang of it after I'd listened about 100 times.

Hi guys
<br>
<br>
If you get your CD through a reputable dealer you should get a little manual with each Wave. If you didn't I would be writing back to them &amp; asking for it. The booklet has an introduction to the hemi-sync process (nothing you couldn't find on TMI site ) a "what not to do section", each stage on each CD &amp; a FAQ in the back of the booklet.
<br>
<br>
If you get them through a reputable dealer, they will give you some additional info &amp; probably send you a catalog before you purchase anything. One of the things they ALL seem to mention is ; do each CD/tape slowly, soak it up, the binaural pulsing sounds, the brushing sounds, each technique, &amp; really focus. I think Frank mentioned in another thread that he took quite a bit of time out on each CD &amp; really got to KNOW what was going on at each step of the process. Not sure if Frank was told to do this as I was, or he just thought it was the most sensible thing to do, but it is
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///important.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 important.It
</a>
's like learning to type, just because you have discovered which keys to place your fingers on, doesn't mean you no longer need to look at them &amp; can do 100 words per minute, take baby steps, enjoy without expectations.
<br>
<br>
Transcendence IS a good CD/tape, but isn't designed to do the same thing as the gateway series. The only one that comes near it is the "going home" series. ALL of their CD/ tapes you will find has that hemi sync binaural beats in it to some extent. On another one I have called "On becoming a life long learner", it has a grinding machine like hemi-sync sound, as opposed to the gateway that has a whistleing tone kind of sound. But the main thing to keep in mind is, take it slowwww. You will know when you are at the stage of moving onto the next CD/tape when you can recite a description to someone of what is being said &amp; what you experienced during each one, whether it be speaking about it or writing about it.
<br>
<br>
Then you can experiment with it &amp; do things like Bruce's NEW while doing Monroes resonant tuning, simultaneously. And, if the rolling log technique doesn't work for you on RAM's CD, use RB's rope technique instead, or elevator. Also, setting out a journal like RB does &amp; recording "everything", any sensations, feelings, thoughts, visions, dreams, AP, OBE etc &amp; moon phase if you wish.
<br>
<br>
Good luck on your journeys

I actually went to TMI for their Gateway Voyage in January. I had Wave 1 for a few years, doing it on and off, but never really put a lot of effort into it until before I went to TMI. I didn't experience that much while I was there (I wasn't able to "get" to the Focus states), but almost every other person in my group was able to get there. I really like Frank's posts. A lot of what I was told while I was there is the same thing Frank is posting. Maybe I was "getting" to the Focus states, but they weren't what I was expecting so I shrugged it off. Also, Frank's last post about checking your physical body to see if you are "there" in F10 is so simple but true. That's what I was doing most of the week, and it stopped me from getting anywhere.
<br>
Now, on to the point of my post. I was able to "get" to F12 pretty easily, but that was in the beginning of the week. After the day of F12, I fell asleep in almost every other tape. I for to F15 once, and that was without a tape, but other than that I was sleeping during the week. What I did take away from it was my initial experiences in F12. I remember doing the counting and thinking it felt the same as F10 and even C1, but the trick was coming back from F12.
<br>
This is something I don't do when I meditate (or try to meditate), but I think it is very important. Don't just stop the meditation or TMI tape session and get up and go about your day. I noticed that I was "really" in F12 when I had to slowly come back to F10. I felt such a change in my perception that I would have missed if I would have just sat up and walked around. I also noticed a difference between F10 and C1 when we slowly counted from 10 to 1 during those first few tapes.
<br>
I am really bummed that I didn't "get" to F21, because I was really looking forward to it. I guess maybe I will appreciate it more if I ever do experience it down the road.
<br>
I also want to say that my experience doesn't mean that TMI programs are bogus. I was one of the only people (if not THE only person) to not get to the different focus states during the Voyage. Everybody is different and experiences the world in different ways, and this is makes it that much more difficult to have everybody experience the different INTERNAL states in the same way.

They actually don't have a way to measure if you are in the states. I think they played the tapes and people talked about what they felt and most of the descriptions had the same basic feel to them. The trainers at TMI were very much into not giving anybody preconceived notions about what to expect, so we usually got descriptions of what the states generally were afterwards.
<br>
Yes, it was mainly my falling asleep that I used as a guideline for not reaching the states. Towards the end I was very frustrated and made myself stay awake, but that also stopped me from relaxing.
<br>
I actually am going to start back from the beginning and listen to Wave 1 like Frank did - 2 times a day every day from a few months and move slowly through the tapes. I think most people don't have Frank's patience - I sure don't - and they want to skip to the "good" stuff without getting a good base. This is probably why people don't experience anything.
<br>
Frank has inspired me to dig up the old CD's and start fresh.

I have listened to the Orentation and Intro to Focus 10 cd probably 20 times allthough I have probably fallen asleep 12 out of 20 times tryin to make it through Focus 10 after listening to Orentation. If I listen to them seperately I do fine but if I listen to them concurently I wake up to white noise somewhere on the Focus 10 part of the cd. Maybe I should just focus on Focus 10.

Is the booklet a CD inlay booklet? Like the ones you get in a lot of music CD's that are part of the front cover? Negative. It is a separate 28 page booklet that has info on various things like *Cautions &amp; Warnings* E.g If you have a tendency toward seizures, auditory disorders or adverse mental conditions, DO NOT USE. Do not use Dolby or other noise reduction systems with it.
<br>
<br>
This one is my favourite : DO NOT use Hemi Sync while driving or operating heavy equipment.................................Ohhhhhhhhhh, that's not fair.
<br>
<br>
It also suggests you use headphones &amp; not ear buds, but I know lots of people that use them with no problem, I use headphones anyway. No tight clothing,shoes,glasses or contacts. Allow one hour after eating, alcohol,drugs &amp; caffeine. And like RB suggests in his book, do it lying down or in a comfortable chair.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I find it hard to fall into total sleep while using hemi sync, whereas, my girlfriend only has to wear them for 5 mins &amp; she is snoring. I also tried it on my sister who is into various metaphysical things &amp; didn't tell her about TMI &amp; hemi sync, I just gave her the headphones &amp; asked her to tell me what she was experiencing. After 5 mins she took it off &amp; said "I'd better stop, because I'm only here to visit for a few hours &amp; this thing is making me fall into a trance, if I keep going I wont be able to talk to you".
<br>
<br>
Ok, gotta go, but one final thing, Frank, I saw you on that show "Englands worst drivers", so maybe you should stop using Hemi-sync while driving tanks, hehe

Funny you mentioned the no driving thing. While I was at TMI one of the trainers was actually Bob Monroe's step-daughter, and she told me that the reason they initially put that warning on there was from one of the early days of testing. Somehow a cousin or maybe a family friend was given to tape to try and decided to listen to the tape while driving and ended up in a ditch. Needless to say, the obvious isn't so obvious.

I would only listen to one track per session. I think everybody would advise this. Listen to a track, get up and ground yourself and then maybe listen to another one later on.

Hello Everyone,
<br>
<br>
My question pertains to the "gateway" series as well as the
<br>
brain wave mind voyages CD's.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone found any possible negative side effects to
<br>
mechanically altering your brain waves on a regular basis?
<br>
<br>
I realize that it happens on a small level every day, in everything
<br>
you do, and that eventually you naturally learn to adopt this highly
<br>
achievable state, however, there have been times in the last 9 months
<br>
that after using the CD's off and on I'll have a residual brain tingle that can last
<br>
for up to 2-3 days and is not so much uncomfortable as it is disturbing.
<br>
Barring this possible "side effect" I feel they have helped alot, along with
<br>
NEW and several hours humping that ROPE I've had about 9 OBE's
<br>
(5 with the CD aid, 4 without)
<br>
<br>
Of course, any fan of NEW could attribute it to new pathways opening
<br>
up as it does *kind* of feel like a stimulated energy port in my temple,...but,
<br>
less comfortable.
<br>
<br>
Basically I'm about to start using the gateway series and was just curious
<br>
if this was my own cross to bear, or if this was common.
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Wonderboy
<br>
<br>

Forgive me for being so direct, but I think your problem is, you are not engaging your imagination. That's why you are falling asleep and that's why nothing is happening when you don't. Please realise that track1, CD2 is a very potent tool. But like all tools, it has to be used properly to get the best out of it.
<br>
<br>
Okay, tell me what are you imagining when you go from the energy conversion box to Focus 3?

hello there, just thought I'd let you guys know - I tried the focus 10 exercise for the 5th time last night at about 4am.
<br>
<br>
However, this time I laid down on my SIDE, the most comfortable position that I assume when going to sleep. I had a pre-conceived notion that you have to lie on your back, but I kept getting distracted by discomfort in my neck....anyway, I found it much easier to concentrate on the task at hand - I felt my body was completely asleep, with my mind awake. I've still got to work on forgetting about my body completely, so I couldn't progress..
<br>
<br>
So, I turned off the CD, lay down to go back to sleep. I found it tricky to do this. It was at this point that I remembered Jeff Mash describing how he passively observed himself going to sleep. After a few minutes of doing this, vibrations began, I could feel one of my legs "seperate".
<br>
<br>
I tried to just relax into it and go with the flow; nothing was really happening, but the vibrations were becoming a buzz, my heart was pounding more quickly. Then, all of a sudden, there was what I can only describe as an Inaudible "pop", .....and then, nothing !! I was still lying in bed, in a normal waking state.
<br>
<br>
Ah well....I shall keep persevering !!!
<br>
<br>
ps : Franks quote :
<br>
"Okay, tell me what are you imagining when you go from the energy conversion box to Focus 3?"
<br>
<br>
In my case, I was trying to concentrate on an image that I could see behind my eyelids, I think that Mr. Jeff Mash mentioned this in one of his posts.

I just wanted to say how happy I am to hear of your experience.  You were right.....the thing I do is be passive and focus on an image behind my closed eyelids.
<br>
<br>
You know, ever since Frank mentioned how THIN the buffer zone is between the imagination and the astral, I have been having a lot of success lately.
<br>
<br>
You see, whenever I close my eyes when I lay down, I usually see a bunch of fleeting images.  They go this way and that, and usually disappear with 1-2 seconds.  Sound familiar?  I consider these images to be conjured up by my imagination.
<br>
<br>
However, after I get relaxed, I start seeing more stable images.  These images don't disappear quite as quickly, and they start to take on a 3 dimensional feel to them.  I believe that this is where you start to approach the buffer zone and begin to see things in the astral realm.  I could be wrong, but this line if thinking keeps me focused enough to recognize just how far along I am in my projection technique.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps Frank would agree with this line of thinking?  All I know is that there appears to be a clear difference between the quick, fleeting images when I first lay down, and the more solid, multidimensional images as I go further into my meditation/trance state.

<section>
whoa are you guys talking about images behind your closed eyelids?? That'd be neat ... normally my imagination only takes part in my head ... I mean I can 'vizualize' pretty good, but it's all 'up there' in my head, not actually in fron of my closed eyelids.
<br>
That kind of stuff only happend once in a while when my point of awareness shifts from my eyes to my head completely, like the onset of a WILD (usually I only get pictures that last a split.second before I realize I am dreaming and wake up) ...

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
I look forward to Frank's new thread on this - it would be excellent for a new forum under poll as well - but the jury is out on that one.
<br>
<br>
We are advised from many sources that imagination is extremely important and powerful  - particularly for Astral work, but also in higher levels.
<br>
<br>
That does not mean that everything is a figment of your imagination, I think to that extent that imagination is probably wrongly interpreted. A better expression might be "conceptualising" - but any way, imagination it is a way of communicating intentions and bringing about desires in a way.
<br>
<br>
Communication in non-physical realms is significantly by imagery, telepathy etc., and of course it is also the language of creating out of Astral matter.
<br>
<br>
All in all anyway, true imagination is very important, and I look forward to Frank's words of wisdom on this one

Jeff, yes, it's the point where it becomes 3D that you are right on the edge. I think you are very much more "visual" than a lot of us. All I see when I close my eyes is blackness. My experience on this is more like Xehupatl's desciption of it being in one's head. But there have been times when all I have seen is blackness, but then the blackness has taken on a 3D effect.

Frank,
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean.  When I FIRST lay down, all I see is blackness with occasional flickers of light.  I attribute that to after image effects...something we all experience after closing our eyes after using them all day long.
<br>
<br>
When you said, "the blackness has taken on a 3D effect," this is EXACTLY what I am referring to!  Although I didn't quite word it that way.  This blackness would start to "clump" sometimes into a shape.  This shape, when I stare at it, begins to draw me into it.  I believe it is at this moment that, as long as I go with it, I continue to shift into the astral realm.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, during this "drawing in process,"  I usually become aware of it happening, and I'm back in the RTZ, where I proceed to roll out of my body and move about that way.
<br>
<br>
The more I get to this threshold point, though, the better I'm getting at it.

Forgive me for butting in, but I just discovered this forum today.  I am very impressed.

Anyway among other things I have studied at the Monroe Institute and become a low-level instructor, licensed only to teach their weekend "Gateway Excursion" class.  In doing that I had to study their material a bit, and can at least try to say what the TMI line is on various topics.
<br>

I am delighted to learn that focus 10 has been useful as a launching point for OBE's, if I am reading correctly.  I think I will dig out my old Focus 10 tape and give it another go this weekend!

Tisha, this happens to me occasionally too!  Except by the time it happens, instead of going along with it, my mind goes, "Oh hey, that little light looks like its getting bigger!"
<br>
<br>
And with that, it disappears and I am back in the darkness!  Whenever I get to that stage though, I'm consciously aware that I am on the right path.  This is because I am now visually experiencing things that I am not creating, and I recognize that fact.  If I allow myself to remain calm, I go further and further without losing the image.

At the beginning of this exercise, just after the resonant tuning, I perceived a soft green light filling the space in front of me for a short time.  This gradually changed into a shade of purple for a while.  There was a slight smell of fish briefly after this.  The exercise continued to the Focus 3 state.  At this point I started to get bouncing sensations that felt at first like floating on a wave of water that seemed to be flowing from my feet up towards my head.  As the exercise progressed, this changed in form gradually and became like a sensation of bouncing up and down on a trampoline.  It seemed at times that this bouncing was going as high as the ceiling, and at other times just a little way up.  This was accompanied, at the start, by a static electricity like feeling in my face that went in rhythm with the bouncing sensations.  As the muscle relaxation continued towards Focus 10, the bouncing gradually changed, with the height of the bouncing reducing and the intensity increasing until it felt like rapid vibrations with a more subtle inwards and outwards sensation in rhythm with my breathing.  After the end of the exercise, I remained in Focus 10 for some time to see where it would lead.  The vibrating sensations continued in a similar way as before, though it now took on a less rigid rhythm and followed its own pattern.  At times I imagined moving through tunnels or floating in clouds.  At times I could vaguely perceive cloud like patterns in front of me.  I continued with this for about an hour and then decided to return to normal consciousness.

Interesting, it sounds to me like you were at what I call the "stray energy" stage. I get this just before making contact with the Astral proper. Also, the sensations of bouncing and static feelings tend to come about when the head and chest energy centres are activated. It sounds like you were right on the verge of projection, in fact you probably were for a time, but not with any great deal of awareness.
<br>
<br>
Is this the first time this has happened?

I've been trying a combination of the Gateway cds, Robert Bruce's spreadsheet workbook from this site and a few other cds like Transcendence and Astral Trance since about the beginning of 2002.
<br>
<br>
My experiences have gradually developed, and each exercise now has a few common features:
<br>
<br>
- At the beginning of exercises, a sensation of coloured lights filling the space in front of me behind closed eyelids, usually either green or purple. Tends to take the form of a sort of illuminated mist.
<br>
<br>
- Sometimes a distinctive smell of some sort for a short time.
<br>
<br>
- Vibrations starting with a slow bouncing up and down effect, then gradually moving on to a more rapid type of vibrating sensation
<br>
<br>
- Numbness in arms, legs and face.
<br>
<br>
- Occasionally scenery of some sort will appear for a brief instant, usually less than a second. Typically a city scene, another planet type scene or countryside scenery. One time a grey room with a stalagmite in the middle appeared. Another time, a game environment appeared for a few seconds.  On three occasions to date I saw one of Robert Bruce's so-called astral plane entrance structures for about a second. The first one was like a blue wallpaper with white tulip like patterns in it.
<br>
<br>
These types of experiences now happen in most of the projection exercises I try and typically continue until I decide to return to normal consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I get the impression that I'm almost at the point of being able to project but just not quite sure how to take the final step of actually getting out of my body.

I think what you might try is forgeting all ideas of getting out of your body and think more of mentally stepping into the imagery you are seeing.
<br>
<br>
I am pretty certain that you are at what I call the "stray energy" stage and the fleeting glimpses of various scenes are of the Astral. What you describe is basically the same as what happens to me.
<br>
<br>
Next time you are at that stage, have an intent to go somewhere in particular. Keep it simple like, imagine sitting by a lake, or just looking out over the ocean. Just something basic.
<br>
<br>
"Intent" is what makes you travel. I think what you are doing is (mentally) standing on the brink, uncertain of what to do, and it is the release of that uncertainty which is causing the flitting from one scene to another.
<br>
<br>
My idea is, if you can gather a definite intent, that should cause a fixed scene to appear. Then you should feel a kind of attraction that makes it easy for you to mentally step into that scene. Then you are there, basically.
<br>

Yes, it seems as if this is the case.  It seems to be in the nature of this experience that actually trying to get out of body stops it from happening to a certain extent.  The occasions when I've come closest to success are when I've just been resting and have come close to falling asleep.
<br>
<br>
Over the weekend I tried the Astral Trance cd a few times.  This cd features a sort of guided meditation that involves first relaxation, then visualising the energy body, then imagining using your astral hands to throw up and catch an energy ball. This cd was very good and I felt I came quite close to having an oobe with it.
<br>
<br>
I also tried adding visualisation to the focus states with gateway.  I imagined focus 10 to be a large square room, and focus 12 then took me up towards a rooftop area open to the sky.  This did seem to enhance the experience of the focus states.
<br>
<br>
Tonight I'll try visualising a simple scene with one of the exercises to see if that helps.

You need to get an idea of what it is you want to experience on the Astral. Make sure you don't have any kind of ego-attachment to the outcome, like, wanting to know this Saturday's lottery numbers.

Keep it simple and to the point. And develop the intent throughout the day while in C1. Then, when you get to the stray energy stage, let go and trust in those that are helping you (your Spirit guides)

 and simply allow the experience to unfold
