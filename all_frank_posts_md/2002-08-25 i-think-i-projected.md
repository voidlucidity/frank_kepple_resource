<section>
hello to the people
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
i again became aware during the projection process as i woke up this morning  to  the incredible inner sounds and a pulsating brain.
<br>
<br>
I focused on  my brain and  the next thing i was at the bottom of my street,  although  the only sense i could persieve was sight,  i could only hear the sound of my own breathing (which was rapid due to my first obe)
<br>
<br>
the first thing i did was jump,  when i did i floated up in the air and for some reason i couldnt get back down,  i was stuck.
<br>
<br>
Then i woke up in my body and scribbled down what just happned.
<br>
<br>
**** another odd thing is that before i appeared at the bottom of my street there seemed to be some  "novice-projectee monitors"   i remeber them  taking notes and looking at me as the experience began.
<br>
Then they handed me a ticket  telling me that my brain was in the   "LILITHALUM" region.
<br>
I  assume  they were trying to tell  me what "level"  i was at in my projected double,   most likely it was low as my experience was not at all vivid.
<br>
Or thought forms but either are merely speculation****

Well done, not only did you project but you are open to the possibility of guides (which means you will progress faster).
<br>
<br>
From what you say, you have several working on you full-time. It never ceases to amaze me how creative they can be: novice-projectee monitors. LOL, that's excellent.
<br>
<br>
If you are open to them, guides will approach you in a way that you will best accept. With me, they approach with no airs or graces. Just plain and straightforward, with no surprises. If you had suddenly been met by some stranger, chances are, the fear of that happening would have zipped you back to the Physical with a jolt.
<br>
<br>
But in the event it became just a casual thing, like, "Oh don't mind us, we're just novice-projectee monitors". Which fools your protective sense of conscious awareness into thinking, "Well, that's alright then. Phew, for a moment there I thought you might be the dreaded negs."
<br>
<br>
You see, there is a MAJOR difference between chatting on a BBS about projection and having guides approach you, and so forth: and
<i>
 actually
</i>
having it happen to you. Most people would be scared sh*tless. I know when the inkling of having some Astral entity around me came about the very first time (as I became open to the idea) and even though it was something I wanted, I was *still* very nervous about the whole thing.
<br>
<br>
The reason for the ticket and the word, is two fold: 1) it makes the the whole situation appear more real hence more genuine; and 2) it stimulates your curiosity, so you remember it more vividly once back in the physical. Again, I take my hat off to their creativity.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

<section>
thanks for the kind words alpha and frank.
<br>
<br>
since that morning i have pondered weather it was remote viewing and not projection,   i couldnt see or even feel a body,  i was  simply a point of consiousness which could see.
<br>
From  the literature ive read this seems more like remote viewing than an OBE-   but the monitors do not seem like a remote viewing "accesory" if you will.
<br>
If they were real entities and not thought forms i am glad as i  feel  i have aroused there curiosity with my spiritual development.
<br>
<br>
alpha, lilithalum was the best mental picture i could come up with when i awoke concerning the ticket i recieved,  it may be inaccurate but it may be spot on,  hence the word may not exist.

congradulations! Projecting can get really weird-last ime I almost projected I tuned into some radio station.I think it gets weird because we are tresspassing into an area where our concious mind does not belong.

RM: It does not pay to spend too much time in the Physical pondering over your Astral experiences. People make that mistake all the time (including myself, at first). What you can tend to do is compare "what happened there" with "what normally happens here". But the two are not compatible.
<br>
<br>
It's like me saying, "But I can fly on the Astral by simply taking off, why can't I do that on the Physical? Nope, I cannot accept the Physical is real. Because, if it were, then I should be able to fly."
<br>
<br>
You see, think of a person who normally resides on the Astral coming to the Physical. You could think exactly the same way. It's just that the Physical is our normal yardstick, not the Astral. What you have to accept is the Physical and the Astral are two very different states of matter. As such, one cannot directly compare with the other.
<br>
<br>
Yes, they do connect in some way. But direct comparisons simply make the whole thing too confusing. The way around this, is to gain a better degree of control; to the extent where you will be able to speak directly to the Astral entities who are obviously helping you. They will be able to answer all your questions.
<br>
