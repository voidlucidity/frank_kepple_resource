<section>
This morning I had a very disturbing emotional dream that was so vivid and real¡¦ it litterally felt like I was in another world.  After I had woken up earlier I went to the bathroom, then went back to bed and closed my eyes to sleep a bit more.
<br>
<br>
I open my eyes on a sunny beach laying on a beach blanket.  I feel the warmth of the sun and the smell of the salt air and the sand under my blanket.  Next to me on the blanket is a pretty petite blond girl in a bikini.  I look at her, then look around and say, "Where am I?".  She looks at me worriedly and says, "California".  I get the sense from her that she is somewhat used to me having these spells of forgetfulness¡¦ like I do this on a frequent basis.  I say, "but why am I in California?  I live in Seattle.  Where is Angie?".  As I say this I'm starting to remember little details.  She says, "you moved here, you are in California now.".  I say, "but I work at the university."  she says, "haha you only worked there for a day before you won the lottery.".  I then have a memory come back to me.  I had moved here to California and gotten a job at the local University but just the next day I had won the local lottery and quit the job.  I ask again, "where¡¦ where is Angie?... Did¡¦ did I tell you about Angie?"¡¦ a dread is growing deep inside me as I say this.  The girl says, "yes, you've told me many times¡¦ she is dead." she says to me softly looking at me with what seems like genuine and deep empathy for my pain.  Then I go into an intense flashback (within the dream) of seeing Angie in a car reck and dying.  I begin sobbing and wailing so loud it's like my entire being is racked with pain and torture.  The dream fades and I'm in my bed¡¦ the bed in this world sobbing my heart out.
<br>
<br>
Was this a visit to another reality? i don't know... i certainly hope it wasn't this (my timeline) future.

Hi Chris:
<br>
<br>
I am surely a neophyte but will give you my impression of your experience.  Some believe linear time as we know it is non-existent,  and that all time exists NOW as past, present and future simultaneously.  You are a spiritual being having a physical experience and who is to say that you aren't living multiple experiences simultaneously?  What better way for your Higher Self to accumulate knowledge from this school of learning known as Earth than to live as Chris in Seattle in 2003, as Christophe in France in 1801 and as Cristo in Mexico in 1705.  Why not another Chris in California in the 21st century?  The very fact that you frequent a forum such as this would indicate to me that you are a seeker and may already hold the key to visiting the alternate realities which are your realities in another life.
<br>
<br>
It's possible the Chris of your other life is experiencing the deep sorrow of losing Angie, so that you will learn to love her so much more in this life.

Thanks for the feedback.  Interesting thoughts indeed.  Yes, I've spent a lot of time in what seem like other worlds or realities.  This is the first time however that it has been so emotionally disturbing.  It felt like maybe the Chris I am now was somehow seeping through into the Chris I was there.  To an individual seeing the Chris there it would seem like the Chris there was flipping out, had lost his mind and memory, emotionally disturbed, or even possibly Schizophrenic.  Who knows, could Schizophrenics here and now sometimes be some sort of bleed through of a personality from another reality?

This could be a sign you are making progress, I too have been researching the notion of multiple lives in multiple time-frames and have discovered there are a number of "me". Reason why I say you could be making progress is because, at first, I would experience these other lives from a distance. The contact was more telepathic in nature. I'd suddenly get these flashes of abstract visions which would arouse my curiosity more and more.
<br>
<br>
After a while I got to being able to step into one of these lives and experience events from the point of view of that person. Problem is, you also get to feeling their emotional state which can often be a bit screwed. There is an aspect of me who is living the life of a gangster, drug-baron type of setup. Unfortunately, when I came across him at his home he was being surrounded by the police. The feeling of sheer dread this unfortunate guy was feeling took me several
<u>
 days
</u>
to shake off!
<br>
<br>
At first I thought these lives were being played out within the Astral somewhere, say, in the region of F24 to F26. But no, it does appear to be the case (as many people believe like PJ pointed out) there are, in fact, God knows however many multiple systems of physical-reality universes all being played out simultaneously. Which is a quite fantastic notion, and something I'm finding ever so difficult to get my head around.
<br>
<br>
The idea of a Chris-there being viewed by another individual-there as being a bit mental is very likely IMO. And it does throw quite a different light on how we-here view people with mental illnesses. It also brings up a number of questions as to what extent basic details of our current lives have been determined by other lives. I give an example of this with my own life below.
<br>
<br>
I can't quite tell from the wording of your original post whether you do, in fact, live in Seattle with a person called Angie and have a job at the university. If you do, then I wondered if it may be the case your current life was chosen by you in some way to "heal" that one.
<br>
<br>
What I'm finding is the other aspects of "me" I came across thus far, have basic characteristics in common. The actual lifestyle may be radically different. Like, I have nothing whatever in common with a drugs-baron, come gangster. But it's the underlying characteristics which can often be very similar.
<br>
<br>
I do wonder, also, if this personality provides an interesting answer to the question of why I've always been dead-set against taking drugs? Though don't get me wrong, I'm not some anti-drugs campaigner on a mission or anything. What people do with their body is not my concern. It's just that I've always had this strong feeling taking drugs was something I should avoid.
<br>
<br>
In a similar vein, I wondered if you currently have any natural aversions that may be classed as "bleed through" from another personality? Like, maybe, an aversion to playing the lottery.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey reading this post I thought if there were multiple realities, one might tend to think the consciousness they are now was the dominant one. The "True" version.
<br>
<br>
But if you think about it, another version of you might be thinking of the same thing and feeling the same way, that they are the "true" or "real" version. So its kind of interesting thinking of another version of you living in another reality finding you, and viewing you.
<br>
<br>
It is an interesting thought to entertain, that of all the possible actions we could make in our lives, there is a reality for, and then for all the different outcomes of our different actions there would be more realities. There would be so many.
<br>
<br>
Chris, I dont know if your experience was a visit to another reality, only you could say since it was your experience.

Personally, I find it absolutely mind-boggling!
<br>
<br>
Longer-term members will perhaps have heard me mention about my regular guide Harath. I now know he is a future aspect of "me" living in another physical-reality universe who came to find the "me" living in this physical-reality universe. It's all absolutely incredible stuff.
<br>

<section>
Awesome:)
<br>
<br>
That would be so fun, imagine it, in the "future" I reakon I would enjoy coming and guiding myself. I wonder what it would be like.
<br>
<br>
lol, I love life, whatever it is.
<br>
Existing... everything, I love it:)
<br>
<br>
A thought I've had is that at one point after everything everywhere has finished the whole life thing maybe it would do something else. But what else is there, but who knows.. its hard to think of something that isnt life.
<br>
<br>
Frank, its very true, once you get yourself going, there are a lot of mind-boggling things!

All very interesting comments guys and yes they are mind boggling!  I've had an experience where a future (two years from that date) version of me came and helped me out of my body.  I looked at him/me and saw my own face smiling back at me.  He/me responded to me just like me with my sense of humor and sarcasm etc.  It was really amazing. He/me was just there to help me out of my body and then let me go off on my own.  It was very very very strange talking to myself like it's a different separate entity... but all of my experiences have only emphasized that the reality is that consciousness can both divide and act independently, or unify and act as one entity.  I've experienced the melding or unifying of many parts of myself from other lives and realities as well... that was truly an amazing experience.  Have either of you had similar experiences?

<br>
<br>
I havent had any experiences like that, that I am aware of anyway.
<br>
It must have been quite something!
<br>
<br>
Have you gotten to the point in time where you go back and pull yourself out of your body in the past? That must be really amazing to experience something in one point in time consciousness, and then later experience it again in another time consciousness.

No, I haven't had that experience yet.  Either it's farther in the future to happen, it already has and I didn't remember the experience, or it was another aspect of me from another reality incarnation.  Who knows.

Chris,  you misposted this, it should be in prophesy and divination. My advise? you should warn Angie immediately.

Nah, I put it here on purpose.  I did warn Angie though.  One of the things I got from it was that the incident occured at night while she was driving.  There was something on the road she swerved to avoid that caused the accident, and it occured on the 25th day of some month.  I've asked to her drive more carefully especially at night. I'm a firm believer that the future is not set in stone and if what I saw was a future, it was only a possible or probable future which may have now been completely altered by the steps she is taking to be a more cautious driver.
