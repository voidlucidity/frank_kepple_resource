I'm reproducing this here because several times now I posted on the B.Moen BBS about how posters there might seek some advantage in coming here and having a look.
<br>
<br>
The following post is reproduced in full (without permission) but I'm sure Mr Moen will understand the value in what I am trying to put across, like, the feeling is reciprocated:

JimB,
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Bruce . . . your method is good for exploring the 'afterlife' areas only. Bob Monroe's methods seems good for exploring both the afterlife Focus levels and physical reality. &lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
The method I teach, Focused Attention, can be used to explore any reality: afterlife; physical; nonphysical or others. That's because all my method requires is that one learn to shift their focus of attention to the reality they are interested in, and "look around." And, the method utilizes the assistance of Helpers to assist in doing that.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Bob Monroe was able to explore this Solar System and much of the universe and the afterlife areas as well. &lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
He was also able to explore realities, or dimensions, beyond the Afterlife and physical universe. He used the term Focus level to catagorize these and his division lines were based on the kind of "people" found in a specific area of consciousness or Focus level. I use the term "people" loosely as Bob would have labeled some of them "intelligences."
<br>
<br>
I see Bob's personal method as classic OBE. The methods that he developed using Hemi-sync were probably orginally intended to teach folks how to do classic OBE, that's just my opinion. But, not everyone can learn the OBE technique quickly and easily, and Bob discovered that it wasn't necessary that they do. They could use Hemi-sync to shift their awareness to various focus levels without having to develop OBE skills, and still successfully explore.
<br>
<br>
I see what I teach as a simplified version of Bob's Hemi-sync based exploration, without the Hemi-sync. The primary difference I see between what I teach and what Bob taught is that he started from a classic OBE perspective and I don't because I can't. He explored that way and I never could learn how. Fortunately, there are a lot more people who can't learn OBE than can. So, my simplified method makes exploration beyond physical reality available to a wider range of people. In my view what I'm doing is building upon what Bob developed to make such exploration more widely available.
<br>
<br>
So, the method I teach comes from the perspective of someone who can't do the classic OBE method, and gets into the nitty gritty details. In TMI's Lifeline program, for example, a method of verification of the retrieval experiences as real was not included until very recently. Finding ways to verify contact and communication as real is a nitty gritty detail that's critical to long term success, in my view. I've been pushing for TMI to develop a Partnered Exploring program for years as a way of routinely getting verification of experience. Maybe some day they'll do that.
<br>
<br>
Part of the nitty gritty is that beliefs we hold that conflict with the existence of an afterlife, or other nonphysical realities, block perception of those areas of consciousness. To open perception those beliefs must be confronted with verifiable, conflicting evidence from one's own direct experience, again, my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Once enough verifiable evidence has been gathered individuals typically go through an identity crisis, a belief system crash, that results in having a different world view, and more open perception. As a method of exploration Focused Attention covers this nitty gritty detail.
<br>
<br>
In a recent post by Dora, the Devil's Island post, another nitty gritty detail is illustrated, Interpreter Overlay. Understanding this concept is critical to successful exploration.
<br>
<br>
I can see how there can be some confusion about the areas or realities Focused Attention can be used to explore. I teach afterlife exploration because it presents the opportunity for verifiable, belief clearing, experiences. Afterlife exploration via retrieval is like training wheels on a bicycle. Once you get the hang of riding around the Afterlife the training wheels can come off and you can ride your bike to any reality or dimension.

What I wonder about sometimes though is that its ok to 'place intent' to go somewhere on the astral, however, if you have never experienced the astral its hard to know where to go or what to do, do you see where I'm coming from?
<br>
<br>
I think that some beginners might get stuck with this early stage as they wouldn be very sure what they wanted to do.

How far can one travel in OBE? You mentioned Bob exlored the solar system. Would it be possible to explore something as far away as a distant star, such as Centauri Alpha?

Yes, you are quite right and I see exactly where you are coming from. Which is why I am a great fan of the Phasing process as it introduces a person gently, by giving them a step-by-step process they can follow. People from the Moen school are taught to initially try and make contact with people who were close to them while Physical. Well, that's what I can gather from the various bits and bobs that I have read.
<br>
<br>
What they do is travel along the thread of an imaginary circumstance where they see themselves meeting an ex-relative, for example. Then just go along with that until some situation comes about that was not "on their script" so to speak.
<br>
<br>
Another way I now use all the time is to keep asking other members of your Astral family for whatever it is you need. But at first take things in small doses. Like, please don't just lie there and say, "take me to the Astral now". Rather, as you perceive the blackness in mind, simply introduce yourself to those who are guiding you with a simple, friendly hello.
<br>
<br>
If you can push aside all the stuff that gets in the way, which is all mainly doubt-based, then you should be able to contact your higher-self directly. But maybe it would be best to contact another Astral family-member first, as they tend to be a tad more human-friendly when it comes to communicating and giving assistance.
<br>
<br>
As you lie there perceiving the blackness, you will gradually phase out of the physical more. At the same time you should notice that the blackness can become as if it were more fluid in nature. Maybe you might perceive an area that looks a little grey; perhaps you just thought there was a streak of something that just went on overhead; maybe there was a slight swirling to the left; or you might get the notion of some kind of light switched on behind you... but you can't quite grasp what it is.
<br>
<br>
Other effects you can come across are where the blackness seems to take on a kind of texture. With me there's a grainy sort of texture which often comes about. B.Moen talks of a velvety-blackness which I experience often. All these are signs that you are phasing progessively more towards the Astral.
<br>
<br>
While this is happening keep up a simple dialogue with your guide. Okay, it may seem like you are talking to yourself (at first) but ignore that feeling and push on. As you perceive these changes in the blackness, imagine them as "signs" that are being presented to you by a guide in order that you are able to sense you are making progress. So keep up a simple dialogue with them and ask for more help in going deeper within yourself.
<br>
<br>
Things you typically ought to be saying are as follows. Okay, you will have to make big allowances for the fact that the pointers are in my words, not yours. So if you try this for yourself, take my words as giving you the general gist of it only. Then put the whole thing in your own words.....
<br>
<br>
Hello, Douglas here, and this morning I'd like a lesson in perceiving the different kinds of blackness.
<br>
<br>
Allow me to get into a relaxed position... there... that's nice and comfy. Now I'm ready to begin.
<br>
<br>
Yes, I see the 2D blackness but how about a texture or two.
<br>
<br>
Hmm, not really perceiving anything my end... wait... there was a streak of something, thanks I got that.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if there was an odd swirling sensation around to the left just then.
<br>
<br>
Yes, I just saw that rippling texture come and go.
<br>
<br>
Ah, now I just observed some kind of swirling foggy light top-right.
<br>
<br>
"Correct, Douglas!"
<br>
<br>
And at this point you'll go, "What, hey, wait a minute, I never said that!" Which will typically have the effect of snapping you back to C1.
<br>
<br>
But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this will happen after the first few observations. As I say, I'm just trying to get the gist of what I mean across to you in the simplest way I can think of. You might have to try maybe a dozen times before you get settled into a useful routine.
<br>
<br>
The blackness will eventually take on a 3D aspect. At which point you will also feel yourself coming from the position of actually being within the blackness, as opposed to being an observer.
<br>
<br>
From this point you should be able to phase gradually into the Astral-proper. With me I often find myself transitioning by hovering in the 3D blackness then I'll perceive a swirling in front of me. At the centre of this swirling is a light that gets bigger in diameter to the point where it becomes a kind of tunnel. Then I simply place an intent to travel through the tunnel and it's hello Astral.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

The idea of distance is a physical-realm construct only which is related to the notion of linear time. Within the Astral there is no such thing as time. As a consequence there is no distance either. Okay, while within the Astral things can be perceived as being "in the distance" but that's only the way we see it. Simply by placing an Intent to be at some place is all it takes for you to instantly manifest at whatever place that happens to be.

Cheers Frank. I think I'll give this a try from tonight and follow the simple techninque that you described, maybe for 20-30 minutes before I go to sleep at night. This seems to be the best time for me as I often get odd 'hypnogogic' swirls and other effects in my field of vision when I'm droping off to sleep. As you say, I won't expect imediate results but perhaps after a couple of weeks something interesting might happen!

Hey Douglas,
<br>
<br>
A big thumb's up on Frank's reply to you....and I thought I'd just toss in that I too wondered two years ago what to do with all 'that blackness'....and creating my own special place in Focus 27 really helped. It was a good place to go to in the afterlife with familiar things to relax and feel comfortable with (I initially placed the intent to be in F27...perceived only blackness--no problem-- and then visualized a small park I had loved as a child and just walked into it, complete with bench, pond, trees, flowers etc) and from there I was able to invite Guides, Helpers, deceased relatives and so on. And as Frank pointed out, I just played along with what I suspected was my own fantasy (when certain individuals appeared and communicated) until they started saying/doing things that were not in 'my script', my expectations. Got my attention. And then when I started asking questions which netted replies that held info I had never known about them (deceased relatives, for instance), and I was able to verify such info when back in the physical...well that was the beginning of me *knowing* that the word "death" shouldn't even be in the dictionary. It doesn't exist.
<br>
<br>
Much love...your friend,
<br>
<br>
Ginny
