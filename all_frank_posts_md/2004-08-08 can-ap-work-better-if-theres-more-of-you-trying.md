Just a question.  If there's say, 4 people trying to AP then will it work better than having just yourself?  Will the 4 of you trying for the same thing make the process quicker or easier?

I have no idea, isnt it all about your own meditation so other people around wouldn't matter. Or would it have collective engergy? Why don't you try it? tell us if its easier?

I kinda doubt it. But why not give it a go and see. In my experience of life thus far, the more people who cobble together and attempt a thing, the bigger the mess that's created at the end of it.

I suppose if you had two people who were very close to each other and they embarked on the task then maybe you might see faster results. But AP is not like organising a bucket brigade where the more you have the quicker it flows. It's a deeply personal experience and the more people there are, the more the distraction (IMO).
<br>
<br>
To me, the best way of working is a person working on their own, but having an informed internet forum they can use to compare notes. Now that I can see works wonders. I know if I had that when I first started I would have saved years of trial and error.
<br>

I suppose these days it is trendy to attend classes in subjects such as meditation. Where all these "new age" types hold hands in a circle (or whatever) and start chanting their stuff. I would often talk to several friends of my late wife who would do that kind of thing. They never really got anywhere, but they enjoyed the group experience. Which is why I suspect many of them would go for it.
