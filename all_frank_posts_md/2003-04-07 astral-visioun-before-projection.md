A question.  Many times while meditating and working on my energy body preparing to project, my astral vision starts working and I can see the room around me while my eyes are closed, even turn to look other directions if I focus hard enough. Sometimes I am aware of other figures or forms in the room around me.  They usually do not seem negative mostly just watching me.  Sometimes they are there for a sec when I exit but fade away quickly.  Are these figments of my imagination or actual beings?

Hi Matthew, the same thing happens to me, it's like having xray vision, even tho the eyes are closed you can see everything. I have been wondering if this is already projecting? Never really thought about it until recently. I do know that when I can see with my eyes closed that I  will AP if I do not close myself off.
<br>
<br>
Because of what I have seen I do not think you are hallucinating. Parallel worlds is what I think.
<br>
<br>
take care, Lyn [8D]

Hi, biggymatt,
<br>
That's an interesting experience. Why don't you ask the figures?
<br>
Could you explain the work on your energy body you do before you project?
<br>

There is nothing wrong in what you are perceiving. I'm not sure what the sum total of your experiences have been to date, but people who first start to make progress, for example, are often surprised to see other people about them either at the onset of projection or thereafter. Confusion largely arises because Astral sight, while having common features, is quite different to normal Physical sight. Astral sight has an added dimension which can take quite a bit of getting used to.

well ebb, I usually start stimulating my secondary energy centers and then work on raising energy through out my energy body.  Afterwards I begin on my primary centers as per NEW in Astral Dynamics.  This works extremely well for me. I am also about to post an excerpt from my journal about an energy raising experiance I had in the energy section if anyone would like to read it.

biggymatt,
<br>
<br>
The same thing happens to me with respect to seeing through closed eyelids. I've had to check when this first started happening to make sure my physical eyes were really closed. Now I am beginning to know the difference. Haven't had the experience of figures or forms in the room yet, though.
<br>
<br>
Very Best,

I would like to know what you see, I've experienced this many times before and even before I knew anything about AP.
<br>
<br>
It's usually at night and the room is dark but I can see the room layout which is strange.
<br>
<br>
Maybe I should try when the room is lit!?
