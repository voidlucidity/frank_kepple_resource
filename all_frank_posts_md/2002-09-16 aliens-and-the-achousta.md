Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.

i believe it's akashic, and from what i remember you can access anything you want to. there a good section on it in ad. i think about that place when i'm meditating. when i feel as though i'm an accomplished projector, i'm going to try accessing that place. out of pure curiousity i'd like to find out who stole mycar a few years back. there will be no retaliation, i'd just like to know.

You access these areas (same as any area) by using intent. It's always best to ask for a guide to help you, which makes the process less hit and miss.

As far as I know though, no one has browsed the akashic records to find out about other physical civilisations. This doesnt mean that other civs dont exist, in fact I'm sure they do, but no one has made an attempt to look for them using the akashic records yet.
<br>
Since the akashic records are records of everything that has happened in the physical world this will extend to all the planets of the universe.
<br>
I think a big problem though is that we humans are naturally attuned to records pertaining to Earth and it may be difficult to shift awareness away to look at what's going on anywhere else.
<br>
In fact just being able to get the hang of browsing the records in any degree is a feat for most people.
<br>
<br>
Maybe a more feasable experiment for someone who is interested in other physical civilisations is to browse the records to look for any physical civs visiting earth, (UFO sightings etc), these should show up on the record if looked for.
