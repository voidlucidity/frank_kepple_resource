<section>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I have launched the book and site for
<b>
 Our Ultimate Reality, Life, the Universe and the Destiny of Mankind today
</b>
<br>
<br>
I will repeat the URL again later in this message, but here is
<br>
the URL:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.ourultimatereality.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Our Ultimate Reality
</b>
is the culmination of over 2 years writing
<br>
based on my own seeking, experiences and knowledge over the course
<br>
of 40 years. During that time I have been priveledged to have
<br>
learned a tremendous amount from many diverse sources. Our Ultimate
<br>
Reality now brings the benefit of those 40+ years to its readers
<br>
over the course of 684 pages and 144 chapters.
<br>
<br>
Although the book flows seamlessly from beginning to end it is also
<br>
a reference work for many valuable abilitities such as Astral
<br>
Projection, OBE, Healing, Concentration, Attracting Wealth and
<br>
much, much more. I have included a fill list of chapters at the end
<br>
of this newsletter.
<br>
<br>
By buying Our Ultimate Reality you will immediately benefit from
<br>
what I have personally learned, practiced and achieved over the
<br>
last 40 years, much of which you can out into practice immediately
<br>
to achieve results in the next 40 days!
<br>
<br>
Of particular interest, based on the many emails I receive on this
<br>
subject, will be my best 3 methods for achieving Astral projection
<br>
and OBE. While success cannot be guaranteed, being subject to so
<br>
many different variables, not the least of which is personal
<br>
commitment, I can say that in my opinion these methods provide the
<br>
very best chance so far of achieving Astral projection and OBE.
<br>
<br>
I am also offering for a time three valuable additional bonuses:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Abyss:
</b>
This is a binaural brainwave synchronisation MP3 for use
<br>
with meditation, Astral Projection, OBE, Healing, Manifestaion and
<br>
many other things. Abyss first appeared in its original form over 2
<br>
years ago, but since then has evolved considerably into a state of
<br>
the art binaural brainwave entrainment MP3 that has been developed
<br>
not only based on the feedback of many people, but also based on
<br>
the detailed analysis of many other well known, and expensive
<br>
binaural products out here. Abyss incorporates the best of them all!
<br>
Abyss can be used for a range of purposes, including but not
<br>
 limited to meditation, wealth, health, Astral projection, OBE and
 <br>
  much more. Abyss perfectly compliments the main book.
  <br>
   <br>
    <b>
     The Power of Concentration:
    </b>
    The ability to concentrate effectively
    <br>
    is an absolutely crucial prerequisite to achieving anything at all
    <br>
    of real, long-term value. The truth of this most important fact of
    <br>
    this cannot be underestimated.This exceptional book, The Power of
    <br>
    Concentration, was originally written by Theron Dumont in 1918, but
    <br>
    the information and teachings therein are as valid today as ever.
    <br>
    This is what the author himself says about concentration: "Success
    <br>
    is assured when you are able to concentrate, for you are then able
    <br>
    to utilize for your good all constructive thoughts and shut out all
    <br>
    the destructive ones. It is of the greatest value to be able to
    <br>
    think only that which will be beneficial."
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>
     A Guide to Psychic Defense:
    </b>
    It is a shocking yet true fact that we
    <br>
    are all constantly subject to psychic attacks by many different
    <br>
    different types and levels from inner and psychic beings and
    <br>
    forces.  These attacks range from unintentional attacks by people
    <br>
    with forceful personalities such as some sales people, friends,
    <br>
    relatives and partners, through full demonic possession. This is a
    <br>
    more serious issue than people realize! In A Guide to Psychic
    <br>
    Defense you will learn everything you need to know about all forms
    <br>
    of psychic attack, how to prevent it, and what you can do if you
    <br>
    have been attacked.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am truly humbled and honoured by the amazing feedback I have
    <br>
    received from those people who have read Our Ultimate Reality, and
    <br>
    can only hope that everyone finds the book of equal value.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to the book, I am delighted to launch a brand new
    <br>
    forums resource dedicated to the subjects covered in the book.
    <br>
    These forums will be very focussed and highly moderated from the
    <br>
    outset by some of the moderators you are already familiar with and
    <br>
    who do such exceptional work at the Astral Pulse. Quality is the
    <br>
    emphasis from the outset, and all membership applications will be
    <br>
    approved by myself. I hope to see many of you there!
    <br>
    <br>
    As always I really appreciate all suggestions that in any way
    <br>
    improve the quality of the forums for the benefit of everyone.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also very much appreciate comments on the newsletter and in
    <br>
    particular what you would like to see included in the future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once again The URL of the new site is:
    <br>
    <br>
    <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
     http://www.ourultimatereality.com
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    And thank you once again for your wonderful support, and I hope to
    <br>
    see you at the new forums as well as here as ever!
    <br>
    <br>
    Best regards,
    <br>

Thank you very much indeed for your interest in the book.
<br>
<br>
Thebook is only available in eBook format at this time. The type quality on screen is however very high, in fact I spent quite some time in ensuring this.
<br>
<br>
eBook format also has many other advantages such as the abilty to add comments, highlights, bookmarks etc., and I will be offering all future updates to existing customers for free; something that cannot be done in hard copy format.
<br>

Best regards,

<br>
Thank you for your question.
<br>
<br>
I agree that there are many books on these matters, however they are very "isolated" in that they are not completely in the context of our ultimate destiny as Spiritual beings. Some teach certain aspects, some discuss meditation, healing etc., but usually in isolation in that they might show you how to do something but now why it works.
<br>
<br>
Our Ultimate Reality covers everything you need to know, and all in context so it makes complete sense, and all over the course of 686 pages as a single reference.  Reading the book from beginning to end will show you how everything fits into the grand scheme of things. I wrote it as the only book you will ever need to own, and according to the considerable feedback I have received I seem to have succeeded in that objective.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

At times wandering back to this forum, I stumbled upon this book. Very interesting, so I followed some links for more info. Now I do have a question.
<br>
<br>
I wonder why, at the page where they tell how good the book is (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com/book1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 here
</a>
), they use a script that changes the date above Adrian's letter. Its the thingy that starts with:

However, yesterday it said Aug, 10, and tomorrow it will say, aug 12, etc.
<br>

ps: I read that it was available as ebook, but not anymore?

hi xetrov,
<br>
My name is Adam Baker how are you? i bought the e-book our ultimate reality a week ago and it has answered so many questions i have had and so many i never thought existed, the book is everything it says it its and more. i have no doughts that if you decide to get it that u will be more than satisfied. It is 686 pages of absoloute bliss to read and everything in it makes total sense and gives me and probably everyone else who has read it more guidance than anything they have read before in their life in regards to why we are truly here and how we are meant to  to live, love and have anything we want.

Given the quality (and nature) of the book, Adrian would have most certainly forgotten to remove the script and I'm sure that he will fix it as soon he read about your remark.
<br>
<br>
About what adamscottbaker said, I do agree with him. The book contains a lot of topics that I found very interesting and informative. The text is well structured and understandable. It deals with many aspects of the wider reality, you will definitely like it. Sometimes, I come back to it to reread some chapters which inspire me.

Yeah well, i am familiar with it, I just think it's pretty weird to see a book on the meaning of life and spirituality and then see those "unfair tricks", this way it looks like making money is more important then educating people??

<section>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your kind remarks about my book.
<br>
<br>
The date in the information page is not in any way intended to be a "trick". I do intend, very soon to increase the price of the book and also withdraw the bonuses. When I do this the deadline will be midnight.
<br>
<br>
I do not want a situation where many people have been considering purchasing the book suddenly go back to find the price has increased and bonuses withdrawn. So doing things this way puts the necessary degree of urgency on the situation and I am satisfied that people have been advised. If there was a better way of doing this I would do it.
<br>
<br>
I would say that the feedback from the people who have bought the book has been nothing short of exceptional and most gratifying. I do offer a full 90 day money back guarantee of course so there is no risk for anyone regardless of why they purchased the book, but the refund requests are almost non-existtent, and those that do occur are mostly for technical reasons and not sue to the quality of the book itself.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

If you dont mind my humble opinion, I think there is a better way to do this. You could write on that info page exactly what you wrote in your last reply here (that the price will go up soon), so that people who want to buy the book know that they better buy it soon, since the price will go up, and extras will be dropped. This is a honest way of openly informing potential customers of the situation, something I know you would want to do. The script just looks weird and I have to say, does not very well fit the purpose you intent it to have.
<br>
<br>
Also, if I may say so, the fact that you refer so often to what people desire, a reference to the egoistic nature of the unenlightened human kind ("Do you wish you could have everything you could possibly desire?") seems somewhat odd to me. I wonder what the purpose of the book is, is it to enlighten people and set them on a selfless course of spiritual development, or to fulfill people's desires? In my opinion such a focus on desire, greed, etc, does not very well mix with spiritual development, since these qualities tend to block us from seeing our true inner Selves. Of course if one gets enlightened, there is no more suffering and in a sense this is infinite wealth, but desire and wealth in itself should not be the main reason to buy your book.
<br>
<br>
I dont wish to be a nuisance, these are just my honest ideas on your information page.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for your attention.
<br>
<br>
-Xetrov.

<section>
Hello Xetrov
<br>
<br>
I agree that the page may seem like a paradox, but believe me it was extremely carefully thought out over several months.
<br>
<br>
The overall fact is that if people are to benefit from the book they have to read it. And I can say that I have a very large number of emails from people who have the book saying how it has changed their life and many other profoundly positive things.
<br>
<br>
It is true that we must evolve beyond the desire for material things but at the same time we need material things to survive in a material world. If people desire great wealth then that is all a part of the process. Everyone has to evolve by their own actions and in particular thoughts.
<br>
<br>
It is true that my book teaches how to attract anything at all, but it also teaches the significance of these things. In other words it is completely balanced.
<br>
<br>
I realise the deadline thing could be improved upon, but experience has taught me that however you write it people never take it seriously and take action until it is too late, and then expect one to retrospectively extend the offer again. This method adds a sense of urgency to take action.
<br>
<br>
And again, this is not just a sales ploy, the price will soon be increased and the existing bonuses removed as of midnight one day.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Some constructive criticism, I'm sure no one will take it personally.
<br>
<br>
First off, couldn't someone have proof-read it?  there are so many typos it looks like it was thrown together very quickly.
<br>
<br>
"Looks more like an encyclopedia than a book since there are so many chapters!"
<br>
<br>
Indeed, there is an average of 6 pages per chapter, ditto above, and the motto 'quality not quantity' springs to mind.
<br>
<br>
"Given the quality (and nature) of the book, Adrian would have most certainly forgotten to remove the script and I'm sure that he will fix it as soon he read about your remark. "
<br>
<br>
Why was it there in the first place?  It looks like a website trying to promote p***s enlargers ('how do you know?'...yeah yeah
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
)
<br>
<br>
 "I realise the deadline thing could be improved upon, but experience has taught me that however you write it people never take it seriously and take action until it is too late, and then expect one to retrospectively extend the offer again. This method adds a sense of urgency to take action. "
 <br>
 <br>
 In other words an attempt to scare people into spending their money and snatching a 'bargain'!
 <img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 I have a very large number of emails from people saying how impossibly good looking I am
 <br>
 <br>
 I hope no one takes offence to my comments, I might have been a bit blunt but surely that will make you ask yourself if I'm right, and promote change (like editing the typos).  So please take this in the light hearted manner it was intended.

Hello zebrano,
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for your comments which I realise are well intended.
<br>
<br>
I have to say in absolute honesty however that very few people indeed have echo'd your sentiments. I do accept the fact there are a few remaining small typo's, but let me assure you that you cannot "throw together" a 676 page, 210K word book on these subjects; if you think you can then I respectfully suggest that you try it sometime
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Our Ultimate Reality is the result of 2 years of work including the writing and editing processes.
<br>
<br>
Before publication the book was proof-read and copy edited by several people and many corrections were made as a direct result. I am sure you will appreciate that as the author who has read the book through so many times it is easy to overlook things that other people might notice.
<br>
<br>
As it is there are very few typo's, and they are corrected as they are found. I have seen more typos's in books published in hard copy from large publishing houses.
<br>
<br>
There are 676 pages because that is how many it took to get across the entire scope of the subject matter in a coherent way; it could easily have been 1000+ pages.  As far as the quality goes the numerous unsolicited testimonials I receive all the time speaks for themself; the book is changing the lives of many people and I am very grateful for that.
<br>
<br>
I do realise of course that everyone's experience is different, and I thank you for your comments which again I know are well intended.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Adrian, you should seriously think about publishing this book. So it's available to people in the shops. It's over 600 pages trying to print all that out into a book version is a nightmare. This book is awesome and contains everything we need to know. I have read many books and this is one of the best. I would love a hard copy that i can take around with me. There's so much chaff out there in the book shops. This book would change the world if it was given to every human being that's how good it is. The secrets of the universe revealed.

  Adrian, the book is fantastic as far as I can tell.  I am receiving the 7 free chapters, but I would like to comment on this question and let you correct me if I seem to be leading in a wrong direction.
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 This is from experience and I am not using this book to explain my view.  In my opinion, spirit is energy.  Our bodies take this energy and concentrate it in a vessel containing the neural pathways to transform this energy into movement and thought.
 <br>
 <br>
 I do have a disagreement with your concept of 'time' being an illusion.  If you agree that God, the Source, created all of the spheres and somebody goes as far as quoting the bible, the sphere called the sun was created for just that purpose.  Not only was the sun to give light, but mark time; i.e. signs, seasons, days, and years.  However, the word 'time' could be considered an illusion when it is reduced to a device, such as a watch or clock.  'Time' is based on the hexadecimal system started by the first civilization of man in the east; 60 second minute, 60 minute hour, 24 hour day, 7 day week, 30 day month, etc.  But, the disagreement is fading fast.  I seem to be convincing myself, here.  It is the 'human concept' of time that is an illusion.
 <br>
 <br>
 The vibrations of God at a certain frequency is foremost in my mind.  When I was driving through town the other day, I just had a conversation with a friend about frequency vibrations and tuning forks.  We discussed that you could listen to a tuning fork long enough to 'hear' the vibrations in everything from refridgerator motors to just about everything.  I talked about the makeup of the 'hearing' apparatus of the ear.  I liken that to a harmonica and the sound waves being the 'breath.'
 <br>
 <br>
 As I was driving in traffic, I noticed the different levels of sound from the low hum to the horn blowing to the screeching of tires to the roaring of engines; no silence.  My mind started thinking 'That's chaos.'  I got out of that chaos and got into a calmer atmosphere like sitting in front of my computer next to an open window listening to the call of nature and being entertained by Adrian's book.
 <br>
 <br>
 Thank's Adrian for taking the time to bring out the thoughts in that book.

I think what is clever about that is he is not telling you what to do to get it.  He leaves it up to you to get it.  'You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.'

 Hello Alex,

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Thank you very much indeed for your interest in the book.
 <br>
 <br>
 Thebook is only available in eBook format at this time. The type quality on screen is however very high, in fact I spent quite some time in ensuring this.
 <br>
 <br>
 eBook format also has many other advantages such as the abilty to add comments, highlights, bookmarks etc., and I will be offering all future updates to existing customers for free; something that cannot be done in hard copy format.
 <br>
 <br>
 Best regards,

<br>
Hi ya Adrian...
<br>
I bought your Ulimate Reality book myself.  My wife and I have read it and will re-read it from time to time.
<br>
<br>
I printed out though.  I read it in both forms but to have a printed out 'copy' is great.  I cheated a bit and used the wonderful Dell CN5100 Full Duplex printer at
<i>
 work
</i>
.
<br>
Full Duplex for those that do not know what that means is....it prints on both sides of the paper.  So a 600+ page book becomes a 300+ page book.  I then used an very old fashion 3 point punch and then put the book in a 3 ring binder.  A very LARGE 3 ring binder.  HeHe!  It needed that.  It is a pretty big book to read in that form but still I like to sit and read paper over a screen at times.
<br>
<br>
Great book to read.  So when you do decide on actually having this printed in a
<i>
 smaller soft cover form
</i>
then will we the original purchasers receive some kind of a price break on it? When I say smaller soft cover form I mean something still small enough to hold with one hand while reading in bed or laying on the beach so my other hand can find a beverage/food.  hehe! Those to me are the best books to read.  (I am not speaking of the fairly small paper back books we normally see.)   The soft cover would be perfect for this book.
<br>
<br>
Also I must thank you for the larger font you used in this book. Not that I have to have a larger font but, it does make it easier to simply read and concentrate with the larger font.
<br>
<br>
EDIT: I forgot to ask...Since we have actually purchased this book will we recieve 'updates' to add to it from time to time?

I give this book a five-star rating so far, though I'm only about one third into it, (I am too excited to wait until I'm done to thank you!) I'll tell you what happened, I purchased this e-book about 2 years ago, and didn't realize it was an e-book when I purchased it, and was furious at myself at the time for not realizing that, so I printed the whole thing and kept it at work in a file, until just recently,  my precious dog and best friend of 14 years died. You had a chapter about "animals after passing" I read for comfort and it helped me so much, you can't believe--Thank you Adrian!! So I've just started from the beginning, and can't put it down! Every chapter gives all of the important information on the subject in a "nutshell", and I planned on using it for a reference book, as I will, but I definetly plan on reading it at least twice! This book is definetly worth the small investment!!
<br>

Thank you again!

I bought the book a few months ago from amazon and appreciated reading it. I like how it points out that there is a difference between astral projection and out of body experiences, and also differences between the etheric body and astral body etc. There is very informative info in there which I have to reread because I readt it fast the first time and then set it aside so I could digest it.

tvos is 100% correct!
<br>
<br>
I rarely 'see' advertisments for anything here myself.
<br>
<br>
There is a LOT of info on this site that has nothing to do with any of the material that can be purchased.
<br>
<br>
I get the 'News Letters' in my email and I can opt out of them if I desire.
<br>
<br>
I believe there is a pretty good balance here.  No one is forcing anyone to buy anything.
<br>
<br>
Also a BIG plus here is the fact there are no hyper-links ads within the posts.  Those annoy me greatly.
<br>
So, I believe Adrian has been more then fair with giving away a lot of his work right within this forum.
<br>
<br>
Go check out other websites with similar subject matter and see the difference.  Some even ban you right away for even 'questioning' anything they do.
<br>
Not here.

 <br>
 Hello everyone,
 <br>
 <br>
 I have launched the book and site for
 <b>
  Our Ultimate Reality, Life, the Universe and the Destiny of Mankind today
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 I will repeat the URL again later in this message, but here is
 <br>
 the URL:
 <br>
 <br>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.ourultimatereality.com
 </a>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  Our Ultimate Reality
 </b>
 is the culmination of over 2 years writing
 <br>
 based on my own seeking, experiences and knowledge over the course
 <br>
 of 40 years. During that time I have been priveledged to have
 <br>
 learned a tremendous amount from many diverse sources. Our Ultimate
 <br>
 Reality now brings the benefit of those 40+ years to its readers
 <br>
 over the course of 684 pages and 144 chapters.
 <br>
 <br>
 Although the book flows seamlessly from beginning to end it is also
 <br>
 a reference work for many valuable abilitities such as Astral
 <br>
 Projection, OBE, Healing, Concentration, Attracting Wealth and
 <br>
 much, much more. I have included a fill list of chapters at the end
 <br>
 of this newsletter.
 <br>
 <br>
 By buying Our Ultimate Reality you will immediately benefit from
 <br>
 what I have personally learned, practiced and achieved over the
 <br>
 last 40 years, much of which you can out into practice immediately
 <br>
 to achieve results in the next 40 days!
 <br>
 <br>
 Of particular interest, based on the many emails I receive on this
 <br>
 subject, will be my best 3 methods for achieving Astral projection
 <br>
 and OBE. While success cannot be guaranteed, being subject to so
 <br>
 many different variables, not the least of which is personal
 <br>
 commitment, I can say that in my opinion these methods provide the
 <br>
 very best chance so far of achieving Astral projection and OBE.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am also offering for a time three valuable additional bonuses:
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  Abyss:
 </b>
 This is a binaural brainwave synchronisation MP3 for use
 <br>
 with meditation, Astral Projection, OBE, Healing, Manifestaion and
 <br>
 many other things. Abyss first appeared in its original form over 2
 <br>
 years ago, but since then has evolved considerably into a state of
 <br>
 the art binaural brainwave entrainment MP3 that has been developed
 <br>
 not only based on the feedback of many people, but also based on
 <br>
 the detailed analysis of many other well known, and expensive
 <br>
 binaural products out here. Abyss incorporates the best of them all!
 <br>
 Abyss can be used for a range of purposes, including but not
 <br>
 limited to meditation, wealth, health, Astral projection, OBE and
 <br>
 much more. Abyss perfectly compliments the main book.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  The Power of Concentration:
 </b>
 The ability to concentrate effectively
 <br>
 is an absolutely crucial prerequisite to achieving anything at all
 <br>
 of real, long-term value. The truth of this most important fact of
 <br>
 this cannot be underestimated.This exceptional book, The Power of
 <br>
 Concentration, was originally written by Theron Dumont in 1918, but
 <br>
 the information and teachings therein are as valid today as ever.
 <br>
 This is what the author himself says about concentration: "Success
 <br>
 is assured when you are able to concentrate, for you are then able
 <br>
 to utilize for your good all constructive thoughts and shut out all
 <br>
 the destructive ones. It is of the greatest value to be able to
 <br>
 think only that which will be beneficial."
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  A Guide to Psychic Defense:
 </b>
 It is a shocking yet true fact that we
 <br>
 are all constantly subject to psychic attacks by many different
 <br>
 different types and levels from inner and psychic beings and
 <br>
 forces.  These attacks range from unintentional attacks by people
 <br>
 with forceful personalities such as some sales people, friends,
 <br>
 relatives and partners, through full demonic possession. This is a
 <br>
 more serious issue than people realize! In A Guide to Psychic
 <br>
 Defense you will learn everything you need to know about all forms
 <br>
 of psychic attack, how to prevent it, and what you can do if you
 <br>
 have been attacked.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am truly humbled and honoured by the amazing feedback I have
 <br>
 received from those people who have read Our Ultimate Reality, and
 <br>
 can only hope that everyone finds the book of equal value.
 <br>
 <br>
 In addition to the book, I am delighted to launch a brand new
 <br>
 forums resource dedicated to the subjects covered in the book.
 <br>
 These forums will be very focussed and highly moderated from the
 <br>
 outset by some of the moderators you are already familiar with and
 <br>
 who do such exceptional work at the Astral Pulse. Quality is the
 <br>
 emphasis from the outset, and all membership applications will be
 <br>
 approved by myself. I hope to see many of you there!
 <br>
 <br>
 As always I really appreciate all suggestions that in any way
 <br>
 improve the quality of the forums for the benefit of everyone.
 <br>
 <br>
 I also very much appreciate comments on the newsletter and in
 <br>
 particular what you would like to see included in the future.
 <br>
 <br>
 Once again The URL of the new site is:
 <br>
 <br>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.ourultimatereality.com
 </a>
 <br>
 <br>
 And thank you once again for your wonderful support, and I hope to
 <br>
 see you at the new forums as well as here as ever!
 <br>
 <br>
 Best regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian.
