A few nights ago I was lucid dreaming and in this dream there was much fighting among me and people.  A moment later the dream reshaped and I came to the realization a war was going on.  I asked this man holding this mega huge gun why all the war and how can this war could be stopped.  He replied something like...  Everyone is holding on so tight to this materialistic world.  I then understood that the only way to stop the war was for this world/planet to cease to exist.  After this, somewhere in my subconsious, I agreed to carry on with this solution.  The entire world Shifted into billions of 'pieces.'  As the world shifted out of existence It seeemed that it actually never did exist--I could actually feel it as the beginning and end of time simultaneously.  I then recieved this extremely intense and high-pitched ringing through my ears.  The instant I realized this had all happened I also realized that I was billions of miles away from anyone or anything.  Perhaps that everyone was equally spread throughout the vast universe.  Extreme loneliness set in and I didn't like it.  Soon I thought, if I keep this up any longer it might be permanent.  So I pulled back from the agreement and back to this world. Then I woke..totally freaked.  If anyone has heard anything like this or experienced something quite like it, plz respond, I am quite intrigued by it.  Perhaps this feeling was universal harmony?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
From what you say it's a fairly typical highly lucid dream experience that took place within Focus 2 of consciousness. What you are viewing objectively is not an actual circumstance as such, but is an objective translation of the underlying subjective events.
<br>
<br>
Many people have dreams about war, or other such upsets. This is representative of the underlying conflicts caused when we create aspects of ourselves that could be said to be in opposition with each other. This is typically objectively manifest when a person is caught in a circumstance where one aspect of them is saying to take one route in life, and another aspect is saying to take another, and they would appear to be in opposing (or near opposing) directions. So we find it safer to tackle these issues within what we call the dream state.
<br>
<br>
In this state we experiment and indulge in all manner of scenarios. It's a state where we can do basically whatever we like and "get away with it" as it were. So we often use it as a kind of release for all manner of things depending on the character of the person in question. This is how people have come to figure out that their dreams might actually mean something. They do, but in my view people take it too far when they publish books that claim if you dream about, say, water, then that means X, or if you dream about the colour red, then that means Y. Because in reality there is no such universal translation that can be applied. Dreams are a highly subjective experience and, as such, are as individual as fingerprints.
<br>
<br>
In the dream state, we allow ourselves an awareness of the subjective and the objective (in terms of states) and we let them flow freely and intertwine in harmony. In this state we allow ourselves an interaction that we would not normally engage within Focus 1, the physical. And it is an interaction that is free of all linear-time constraints. We can experiment and indulge in all manner of creative options, for example, an artist may create a piece of work in Focus 2, take a look at it, make all manner of adjustments and changes, and then bring that work into objective reality.
<br>
<br>
In interacting with the subjective aspects of ourselves, we often create a series of objective images in order to produce a reference framework for our understanding. So while this imagery is presented to us as a reality, it is also symbolism at the same time. Plus, it is a very unique symbolism that is presented in a language that only the individual can understand, and maybe one or two other individuals, relatively speaking, who are
<i>
 genuinely
</i>
psychic and have the ability to translate a person's inner-sense activity from the imagery in question.
<br>
<br>
This is why many of us have experienced a situation where we remember a dream, or some element of it, and then at some stage in waking life, could be an hour later or even a month or two, some physical situation will come about and the instance it does we will remember the element of a particular dream.

I use to be good at interpreting dream from my friends and family because i know them well. My own dream are sometimes hard but the vast majority of my dreams i don't have memories of or very scattered memories. I can remember s strange dream i had
<br>
I was flying in my town at a park sorta very open one.. There where this apple tree and this angel was floating by it and picking apples. I asked her who she/he was or something similar and she replied: "I am God" or sorta like that.. And I what she was or what kind of being she was.. And she replied: "Volier" And that word i can swear i had never heard before.
<br>
Later i found out that it means Flying and that it can be a sorta cage for birds..
<br>
<br>
Anyway i gotta hurry now

Thanks Frank for you response.  What you are saying does relate quite well to my current situation.  I am currently in process of a huge career change and totally different lifestyle that I believe is right but extemely hesitant.
<br>
I understand what you are saying by subjective interpretation.  Lately I have been blown away by the instant progress of my intuition and need to get a sort of system at understanding the symbolism.  It all hits me so fast and unexpected though.  But I think you are saying, if I interpret something like 'red' for love or war, I should interpret red the same everytime from then on.
<br>
I usually don't mention dreams for this reason, but this one was so unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Complete peace -I guess could describe it.
<br>
Anyways, thanks again
