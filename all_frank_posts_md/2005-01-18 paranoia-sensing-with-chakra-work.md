<section>
I'm finding now that I "sense" too much when I do full chakra work in the evening. I become paranoid and "feel" things, unpleasantish tingles and a sense that maybe there is things/people around me like spirits.
<br>
<br>
In other posts I've complained somewhat that I am psychically blind etc no matter what I've tried so far. Now I find I'm still pretty blindish-I don't get super dreams and experiences etc, in fact I can only do the energy work but I do feel the chakras strongly when I work on them. Last session however I found I was getting almost imposed random images that started to bug me, and I had to quit the session. Normally I'm fairly practical, as in I grab something and do it. I don't go in for anything "ethereal" because it's not real to me, but this is a new sensation.
<br>
Am I creating these sensations or is this something real? If it is, is the road to becoming psychically aware one fraught with paranoid type experiences etc before getting to the "cool" stuff? If so whilst alone I don't think I can be doing it! (It's different when my partner is here however!)

Maybe I put this in the room section! LOL. I asked a question a while ago about Xenoglossalia also, but presumably nobody has experience with this?
<br>
<br>
Would anyone care to comment?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Personally, I can't see what the problem is. You are choosing to take action in order to broaden your awareness and have the wider reality come into your objective awareness. From what you say, you are being successful in that. But as you are doing so, it appears from what you say that a part of you is rejecting it for some reason. Having visions, bodily sensations, feelings of other "people" around you. That's all fairly normal.
<br>
<br>
Everything within your reality is real. I suppose the question arises with most people is how much reality can a person take before they start having problems in their normal functioning?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

It's been so slow to have anything develop and happen that I really don't want stupid fears and barriers stopping me again to be honest
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
. That's annoying, to find I was completely closed apart from being able to move energy to finding that something idiotic as this stops me from practising when alone. At the moment 4 nights a week I'm alone so this is a problem.
<br>
I'd rather the shadow self, the stupid depressive side of me that derails motivation etc would just quit for a change rather than keep returning to stop things.
<br>
Sorry ranting
