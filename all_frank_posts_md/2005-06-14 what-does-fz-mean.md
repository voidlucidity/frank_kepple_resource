Hi:
<br>
<br>
It's the 3D-Blackness at the Monroe Focus 21 state. We call it Fz after all interested parties here took a vote on it. Writing out "3D-Blackness" every time was becoming a little tiresome, lol.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 is a particular focus of mental attention that is characterised by the objective action of "stepping into" or becoming surrounded by a 3 dimensional blackness that can often be punctuated by a kind of starscape effect.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
