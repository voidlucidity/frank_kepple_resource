After a half dozen projections into darkness and another 6 or so into the dimly lit woods behind my house I found the astral! I headed out into the yard, saw the moon in the distance, ended up going towards it(after those dark places I seem to head for brighter zones automatically), was in some sort of plaza beneath the moon and looked up in the sky and there were these shapes in the sky-kind of like lit up boxes and geometric forms, somehow I chose one, found myself moving in this space that was full of rainbow colors, floating geometric forms, and music, just kind of floated in it a while, then went into another room where I was going to eat bread, looked at the menu on the wall-food is expensive there, a portobella mushroom sandwich was $12, then i slowly faded back to bed.
<br>
I suppose the shapes in the sky were entry portals, I guess if I could tune into them again I would be able to phase into the astral like the discussion going on here.

Great adventure!  Sounds like a big leap forward in your OBE's.  Did you have any physical symptoms, energy vibrations etc?

<br>
So?
<br>
After a while you will realise that there is no difference - dreams, Lucid dreams, the astral, they are all one.
<br>
<br>
People shouldnt disregard 'lucid dreams'  as not being an astral experience.
<br>
Everytime you dream, you are having an astral experience.
<br>
<br>
Eventially you realise that the difference between all such states is concious awareness, THAT is what makes the difference!

Good responses all, it does seem like the difference between projections and lucid dreams is the vibratiions and waking before the dream, and carryiung a thread of awareness into the dream-which may be only a function of our awareness capability. For the last few nights I have awakened in the middle of the night, done some energy work and tryed to project, felt some vibrations, gone back to sleep, then every other night have projected twice(tonight is the night also). The projection I wrote about was the second of the night, with the first ending when I saw the moon, and wanted to go to it(what about thought and intent everyone?), and found myself zooming away. The second one began with buzzing and feeling half in and out of my body, pulling myself out by grabbing the window -about 2 feet from my bed- and yanking, seeing the pattern of squares in the window screen -maybe a precurser to the geometrics to come. When leaving I also had the thought that I surely woke my wife with all the struggle to to get out-I can see why we experience paralysis when we sleep.

Well said that man.
<br>
<br>
The Lucid Dream state is, basically, Monroe's Focus 22. With one MAJOR difference, which is, your level of conscious awareness. Also, perhaps I should mention, there is all manner of activity going on within the Astral realms. In other words, you can sit in a cafe or bar just like you can on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Of course, it is only natural for a person to think, when they first start to come across these places, that they must be dreaming and it is not a true Astral experience. I know I did. But, as I say, all manner of human activity that you see on the Physical, also occurs on the Astral.
<br>
