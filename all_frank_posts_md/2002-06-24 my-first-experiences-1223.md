<section>
I'm glad to have found this forum !  I'll try to be clear, I'm from Quebec and I usually speak french.
<br>
<br>
I would like to know what are the sensations you feel when you seem to have an Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
I 've had the same experiences for 4 years when I sleep in afternoon.  When it's happenning, I hear a very loud sound, like vibrations, I can almost feel them.  And then I can't move my "physic body" anymore...  Very often, I panic and I try to "wake up".
<br>
<br>
Since a year, I try to control my fears about this and I want to progress.  I have a diary to write all my experiences about astral or lucid dreams, because I want to study this phenomena.  I had some interesting experiences, but they are very basic.  I don't control my OBE experiences.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for my bad english, I hope you'll understand what I wrote

Hello Clarine
<br>
<br>
Greetings from bellow, i aint too far from you. I'm typing this from my place in New Brunswick. My english is probably just as bad as yours.(I'm frensh too). Anyways... I'd like to welcome you to astral pulse...You'll learn that  this is a very useful place to discuse things like OOBE's...
<br>
<br>
I've had just about the same experiences as you. I've had a few lucid dreams and one or two OOBE. So...I probably cant help you much, but there are certainly people here who could! everybody here tends to help each other...so i welcome you again and wish you good luck.
<br>
<br>
Paul

What you describe are the preliminary stages of Astral Projection. Certainly nothing to be fearful about though your reactions are understandable. Lots of people think they are dying and stuff like that. Which can obviously be very scary.
<br>
<br>
The thing to do is to put aside the fear and let events take their natural course. You have lots of wonderful surprises in store.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi Paul from New Brunswick !  Nice to meet you ;o)
<br>
<br>
Frank :
<br>
When I had these feelings for the first time (about 4 years ago), I did'nt think I was dying, I firstly thought that I was going to have an OBE...  I read few books before this experience and I knew that it was an OBE.
<br>
<br>
Now, for this summer, I decided to learn more about this, because I want to have succesful experiences, without FEARS
