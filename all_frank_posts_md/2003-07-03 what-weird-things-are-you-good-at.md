Fols, we're all good at something weird.  If you think long enough, you'll remember something.  Some people can pick things up with their toes or touch their ears with their toungues.  Other people can speak Klingon - - and do.
<br>
<br>
I knew someone who could recite the entire script of the original Star Wars.  Then again, I also knew two people who could sing the entire Bugs Bunny Opera (kill the wabbit, kill the wabbit!).
<br>
<br>
So, what's YOUR thing?  It can't be metaphysical, it has to be something just weird.  I'm still thinking about mine.

I can't touch my ear with my tongue but can touch my nose..ewwwwww..I use to be able to fold my eyelids inside out..but haven't tried that in a LONG time, just never came up..lol.

I can pick up things with my toes too!  I also can move my head side-to-side like a serpent, along with other near-impossible body contortions that come from being a dancer. Nevermind what I used to be able to do with these "cans" - - - - um, wait - - - yup - - - I can still do it - - - wow.  Something to show my grandchildren someday! HAH

I used to be able to speak Dakota, an obscure native american language. I spent some time in college translating creation stories (transcribed phonetically) into english. But that was a long time ago.

<section>
Nay,
<br>
yes I know what you mean about the high pitched noises from TV's etc. In TV's this is due to one of the main components that provides the high voltage for the screen. It runs at a high frequency, and sometimes people can hear the noise it makes, especially if that component starts to become faulty. For those of us with sensitive hearing it gets downright irritating and your ears start to hurt.
<br>
<br>
I also know what you mean also be "feeling" it more than hearing it. I think it could be a sensitivity to EM emissions from all the electrical appliances around us.
<br>
<br>
James.

<section>
I am almosta "Block head" if you are familiar with the tirm.  The pounding of nails into the nose, straight back into the head.  I prefer to use smooth painted chops sticks though, mails can be a bit rough.  And I only do it when I am bored.
<br>
<br>
I use me feet to do a lot of stuff.  Pick things up, open doors when my hands are full, grab stuff that is just out of reach, pet the dogs, and so on.
<br>
<br>
I'm double jointed!  So I can slip out of a "full nelson" (wrestling move), and I can also fold may arm flate accross my back, ie, back against wall with both arms sticking straight out on side.
<br>
<br>
I can cross one eye and look at you with the other, and then switch it back and forth.  This tends to be very distracting in conversation.
<br>
<br>
I also tend to flare my nostrals, like a rabbit does.  Also distracting.
<br>
<br>
I like to walk around with my eyes closed.   I can kinda still see where everything is at.  I do really good in pitch black areas.  I think it comes from having really bad eyesight.  Its dangerous for me to walk around with out my glasses so I just shut my eyes.  It's actually easier that way.
<br>
<br>
I got the "super hearing" thing also.  I can also track 3 or 4 different conversations at once, and participate in them.
<br>
<br>
I can only lick the bottom of my nose, I can't get my tounge to go up to the tip.  But I got a big nose too, of which I can fit quarters into......not that I do that or anything.....right well moving along.
<br>
<br>
Ialso tend to go around quoting Monty Python, mostly Search For The Holy Grail.  Then there are the other movie classics, Strange Brew, Space Balls, Blazing Saddles to name a few.
<br>
<br>
I am sure the list is longer than this but most of this stuff seems perfectly normal to me.
<br>
<br>
Ofcourse a lot of people think my dreams are a little strange too.  Like the other day I had a dream where I was waling around outside in my underware.  But it was okay because I remember thinking to myself, "Uh Dave, your dreaming about being outside in your underware....Let's go back inside and go back to bed." and a few days before that I had one about shaving my legs.
<br>
<br>
Okay I'm done.
<br>
For now.
<br>

This thread is cracking me up! I love the photo, Lasher! Can we have a sound file, too? Hee!
<br>
<br>
I sound like a Monty Python "lady" when I scream. Does that count as a talent? And I'm really good at imitating accents. I can improvise devastatingly bizarre tone poems on the piano. Also, I can write impressive-sounding poetry that's utterly devoid of meaning.
<br>
<br>
I can fall asleep at will (and I'm really asleep when I do it--I've tested myself with EEG equipment!)
<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm able to turn off nasty odors or make them smell good to me (a side effect of cleaning up animal excretions for a living for some years.)
<br>
<br>
Aren't we all so interesting...

) And I feel quite comfortable in saying that he won't have to worry abount competition from me any time soon.  Firstly, he's in much better shape.  Secondly, he's got an entire guitar to cover his privates with, while I only have a ukulele.

I can control air flow between my nose and inner ear. Its like a have a muscle that nobody else does. It is actually very useful when I go scuba diving as I just drop all the air out of my suit and sink like a rock with my hands behind my back looking waaaay cool [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]. And if I push more air in/take more air out (ie vary the pressure in my inner ear) I hear different frequencies of sound. Like, low pressure gives me the low notes and vice versa.
<br>
At least I know that if someone tried to gag me I could blow me ear drums and breath through my bleeding ears! Ouch...

-I can say some words extrememly fast such as "nope" or "bye".
<br>
-I can walk really fast.
<br>
-Sometimes I can whistle with a range as big as 3 octaves.
<br>
-At night when I'm alone I can creep myself out or scare myself with my imagination.  Sometimes I just start visualizing creepy creatures and have to clear my mind so I don't scare myself too bad.

Yes, I know. The mind is a terrible thing to waste. And it's not a painful as one might think, unless you do it wrong.  The only thing you really need to remember is not to sneeze, at least not with said object in your nose.  Now that hurts.

You specified 2 hands, are there more that we should be made aware of?

Hey speedcubist,
<br>
<br>
Your vibrating eyes caught my attention.  Everything looks blurry and shakes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the club!  This is called Saccadic Nystagmus.  They say 1 in 500 people can do this voluntarily.  Unfortunately, for some it happens when they do not want it to.
<br>
<br>
I am in the voluntary group and find the more light there is the faster I can make my eyes giggle.  It served me well in my life.  If a guy was bothering me (say at a bar), all I had to do was look at one of the lights, look back at him and totally freak him out.  The ability to look possessed is wonderful don't you think[

All the Best,

Wow, cool!  I had no idea so few people could voluntarily vibrate their eyes(1 in 500). [

1. i can fold my tongue into thirds in the front of my mouth so that my tongue looks like a mouth within a mouth.
<br>
2. i can predict who's on the phone when it rings. mental caller ID! woohoo!
<br>
3. i can create a sopund in my throat that sounds something between a roar and an anguished scream.
<br>
4. i know huge words. (you're pressing upon my neural transmitters in a deleterious manner which doesn't make me very eudaemonistic.)
<br>
5. i pick up random facts. see my autograph for details.
<br>
6. i know many random jokes and bumper sticker sayings (one day we'll look back on this, laugh nervously, then change the subject).
<br>
7. i can sound exactly like the lady singing opera on the beginning of the Encarta program (now, if only i had some bongo drums...).
<br>
8. while creepy, i can think of many creative ways to maim and kill people. or is that the neg? hehe.
<br>
9. i can laugh evilly.
<br>
10. i can create a different personality for every person's likes and dislikes. for instance, if i meet a goth, i act goth, even though I'm rather ditzy. sorta.
<br>
<br>
that's all i can think of for now...

I can whistle with my tounge, but thats not the joy of it, i can make an extremely high pitched whistle with only my mouth that people usualy end up covering their ears over. I can also give people my middle toe with out having to use my hand to help it, the foot can give the toe all by itself, so when i give someone the finger, they give me 2, all i gotta do is take off my shoe and show em the 3.

My husband can do the vibrating eye thing..very creepy..he is way more talented than I am. For example he can make a sound like Chewbacca which is so very annoying *L* The only thing I can think of that I do is the Yoda "hmmmmmm?"[

It has happened that I knew when some people would die by either having this intuition or vivid dreams ...
<br>
<br>
premonitory dreams are still coming now and then about events in the news or in the family...
<br>
<br>
I cannot tell the future, but I can tell some events that will happen in the future...
<br>
<br>
I usually have very weird dreams, with corpses, blood, or people with 4 eyes, etc... and some a premonitory signs....of death.
<br>
<br>
Take care.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for being so serious.

this is so funny. I suddenly got hit with a big panick after reading this thread thinking oh no I cant do any of that but after thinking about it for a while I do have some
<br>
<br>
I can learn a language in just under 3 weeks I forget it when I leave the contry and can only maintain a proficiency in 7 simultaneusly
<br>
<br>
I can say "CALIFORNIA" like with a perfect Arnold Swartzneger accent.
<br>
<br>
I am a very proficient Ventrilouguist but maybe that does not count as it is my job but it is kind of wierd. (got a few others for the vierd job section)
<br>
<br>
I can see if my wife is fibbing.
<br>
<br>
I can look at people and make them uneasy. (not so proud of that but its handy at times)
<br>
<br>
and last of all I can sing in falcetto. Pretty good for a man my age I should think

ooh mustardseed you reminded me.  I'm real good at picking up languages and other symbolic systems.  Never had an opportunity to learn more than 3 1/2 languages though - spanish, french, dakota, and a little greek.
<br>
<br>
I can effortlessly copy a foreign accent - french with a spanish accent, english with a spanish-celtic accent, english with a southern accent, boston accent, parisian accent, etc. But I can't keep it up unless I do it constantly.

  Ok so in the last one I told you I have this odd arm spasm dealy...  Well I've upped that to maybe 16 times per second. If you want an estimate on what it sounds like when I use a pen on a hard surface, imagine a woodpecker.  I might even be faster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also I still have 2 eye abilities
  <img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
  <br>
  <br>
  1.  I can also vibrate my eyes back and forth and kill my vision temporarily :p  It's alot of fun though.
  <br>
  <br>
  2.  I can exhale air out of my eye.  There's a small air pocket leading from my nose to the side of my eye that I can exhale air out of.  You can see bubbles come out of it underwater.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's uber coolness.
