<section>
Hi all, this is my first post, though I've been lurking for a while.
<br>
<br>
I am so fascinated with phasing, and so glad to learn of a new, leading-edge concept and method of astral projection.  The more "traditional" OBE stuff was leaving me frustrated.  Then I just happened to find this site!  It's as I always say, there are no "coincidences"!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I have experienced AP, especially since my fiance's recent death; my primary driving force is that I hope to remain connected with him!  I have had some very intense experiences, usually involving him coming to me while I'm lying down at night, talking to me, holding me, looking very radiant.  I've also seen my deceased grandmother, and a child who I believe was to have been our son, but instead he's going to be one of my "guides."
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I also had a very strange experience one night.  A lady was standing at my bed (I am always aware of being in my bed in my apartment whenever I have these experiences).  I didn't know the lady, but she seemed benevolent.  She asked me if I'd like to come to where she was.  I said "OK, what the hell?"  She took my hand, and suddenly, my apartment seemed to stretch out and then disappear.
<br>
<br>
I was still lying on my bed, flat on my back, but suddenly some blue lights, then stars, then entire galaxies began to rush around me very fast.  It was as if my bed and I were traveling very quickly downward--but without any real sensation of motion!  I was very afraid, but I told myself to just stay still and watch.  Then I saw a strange image, it was a galaxy, but it had grid lines, arrows, and written notes, almost like it was some kind of blueprint for a galaxy.  That image stayed still in front of me for a few seconds.  Then I was back in my room immediately!
<br>
<br>
The lady was still there, and she said, "You see, either you can travel through the universe, or the universe can travel around you.  It's quite simple, really."  I was like, "Wow, that's cool.  But all I really want is to see [my fiance]."  And no sooner had I thought or said that, then he appeared!  I got up and gave him a big hug.  Then, everything ended (though I don't recall waking up).  Whenever he shows up, I get so excited, I can't stay with him for long!
<br>
<br>
Anyway.... My experiences were much more than dreams, I know that much.  A friend told me they were OBEs.  But they didn't fit with what I had read about OBEs---I never experienced vibrations, or any real motion.  I always just felt like I was still in the physical, still lying in my bed, just like normal.  Your phasing experiences sounded a lot more similar to what I had experienced.
<br>
<br>
Do you think I was phasing?  Or were they lucid dreams?  Or--?  I can say that I have always been very mindful of seeing things when I close my eyes...colors, moving shapes, grey fog, stars.  I've always enjoyed that, ever since I can remember!  I used to ask my mom what the colors and shapes and things were.  She told me, "It's sleep."  I've always really enjoyed going to sleep--which is probably why she said that!
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
And then,  sometimes even when I'm awake and looking at something physical, I can "see through" the physical and see strange shapes and motions or patterns.  So, I am hoping that phasing will come somewhat "naturally" to me!  I am certainly going to explore it further!
<br>
<br>
I can't wait to check out F3!!!

Thanks, and I'll "see you around"!

Hello,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forums.  Those shapes and patterns you speak of are some what familiar to me as well... I'm *not* sure I understand what they are myself.  sorry somethimes I think what I'm going to write and forget words in the process that end up making it completely different

I've always been really curious, but at the same time, I got the sense that they're just a normal occurrences.  I often asked my parents when I was a kid--why do I see this funny moving pattern in the sky?  Why do I see these gorgeous moving colors when I close my eyes?  Why do I see funny shapes moving around?
<br>
<br>
Looking back, I don't think my parents knew what the heck I was talking about.  They would tell me I was just imagining things. Either that, or they would give me some vaguely physiological explanation, like, "It's just the chemicals in your eyes adjusting to the light/dark" or "It's probably just a speck of dust floating across your eye."
<br>
<br>
And maybe there is some boring physiological explanation, but I really wonder now...maybe they're glimpses of the invisible universe!  I keep thinking about
<i>
 Star Trek
</i>
--how sometimes the Holodeck would go on the fritz and you could see part of the "grid" behind the images.  Maybe that happens here in the physical world too?

I guess they are normal... I'm not sure how many people see them... I haven't really asked.  One of my friends said they were Auras... but I'm not really sure it that is what they are... I'm just as curious to find out what they are as you are.

Your posts are wonderful because they typify the ease at which we can Phase in and out of the wider reality. The funny shapes, the moving colours, yep, I know those. That's the Monroe Focus 12 state but as a child it would have seemed so natural (as these states are).
<br>
<br>
Your fiancée will always be connected to you, because there is no separation within consciousness. Those of us who have lost a loved one so close are best placed to know this, because they enter our "dreams" and we know we are with them. We know it is more than "just a dream".
<br>
<br>
Yep, that's right, you can travel around the universe or the universe can travel around you. This latter point I am attempting to bring into the objective awareness of my students. Simply standing still and shifting one's perception is a whole load easier and more controlled than flying around here, there and everywhere.
<br>
<br>
You say you cannot wait to checkout Focus 3 but you are already having Focus 3 experiences. Okay, it sounds from what you say a little bit of an F2/F3 overlay experience but you are absolutely right there. Next time you see your fiancée simply hold his hand and ask him to take you with him, ask him to take you "home".
<br>

--it wasn't your mistake; I understood what you had said, but I just started running with the idea, just sort of writing down my thoughts as I went along.

That just happens sometimes, as you'll probably come to notice.

--thank you so much for giving me some confirmation, as well as consolation.  I believe it's true that we always are connected with our loved ones; sometimes I get hung up on missing his physical presence.  But I believe that our relationship now may become even better and closer!
<br>
<br>
I am so excited to know that I have gotten off to a good start with phasing!  Who knew that admiring those pretty dancing colors could come to have such significance?

I look forward to practicing with consciously initiating my experiences.
<br>
<br>
I think my fiance is waiting for me.  He's always sending me "signs" in the physical world, usually through birds.  And one time flowers.  I think he knows I am capable of coming to him---he always listened patiently when I would start talking about "strange" things like this.

Yes, I know what you mean about the missing physical presence bit. But it's all an experience process that is designed to introduce us to a wider knowing of ourselves and others. Sometimes events come about that bowl you over at first, and then you realise the complete picture. After such an event, you cannot help but relate to an expanded knowing of the wider reality. Things that people without such experience would simply overlook.  Elements of nature are highlighted specifically. I know only too well what you mean.

<br>
Very interesting post, thank you for sharing!
<br>
<br>
Inspiring indeed. I wanted to start a new thread but your post is closely related to the questions I have about phasing versus traditional obe, e.g. shifting consciousness versus moving out of body.
<br>
<br>
2 days ago, I had quite a strong experience (to me -- I'm really in my early attempts to project). I had not planned to AP that night, it was hot, could not sleep and at some point lied on my back. It was around 02:30 am as I wrote down in my journal. But I cannot sleep in that position (dunno why), for years I always linked this position to "meditation". So I naturally started to do some rundown and eventually reached a state I've understood recently to be related to Fz (3D blackness, room getting bigger, etc). So, I said to myself "Ok : now that may be a good moment to do Frank's noticing exercise ! Form an intent and look in this 3D space for changes". I tried it...but nothing triggered my attention. After a while, I felt it was enough for the moment and decided to sleep. I usually change position at that point, but an idea came to my mind to try to fall asleep remaining on my back (silly idea -- lol). So I did. As I began to lose wakefulness progressively, rapid flashes of hypnagogic imagery imprinted my mind, quite fuzzy, but could not fall asleep. Then suddenly the flashes stopped and I perceived a diffuse and clear light. This stroke my mind and I became alert again. Also I felt more "ready" to AP than usual. An idea came about invoking angelic and guides. I imagined 2 vertical rays, one going to my brow chakra, the second to my heart chakra. I formed an intent to project and asked for help. A lady did not "came" as happened for you but kind of an inner dialog started. Reassurance words and guidance. I felt lateral waves, as if I was pulled from one side. It was quite a weird feeling, because the pull was strong yet not solid since I almost don't have physical input at that point. It was like the energy body is pulled by energy waves while the head energy (?) remains fixed.
<br>
Then I attempted some circular motion. The effect was strong, I did feel the movement. I became quite excited because I was "unhooking". My heart chakra started throbbing (happened a lot of times during meditation) and for the first time my brow chakra started throbbing also. Then I suddenly felt a strong sensation around the solar plexus chakra (stomach), a bit like the feeling we can feel in a lift. I felt as if a projection reflex was about to kick in. My hands were free. Apprehensive, I opened the eyes briefly, tried to calm down a few seconds for what seemed the final step, closed my eyes, but remained hesitating. An idea "better take little steps" came to my mind. So I decided to stop. I felt and still feel deep gratitude for the guidance and also for all that I'm learning in the forum!
<br>
<br>
The experience raised nevertheless some issue : I realize I was much more inclined to go out of my body rather than phasing ! And guidance seemed to help me more in this way. Maybe to address my expectations ? Also, the strong feelings in my body...this is more OBE stuff!
<br>
Something I want to ask you is : how can you remain still ? Are you not tempted to "move" ? I believe in the fact AP does not consist of going to another place but rather to focus within consciousness. But isn't it much more natural -- especially for a beginner -- to travel through the universe rather than making the universe travel around you ? I suspect that Phasing might be considered as "easier and better" for advanced people, but isn't this because those people are already experienced in traditional OBE ? Isn't OBE (going out of body) a natural way to begin for a beginner ? Also, considering the experience I reported above, should I go on more with the OBE approach or do you advise me to keep exploring Phasing ?
<br>

Hi Eagle,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing your experience.  I am just learning about all this myself.
<br>
<br>
I find that phasing really comes easily to me.  The experiences I've had have just happened on their own, without my willingly doing anything. Maybe because I am a very introverted, introspective type, I don't know.  I have always been one to sit still, to sort of detach myself from the world around me, and just spend time with my thoughts and with the images inside my mind.
<br>
<br>
I've tried OBE on and off throughout my life, but never had any success with it.  But it sounds like that comes more easily to you.  I would say, go with what you already know!  You'll end up in the same place whichever method you use, so I don't think you have to choose.  Honestly, I feel like phasing chose me, rather than the other way around!  Since I didn't even know what phasing was when I had my first experiences!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
If you are still interested in phasing, you might want to start by just doing the Noticing Exercise.  I think that's the first step, and then once you are good at seeing images, then start doing the rundown.  I think that's how it goes.

Hello
<br>
<br>
I thought you had already some experience in traditional OBE.
<br>
Anyway, that's quite impressive that you experience such dramatic experiences with phasing so naturally! lucky you
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
<br>
<br>
Yes, I will go on with the noticing exercise. Despite it seems I'm more proficient with traditional OBE (due to the experience I wrote above). I still have real fascination with what I read so far about Phasing. Actually, OBE feelings induce some fear within me, as I said at one point I remained hesitating. Since Phasing induces a smooth transition it may help.
<br>
<br>
But I wonder which method is easier for a beginner, OBE or Phasing.
<br>
Frank for example seems to consider that Phasing is easier; but isn't this due to his background in OBE ?
<br>
Because I mean, what is more natural for a beginner : moving to a space close to the body in the familiar bedroom, or moving to a unknown fancy place ?
<br>
<br>
Frank, your insight would be welcomed
