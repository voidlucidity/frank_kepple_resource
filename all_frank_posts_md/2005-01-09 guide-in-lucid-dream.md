Does anyone have success contacting their guide/guardian angel/totem/etc. in lucid dreams?  I attempted this but since it was a lucid dream I have no idea if the guy was real(I am almost positive he wasn't my guide) or just something I created.
<br>
<br>
I asked for my guide and a few seconds later coming around the corner is a guy in this chariot and we greeted each other.  After talking to him for a minute I told him that I didn't have long because I will be waking up shortly(I didn't know how long I could hold the dream).  So I was like what's your name, how do I know you are really my guide?  And he said "Hold on a minute I gotta take a cigarette break, then I will answer your question."  And I said, "Umm first off that's not a real cigarette this is a lucid dream and...oh forget it, I will wait".  And after a few minutes I was like, "How about now?" Then he started talking with these other people.  Finally after about 3 or 4 minutes and yelling, "clarity now" and "stay in dream" a billion times I finally woke up.
<br>
<br>
Is there really any way to know if it was some weird spirit or just some guy I made up?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
It sounds like you met with another aspect of yourself and you were engaging in your own subjectivity.

I have the same Problem: I tried to contact my guide  2 times so far. First time a cat came running into may room (in the Astral) I thought that can't be it and did not pay any attention to the cat. Later I learned that guides show often up as animals, so maybe it was my guide?
<br>
<br>
Second experience: I wished to meet my guide, soon after that a man entered the room. I asked him what I should focus on. he said I should focus on meditation for 4 months? Was that my guide? no clue!
<br>
<br>
It is said that one should test the guide, but how do I test my guide?
<br>
<br>
To the experienced Projectors: Can you give us beginners some Tips?
<br>
How do I contact and recognize my guide?
<br>
<br>
Cheers Tom

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Problem is when you are thinking along traditional mystical lines, you have to realise you limit your thinking to a specific boxed set of beliefs. As a result, all manner of distortions can (and very often do!) occur. What you are doing is imposing your own sense of limitations on the wider reality, hence the ongoing confusion surrounding your requests to see "your guide".
<br>
<br>
All of us have an infinite number of alternate selves, together with a huge number of other focuses of Self who are engaged in all manner of other physical-world and "other world" scenarios. And I'm not counting all the zillions of probable selves, and the equally huge numbers of other, what could perhaps be called, more minor aspects of Self.
<br>
<br>
All these aspects of Self are available to us, simply because they ARE all us.
<br>
<br>
Now, given that there are an infinite number of alternate selves we can become, together with an infinite number of other focuses we can merge with, against the background of that reality, someone comes along and asks to see, "their guide". Now, the question is, how can you possibly translate that request into meaningful terms, against the background of the reality of your entire Self? It's very difficult, and that is why all manner of distortions can, and very often DO, occur.
<br>
<br>
I can comprehend what it is you want to do. But it is not so much "your guide" you need to be asking to communicate with. What you want is to communicate directly with Self or directly with your Essence, as it is often called. Others call it your Oversoul, but the word
<i>
 soul
</i>
is way too religious/mystical for my tastes. I prefer the term Self or Essence. Others attach the label Higher Self, but there is no higher or lower in consciousness.
<br>
<br>
So, instead of asking to meet with your guide, simply ask to communicate directly with Essence. This should erase the confusion. Don't worry if objectively you are unfamiliar with the term Essence. Subjectively, you will know what you mean. You don't actually need to go through any kind of "projection technique" to do this. Simply lie down and relax your mind and ask to communicate directly with Essence, and you should sense a door opening (so to speak) in your mind. It might take you a few attempts to get the hang of it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for the detailed answer Frank! I'll try to do as you said. Now, is there any way I can discern whether it is my Essence or just a Fantasy when I have a encounter with it? Or will I have a knee-jerk reaction and just know when I succeeded?
