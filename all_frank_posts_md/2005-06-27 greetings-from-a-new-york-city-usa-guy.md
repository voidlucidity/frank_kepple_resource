Hello,
<br>
<br>
Greetings from New York City.
<br>
<br>
Good to be here. I have had several projections and quite frankly, I wish I could have conscious projections every night for the rest of my life- or as close as possible.
<br>
I have been a little discouraged lately for lack of moral support on AP; I won't inflict the details upon you. All positive comments will be greatly appreciated and may you all be successful and fulfilled and find happiness in your quest.
<br>
<br>
Hey, I'm headed for Hernia surgery in a few days (wed.29) so please remember me in your prayers/good intentions/meditations, whatever.
<br>
<br>
Namaste

Hello,
<br>
<br>
Welcome and good luck with your surgery. I'm sure you'll be just fine.  I understand you want to be able to project.  I feel alot the same way.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
Surgery went well Wednesday, and I managed to have a brief but difficult oobe. I separated, but I bounced around and did not get my sight. I think I was afraid to open my eyes, since I thought I might wake up. Upon loss of control I woke myself up and tried again, but to no avail. I knew that my vibes were up enough to make it happen, but it seems the energy wasn't all there, or maybe my wound is affecting my subtle bodies. Check this out- I heard stuff crash to the floor during the vibe state, when it was all over I surveyed my bedroom and nothing was out of place- nor elsewhere. Thoughts, ideas, anyone?

Hi esotericus
<br>
<br>
Glad to hear the operation went well.
<br>
<br>
Sounds are very common during projection.  Knocks, bangs and voices are all normal.  I hear the "radio" a lot.  I'm convinced I've left one on somewhere, but when I go and check, it's all quiet.
<br>
<br>
The noises can be very distracting and they often make me forget what my plan is.  Over time, I've learnt to ignore them.
<br>
<br>
