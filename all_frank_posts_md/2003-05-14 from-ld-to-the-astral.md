What are techniques you all use for turning a lucid dream into an astral projection?
<br>
<br>
A few nights ago I became lucid in a dream and I cleared my mind by focusing my awareness on the back of my head. The scene around me just peeled away really fast, but not instantaneous and I found myself standing in my r/t room.
<br>
<br>
At this point I normally try to find something colorful or a tunnel to take me to the astral. But I remembered reading something RB wrote about using the cover of Astral Dynamics as a way to enter. I jumped into the book.. well i put my head in and kinda tried to fall into it. There was a swirling color thing I was in where I tried to leave in one of the colorful parts. I ended up in shopping mall type place to hotel type places filled with people. I made a point to say hi to each of them and they sort of looked up and said a friendly hi. I was trying to figure out if I was really in an AP or a LD which my mind created.
<br>
<br>
I remember there was a man and woman in the sauna at the hotel I fell into and he was singing a really weird song. It was really detailed though and I thought to myself "there's no way I made that song up".
<br>
<br>
I still dont know what the astral looks like compared to a dream. One thing I tried to do was to control my environment and fly into the air. I wasn't able to do it and in Lucid Dreams its very easy to do. Maybe this was an indication I was in more of an astral location than a Lucid dream? I also tried to keep my mind clear so I wouldnt add to the scenery around me.
<br>
<br>
Anyone here have a method of your own of how to make sure you're not still in a Lucid dream. I realize they're closely connected which is why I prefer to "step out" of my body using the rope method as a method for OBE. I've only done it this way twice where I was conscious from trance state to stepping out of my body. IT seems I feel I need this proof in order to know what is outside me isn't a dream I created.
<br>
<br>
Anyone have a method you've used which goes from LD to the astral? I wwas very happy the book cover thing worked for me because I have spent countless lucid dreams trying to find some kind of opening. I was very pleased to be in a swirling tunnel finally.
<br>
<br>
Anyway thought I'd share.. I know a lot of what I read in here I remember when lucid.

a method thats popular among occult sites that are sort of in the dark (compared to this site anyway) is to climb on top of a dresser or building or whatever while ld'ing and then jump off. its supposed to trigger something in your mind, the falling sensation thing. i've never obe'd before so i dont know how well it works.

An Astral projection is very similar to a lucid dream in respect of how the Astral looks. However, there is one *major* difference between the two: which is your level of realisation ability and degree of conscious control.
<br>
<br>
For years, projecting from "waking up" within a dream was a method I used to good effect. My basic test was to check whether I could think independently of my surroundings. So the moment I realised I was dreaming I'd immediately become completely still, both in body and in mind. At which point any dream elements would fade away. Another thing I still do is to regularly stop what I am doing and ask myself a question about something. This prevents me from getting mentally carried away by my surroundings.
<br>
<br>
The fact you couldn't fly is a strong indication you had quite a good level of realisation about you. The greater the level of realisation, generally the harder it is to fly. Well, that's what I found. It's because there is a part of you which is saying something like, "Me, fly? Don't be daft there's no way I can fly! That's all dreamland stuff!" So you remain grounded. But the ability does come with practice.
<br>
<br>
Once you establish mental control, I found it best just to accept the surroundings as being "real" in the sense of not being just dreamscape. It is natural to doubt. But releasing feelings of doubt, within the Astral environment, will tend to bring about circumstances which
<i>
 reinforce
</i>
that doubt. Which is obviously counter-productive.
<br>
<br>
I found it far better, rather than scouting around for proof, just to remain neutral and interact with the people there. After a while you will have come across across loads of circumstances where you just knew you could not possibly be dreaming, or otherwise creating the situation. Like where you came across the man singing in the sauna and you knew there was no way you were making that up. The couple you saw were probably guides. Chances are, their actions were designed to cause you to come to that very conclusion.

Sometime when I'm dreaming and become aware of it and stopping whatever I was doing the surrounding seems to "change" into another. The scene peeled away sort of fast but not instantenous as you say. Peeling the illusions come to mind. Most of the time I get right to the astral.
<br>
<br>
Other time when I'm aware of dreaming I come to my body and then I take it from there as I was already in a very relaxed and aware state.
<br>
<br>
The environment seems much more stable compared to LD where you tend to hop here and there.

Thanks everyone for replying..
<br>
<br>
Frank, I really liked what you put about the singing people being guildes.  The song wasn't even in english it was something I didnt understand but it wasn't jibberish... and it sounded good.  That hadn't even occured to me.  I think ill definitely remember your advice on not doubting it because that makes sense.
<br>
<br>
I once remembered your advice on fear in the astral and it actually helped me in another lucid dream I had.  So the doubt thing makes sense.
<br>
<br>
no leaf,
<br>
I used to use that method to wake up.. when I had nightmares..but never thought of it like that.  It might work since it would bring me to my body I guess and maybe i could project from there.
<br>
<br>
Terry,
<br>
<br>
I find the peeling away of the scene very exciting still.  Its one of the reasons I think i remember the dreams.  Its just cool.. almost like a movie.

Reason why it instantly came to mind is because I have a person called Harath who has become a regular guide. When he was very first trying to get me to "open up" to the whole guide concept, he would create these little confusing circumstances which would immediately stimulate my curiosity, and make me stop and think in various ways.
<br>
<br>
Within the Astral, fears come to life; excitement comes to life; doubt comes to life; etc., etc. Which is why it is essential to remain neutral and just retain an air of mild curiosity. There have been people I've communicated with in the past who have projected, and all their doubts about the reality of their experience have been justified to the point where nothing can now convince them it was nothing more than a simple dream.
