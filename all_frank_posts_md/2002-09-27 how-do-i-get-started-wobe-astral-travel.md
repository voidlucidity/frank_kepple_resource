Hi guys,
<br>
<br>
I ran across this site purely by chance, I have no idea how I got here, but here I am.

<br>
<br>
I have been interested in OBE and Astral / Interplanetary Travel and have tried to find information online in order to guide me into it.  I have attempted to meditate on my own, with little results.  The most I've ever 'felt' was a 'floating' sensation and that was about it.  I've never recalled 'leaving' my body or being able to see myself or even leave my body in any way.
<br>
<br>
I would appreciate any help, advice, or direction that you guys can share.  PErhaps you could point me to some helpful sites for beginners or perhaps some informative posts to help me get started.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to your replies!  Thanks!

You could check the articles at this site, also books by Robert Monroe, Albert Taylor and Astral Dynamics, by Robert Bruce.

First, recognise that the subject of Astral projection is becoming more commercialised by the day and perhaps well over 90% of the stuff that's out there is absolute kak. Second, realise that everything you need in order to travel within the Astral realms you already have within you.
<br>
<br>
If I were you, I'd also forget about attempting what is viewed as the traditional "out of body" state. This is where you end up floating out of your physical body and typically end up looking down at your physical body, lying on the bed fast asleep. Doing this is very tricky and can be subject to all manner of reality fluctuations. Plus, despite all the hassle involved in getting to this obe state, you can't really get anywhere proper as all the "fun stuff" is on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the easiest thing to attempt (in relative terms) is Astral projection. This is where you project your focal point of awareness within the Astral realm as opposed to the Physical realm. The way you do this, in very basic terms, is to allow your physical body to fall asleep but keep your mind awake.
<br>
<br>
How you do this is up to you, in the sense of doing whatever technique you feel most comfortable with. The techniques all tend to be based on using various sets of meta-physical imagery in order to kick-start the natural phasing, or projection process.
<br>
<br>

I would add that Astral projections broadly encompass two (at least anyway) distinct types.
<br>
<br>
The traditional OBE  - which results in floating around what is known as the real time zone, but is actually the etheric zone which is a

 reflection
</b>
of the physical and can be transformed into a true Astral projection, is broadly accomplished by exteriorising awareness, until the famous "vibrations" take hold.
<br>
<br>
The true Astral projection, as I would define it anyway, is not an OBE at all, because you are not exiting your body in any way, but rather raising, or focussing, your awareness or consciousness to the Astral level, using, as Frank says, imagery as a basis. The imagination is a Spiritual faculty, not a brain based one.
<br>
<br>
My own opinion is to concentrate firmly on the latter if you truly want to progress and learn.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
