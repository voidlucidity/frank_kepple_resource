<section>
Hi,I'm new and am very interested in APing. I've been reading tons of things on it almost non-stop for a few days,but I do still have a few questions that I can't find the answer to. Hopefully someone can help,heh.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
1. Will you see ghosts the very first few times you AP,and if so will they try to talk to you or glare and stuff? Also,what do they look like?
<br>
<br>
2. Is it really true that you will see colors that are not normally seen by the human eye? Ex. I get my first OBE and my room has colors that I've never seen before.
<br>
<br>
3. Are the sounds while entering/exiting your body so loud that they scare you right back in? Because I have a tendancy to get freaked easily,lol.
<br>
<br>
4. If you have one at night,will it be night in the AP world? Same for day to?
<br>
<br>
5. Is your first OBE scary,or is it so cool that you forget your freaked out?
<br>
<br>
6. I heard that when you look at your physical body while APing,it looks so wierd that it scares you right back into your body. True?
<br>
<br>
7. Will you see other APers while APing if you leave your home?
<br>
<br>
8. How long did it take you to have your first OBE?
<br>
<br>
9. Do you feel all your normal emotions? Or are some eliminated?
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the many questions...I just really want to try this out to see the things other people have claimed to see,and to maybe contact dead relatives once I get more used to it.

<br>
<br>
What do you mean by "ghosts"?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 2. Is it really true that you will see colors that are not normally seen by the human eye? Ex. I get my first OBE and my room has colors that I've never seen before.
</i>
<br>
<br>
No, colours are essentially the same although you may well view your room differently as a result of overlay experiences.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 3. Are the sounds while entering/exiting your body so loud that they scare you right back in? Because I have a tendancy to get freaked easily,lol.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Then prepare to be freaked quite a few times at first.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 4. If you have one at night,will it be night in the AP world? Same for day to?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Night and day are physical realm constructs only and the notions do not correlate between areas of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 5. Is your first OBE scary,or is it so cool that you forget your freaked out?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Many people get freaked out. Some people take it in their stride. The latter I'd guess are in the minority. But I think they are a steadily growing minority as we progressively shake off the Dark Age doom and gloom that has haunted this topic for many, many generations perpetuated by religious zealots and mystics.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 6. I heard that when you look at your physical body while APing,it looks so wierd that it scares you right back into your body. True?

<br>
<br>
If that is what you believe then true. If you believe otherwise then true.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 7. Will you see other APers while APing if you leave your home?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Maybe, maybe not. Depends on your abilities to perceive.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 8. How long did it take you to have your first OBE?
</i>
<br>
<br>
About 6 months.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 9. Do you feel all your normal emotions? Or are some eliminated?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Quite the opposite.

Frank, can I ask you the same question about RTZ at night ?
<br>
<br>
This is something that actually tends to refrain me. I'm afraid that if I project into RTZ at night, i may find myself in kind of a gloomy environment, thus potentially be subject to fears. And I believe those fears may very well manifest due to the effect of feelings on the experienced environment.
<br>
<br>
Do we perceive RTZ at night the same way as in waking reality ? I've read something long time ago about a projector describing his environment as being more luminous and bluish.

<section>
Well, what i do is try to put a bit of overlay into your rtz experience, so once your there and its dark, just imagine yourself with a torch or even imagine the lights on. This will illuminate everything. The trick is to just allow enough overlay to give you that without alowing it to swamp you and make you slip out of the rtz completely.. can be a tricky balancing act but I can usually get away with it these days.

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
If you start getting afraid that you will find yourself in a gloomy and scary environment then... you will!
<br>
<br>
You can create whatever environment you like, though people will always be subject to fears. There is no getting around this. I still lose it now and again. Okay it's quite a rare event for me now but it still happens where I get zapped back to physical, and I end up chuckling my socks off for being so stupid.
<br>
<br>
The key is to recognise these effects for what they are rather than keep thinking of them as some "thing" separate from yourself. Unfortunately, this topic is still haunted by Dark Age doom and gloom and I really do not know what it is about religious zealots and mystics who feel they have some kind of monopoly on the Wider Reality and seek to continually impose their brand of non-physical prejudice upon us.
<br>
<br>
I get 2 or 3 emails every week from religious zealots telling me I'm going to "burn in hell" and calling upon me to repent for my "heathen" ways. Or typically I get the mystics writing to me about "Karma" and how I'm gonna have to pay for all this in "later lives". You just wouldn't believe how pathetic and vindictive some of these people are, while at the same time claiming to be so "enlightened". It's all water off a ducks back to me, in fact, it gives me a big laugh. But I know only too well how ever so many people get swayed by all of this.
<br>
<br>
The problem is, when people read all the gobbledegook they take it in, and many get scared out of their wits even just thinking of projecting never mind doing it! I lost count of the number of times someone wrote to me after reading all the mystical blurb and now they are scared stiff, asking me if this "neg" stuff is truly all in your own mind or what.
<br>
<br>
The only way you can get around this is to develop a PROPER understanding of the way consciousness is structured within our system. Once you learn the facts of the matter, rather than listening to all the half-baked rumours and the ridiculously antiquated mystical innuendo, things do begin falling into place. I promise you.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, you've just got to get on and do it. As I've said oodles of times, the best most productive state of mind is to remain emotionally neutral, but hold just an air of mild curiosity. But if your emotions are flitting about here and there, then YOU are going to be flitting about here and there also. The key to controlling the whole experience is to keep your emotions under control, and to realise where you are in the consciousness scheme of things.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi
<br>
<br>
Gandalf,
<br>
that's a nice trick! I don't know if this makes sense, but is this possible to trigger the light before "separating" from the body? (with quotes because I understand there is no real separation)
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
yes, I agree about the necessity to remain emotionally neutral. Actually this little fear linked to darkness is quite irrational. Because I can do all the mental rundown that leads to MABA, then feel such a great peace within me...but then as I go further and feel I'm on the border to project, I get this disturbing thought of finding myself in the dark (in the unknown in some way).
<br>
One explanation might be that during several years (it's over now) I felt from times to times presences in my room. Were possibly just illusions, such as what often happens to many people during a sleep paralysis.
<br>
<br>
Projecting in early morning (as sunrise begins) might be the more natural way to deal with this...
<br>

It can be possible. When you start seeing 'astral' when still in body, which can happen. People often report seeing through their closed eyelids for example, although I have never done this.

</b>
<br>
<br>
You may see some ghostly apparitions. Whether it is a ghost or not, who knows. I wouldnt worry about any ghosties glaring and stuff at ya. If you get uncomfortable give a laugh and poke fun at their glares. Tell them to "shoo, move along, there is nothing to see here."

<br>
<br>
I always thought that we were wired to see a certain set of colors and nothing beyond. maybe your friend is an alien.

<br>

 3. Are the sounds while entering/exiting your body so loud that they scare you right back in? Because I have a tendancy to get freaked easily,lol.
</b>
<br>
<br>
Yea, but you know what, you start to expect it and get used to it, youll see it as something normal and not something to get freaked out about.
<br>
In the beggining it may be a door slamming or a random loud pop, brush it off, there is really nothing too glamorous about it.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 4. If you have one at night,will it be night in the AP world? Same for day to?
</b>
<br>
<br>
Seems like most of the time if it is night-time when you project it will be night-time when you are "out". I find the the more dream-like quality projections dont follow suit.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 5. Is your first OBE scary,or is it so cool that you forget your freaked out?
</b>
<br>
<br>
Its a bit like being on your first roller coaster. Think of what comes to mind when your at the top of the hill of a rollercoaster about ready to shoot down to a ride of your life. You may be screaming to yourself" I KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA!!" but you go ahead and do it anyways because you are the adventurous type. Its much more lively if you open up, yell out and enjoy the ride, the same goes for projecting.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 6. I heard that when you look at your physical body while APing,it looks so wierd that it scares you right back into your body. True?
</b>
<br>
<br>
Do you get so scared looking at yourself in the mirror? Its just you laying there, you have control and can come back whenever you want.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 7. Will you see other APers while APing if you leave your home?
</b>
<br>
<br>
I guess that is possible. i havnt bothered to find out if they are actually other people aping.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 8. How long did it take you to have your first OBE?
</b>
<br>
<br>
quickly.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 9. Do you feel all your normal emotions? Or are some eliminated?
</b>
<br>
<br>
You feel all of them and then some. Looking for scenarios to heighten your feelings is one of the nice things about projecting. Many times the feeling from the experience will carry over into your normal life.

Hi
<br>
<br>
Gandalf,
<br>
I guess you're talking about Astral sight, isn't it? This could be a great help!
<br>
<br>
Is this something that can be trained?
<br>
Does anyone know if there are exercises that specifically develop Astral sight?

<section>
xXAmayaXx,
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know Frank and Michael_E added their responses, so I decided to give you a third opinion and my .2 worth.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>
 1. Will you see ghosts the very first few times you AP,and if so will they try to talk to you or glare and stuff? Also,what do they look like?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Ghosts are nothing more then people who've passed from the physical and into the astral manifesting in the lower levels. When I'm out I see people that are just like you and me. Nothing anything different as if you were to walk down your street or in a public area. You might run into weird entities every so often, but for the most part its all physical perception.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 2. Is it really true that you will see colors that are not normally seen by the human eye? Ex. I get my first OBE and my room has colors that I've never seen before.
</i>
<br>
<br>
I really don't see any colors that are new or different. I know that my perception of the world around me is electrified and the view is alive. It seems to be much brighter, vivid, very clear, and flowing with energy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>
 3. Are the sounds while entering/exiting your body so loud that they scare you right back in? Because I have a tendency to get freaked easily,lol.
</i>
<br>
<br>
I've heard sounds and been in tight situation's that really freaked me out. Not a pleasant experience to go thru but at times I think this is something we really need to experience to get over our fears.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>
 4. If you have one at night,will it be night in the AP world? Same for day to?
</i>
<br>
<br>
I've had projections that it didn't matter the time of day or night. It could be daytime in the physical and its night or vice versa. I prefer to project during the light because its easier to see things and our society usually associates night time = evil, scary which is b.s.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 5. Is your first OBE scary,or is it so cool that you forget your freaked out?
</i>
<br>
<br>
My first OBE was scary because I didn't know what was actually happening. Even though, it took me about 2 months prior with reading up on the subject, practice, reciting affirmations it still was a shock to the system. In a nutshell, I almost threw in the towel on this oobe phenomenal and started to think that it wasn't real. At the time I was reading a astral projection book by Janet E. Lee. I was driven to keep reading the book but very tired and wanted to take a nap.
<br>
<br>
Once I closed my eyes and let go of hope of trying so hard to project it was matter of minutes I was out. I had problems putting my shoes on because my hand kept passing thru. It was daylight in the room and in the physical it was dark and there was a apple on the bed. I couldn't figure out what the hell was happening. I then remember "the book" and as I started floated towards the book I was being pulled back falling. Then the terror built inside and it just was not a good scene. I hit hard with running emotions, terror of slamming back into my body. Once I awakened, my heart was racing, I was sweating and the icing on the cake I was in complete darkness. I bolted out of the room so dam fast that I went flying up the steps and into the hallway when it striked me down like lightning. That I experienced my first full blown astral projection. When I realized this I was jumping for joy, called all my friends, family and was driven to succeed.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 6. I heard that when you look at your physical body while APing,it looks so weird that it scares you right back into your body. True?
</i>
<br>
<br>
I've touched my physical body (felt myself up.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
j/k), but seriously. It doesn't look anything different from what I could see. It is a weird and remote feeling when you're looking back at yourself or touching. But reality sinks in real well that we're nothing more then energy.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 7. Will you see other APers while APing if you leave your home?
</i>
<br>
<br>
I do question people in the astral and most of the time I get this glossy look like their stoned or don't know what I am talking about. Either they have passed on or dreaming.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 8. How long did it take you to have your first OBE?
</i>
<br>
<br>
About 2 months.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 9. Do you feel all your normal emotions? Or are some eliminated?
</i>
<br>
<br>
All emotions are intact when projecting..
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the length of this post reply.
