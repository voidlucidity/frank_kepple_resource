<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
) and i live just outside of London.
<br>
I've just discovered your site, well i found it while i was investigating certain occurences that i've experienced, on another site.
<br>
<br>
Having looked over the FAQ and a lot of other posts here, i realise this is not to entered into lightly, and with much respect to the subject and the people within it, i intend to learn and with that i hope you will forgive any really stupid posts of mine in advance (hopefully not too many

<section>
Thank you all for the kind greeting.
<br>
<br>
You know, it's funny, i started out investigating sleep paralysis, thinking perhaps i might be suffering - but, as i delved deeper into the subject, i became aware that i had too few symptoms. I personally do not believe this to be the case.
<br>
Let me briefly explain.
<br>
Many years ago (probably 15 or so) ,something strange happened to me just before i went to sleep. I was lying down, quite, peaceful, eyes closed but i was not asleep.
<br>
Forgive the longwindedness of this it's quite difficult to explain, basically i began to see the ceiling (eyes still closed) but what really unsettled me was when it seemed to get nearer, i could make out the artex,it felt /looked as if my nose could actually touch it. I physically opened my eyes felt a panic, got up, walked about and eventually went back to bed and slept.
<br>
About 10 years ago a similar event happened only this time, i didn't see the ceiling, i saw what i can only describe as a metal wall (i could see the rivets about an inch in diameter and about 7 inches apart and a curious metal (I'm assuming it was metal) grille, this time though, i fell to sleep.
<br>
Sorry, im getting to the last bit honest
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
The next episode happen a few months ago, again relaxed calm, eyes closed, then i began to see the room again, but this time it was different, i felt no movement, but, i could pan my vision and see every detail in the room, ceiling walls everything. I physically opened my eyes again though about what had just happened then closed my eye and slept.
<br>
<br>
What do you think of all this? do you think i've gotta screw loose

<br>
Any comments much appreciated.
<br>
<br>
P.S
<br>
<br>

Welcome to the AP forum Chris
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you've had some spontaneous out of body experiences. My first was when I was 17. It came with vibrations, sleep paralysis, and floating near the ceiling. There have been a few more since that I can recall, always at some point close to the sleep state.
<br>
<br>
What you describe is not crazy. Perhaps more common than many folks would like to admit.

<br>
Very best,

<section>
Thanks Nick
<br>
<br>
Well i guess I'm in the right forum to start researching
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
I know absolutely zip about the things mentioned in detail here, so, would studying meditation basic method be a good starting point?
<br>
Looks like an ocean of knowledge to try and assimilate and i feel a bit like Nemo right now

Frank. Â Having kids is like nothing else, when you have a bad day just looking at them gives you that Ahhhhhhhh feeling and everything seems to fall into perspective

But the nappy thing, Ugh! that's something i'll never get used too
