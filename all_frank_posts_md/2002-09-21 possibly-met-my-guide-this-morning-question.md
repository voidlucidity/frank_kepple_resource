This is posted directly from my OBE Journal.
<br>
<br>
/************************/
<br>
<br>
I had two this morning, but I don't hardly remember them.
<br>
<br>
I remember with the first one that I rolled out of my body, and walked into the front room of my house.  My main intention was to find my guide.  I started shouting "GUIDE!  GUIDE!"  It was funny to hear my voice, but it sounded relatively normal.  I headed for the door and decided to walk through it.  I remember thinking, "The first person I see when I get out there, I'm going to ask him about my guide."
<br>
<br>
I walked outside and it was pretty light out.  No one was around though.  I kept looking, thinking that the first person I see could very well BE my guide.
<br>
<br>
No sooner did I think this when I sports car (mustang, I think) drove up and parked in front of my house.  There was only one man in the car, and he looked either native american or indian.  Clean shaven, young, very fit.
<br>
<br>
Then I lost memory.  I think I jumped in the car with him and we started to go someplace, but I don't remember what happened.  Nor do I remember another OBE I had this same morning, right after this one.
<br>
<br>
/****************************/
<br>
<br>
I'm such a dork!  You should have seen me, walking around my house shouting, "Guide!  Guide!"  Hehehe.
<br>
<br>
One very important thing I want to ask to all you experienced projectors.....Do you find that the MORE OBE's that you have, the harder it is to sometimes remember them?  For example, when I was first starting to have them, I remembered them very clearly.  But after having more than one hundred now, sometimes it's so natural that I forget a lot of details.  Of course, lately I've had my experiences in the early morning hours where I just go back to sleep afterwards.  This definetly affects the memory recall of the experience.
<br>
<br>
Does this happen to anyone else, where you've had so many OBE's in the past that the experience sometimes gets dulled and you don't remember them as clearly as your earlier ones?

I'm not very experienced but I would think it would be the same as dream recall.  If you practice recalling your dreams you get better at it.  Its a question of  training the mind.  Definately writing them down as soon as you have had one - keep a small tape recorder by the bed to get the details real quick.  You can type them up later.

Jeff: what I find is falling asleep afterwards is not the way to go if you want good recall (as you have observed also). Many a good projection I have spoilt by thinking, "Oh, I'll remember, I'll have a short nap and make some notes in half an hour or so." And when I wake up, everything has gone from being crystal clear to very sketchy indeed.
<br>
<br>
When you met the person in the car (who I'm sure was a guide that made themselves known as a result of your calling) it may have touched against some aspect of a belief you hold, that is contrary to the experience of meeting a guide. In the sense of, maybe (deep down) you never really expected someone to literally turn up in the way they did.
<br>
<br>
What I find is, when this happens with me - where I'm perceiving something that is contrary to some belief I hold - there is a protective aspect of my conscious awareness that shuts down the experience in order to protect my belief in whatever it happens to be. This would happen a lot in the beginning when projecting underwater, for example. I'd go underwater and the experience would fade out because of my belief it was impossible to swim underwater without scuba gear.
<br>

I used to think to myself, when I see a guide, it'll be someone wise looking, in a long flowing robe or some other mystical attire.
<br>
<br>
Lately, though, I've rid my thoughts of these preconceived notions.  That's why this last projection, I told myself, 'Self, the next person you see is probably going to be a guide.'  That is when this man in a car drove up and looked at me, as if to say, "You called?"  LOL
<br>
<br>
Next time I get out, I hope to concentrate on this experience to bring this guy back, and strike up a conversation.

Funny this topic should come up. I think I met my guide today too, and like you Jeff, I don't remember very much about it.
<br>
<br>
I have been experimenting a bit with automatic writing lately, more as a way to get some ideas for poems etc. and come up with some cool imagery!  The process feels similar to becoming open to hypnogogic imagery. Anyway, today I decided to try it more as a form of communication (something I'm still a bit skeptical of) and I started asking some questions, basic yes or no and one word answers. I deduced that i had made contact with my maternal grandfather, who died of a sudden heart attack when I was two weeks old. I was his first grandchild, and I've always felt the absence of him in the physical world and wondered if he was "watching over me" - even as a child, I wondered. He told me to start singing again, and when I asked him if he was able to assist me with my Astral Projection, the answer was yes. I asked what I should call him, and he wrote "grandpa", which is interesting to me, because that's something we've never used in our family (or perhaps it was reserved for him??) - the others were "pop", "great-grandad" etc.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, so I had a nap later on in the day, and woke up out of body. I called out "grandpa!" And there he was! I only have one photo, his wedding photo, so I'm not sure of the likeness or whatever. This man was about 40ish ? (my grandfather died at 47), and he had a very stable, comforting, earthy, gentle sense about him. We spoke, but I can't remember what we said because I woke up soon after and promised myself I'd write it down after another 5 minutes of sleep. GRR! Anyway, I do remember taking his hands and kissing them. There was a sense of love between us.
<br>
<br>
What does everyone think about this? I am a bit wary of entities pretending to be someone they're not. And the whole experience was so confused that I don't really know what to make of it. What are the chances of my "guide" being a deceased relative? What do you all think of automatic writing?

I think you're guide could be anyone.  You probably have many guides out there.  Whether it's your deceased grandfather or someone else taking his form in order to make friendly contact is completely feasable.
<br>
<br>
I think you can discern a good entity from a bad one by their actions.  If you get a bad feeling about anyone (in the physical or non-physical world), you should heed those feelings.  Sounds to me like you and your grandpa hit it off pretty good, even though you don't remember the details of it.  Don't you just HATE that?!

<br>
I don't think too much about that.  Ironically, this old friend of mine, who is a born again christian, is secretly into that.  While she thinks OBE's are of the devil, she has no problems with automatic writing, since she justifies it by saying, "God wrote through the prophets and men when writing the Bible.  I see it as the same thing, only He helps me write poems and things like that."
<br>
<br>
That right there proved to me that people will believe whatever they want to believe, and convince themselves of anything to fit into their own ideology.

Hey Jeff,
<br>
<br>
Neat guide. Neat car. (And thanks for the tip about staring, in the other thread.)
<br>
<br>
You asked about memory. I have had in the dozens of OBE's/ld's. Not sure if I have broken a hundred or not. But I have sure seen a difference in my memory and reaction to them. I have thought it is because now they are ho-hum, whereas at first they were so radically different from normal sleep.
<br>
<br>
So like you, I don't remember them as well, they aren't as startling, etcetera.
<br>
<br>
That sounds grim, but the flip side is that it is like anything else --- with experience you lose the novelty but you gain ability. (under the lucid dreaming forum I posted about how yesterday I was able to react to an inconsistent lucid environment in a calm and reasoned way. It didn't frustrate me, for the first time! And it wasn't because I didn't want to be frustrated, but because I recognized that the environment was a valuable opportunity even if it was shifting on me.) So you know, Iguess the thrill is gone but there is a lot to be said for being able to navigate the environment rationally. It seems clear that you have gained some exp[ertise in your travels.
<br>
<br>
(Incidentally, regarding being a dork. I'm still jumping when I am out, to test whether I am out or not. That has to look pretty dorky - there goes patty, jumping up to the ceiling again because she can't tell if she's in body or not!)
<br>

Still smiling,

I know EXACTLY what you mean.  I remember back in 1998 when I was desiring to have an OBE for the very first time.  If back then, someone were to tell me, "You know Jeff, there may come a time when you will have OBE's, but they just won't be that exciting and you'll probably forget them," I would have told that person that they were nuts!
<br>
<br>
But it's true.  Even though every time I get out of body, I am ecstatic, I usually don't have the mind-blowing, "let's-jump'up-and-down-to-celebrate" mentality that I used to have.  I think what I will do from now on is keep a pad and paper close hand.  It won't seem like such a chore to jot down key points from my projection, as opposed to going into my office, turning on the computer, and waiting for it to come up before typing it down in my journal.

I think that with OBE's, if we were to graph their meaningfullness, it's not always an upward slope.  It usually goes up, peaks for a little, goes up, peaks for a little, etc.
<br>
<br>
For example, I have been at a peak for a while.  While still having regular experiences, nothing "exciting" or meaningful has happened.  It is during these times that I work on my control, my lucidity, controlling sexual thoughts, etc.  But now, I think I am moving upwards again, especially since I'm entering an area where I'm trying to make contact with my/a guide.  I'm sure once I establish an astral connection with him, this will lead me onto another peak of the astral graph where I will have more learning to do.

Hi Jeff,
<br>
<br>
I'm a bit late on catching up with this topic, so forgive me if I take a small backward step in the conversation. I was thinking about what you were saying about preconceived ideas about who or what your guide might be, and  just laughed. I'd always had this idea that my guide would be some wizened older fellow (sound familiar?), and to me it stood to reason that our guides would be someone of the same gender.
<br>
<br>
Man, did I ever get that wrong!!! Imagine my surprise when the one who is to be my guide walks into my life and is a young woman! Well, she's probably about the same age as the earth, but she
<i>
 looks
</i>
young (doesn't look a day over 3 billion).

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_wink.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
I can't see it, but oooh, I can just feel the look she's giving me right now!
<br>
<br>
I imagine you'll probably start to develop a really wonderful (and fun) relationship with your guide. It seems to me that after we get those preconceptions blown away,we find out that out guides are better suited to us in terms of character, personality, and how well they know us, than we could have imagined.

Hi Gandalf,
<br>
<br>
About automatic writing... What I do is just relax and get myself into a bit of a trance state where my mind is clear of thought and open. Like preparing for a conscious projection but nowhere near as deep. Getting the words feels a bit like receiving hypnogogic imagery, or like the voices you might hear when you are about to sleep... in a way, you just passively watch them. Don't let yourself think about what's coming next. Just write down what pops into your head. Until yesterday, I just wound up with bizarre combinations of words like: "Sing merry in the underground shards of titan. bring under brain curdle." (hehe) But it's been a way for me to experiment with my writing and come up with fresh and original imagery.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday felt WIERD and different to that. I actually felt my hand compelled to move in certain ways, like I imagine a ouija board would be. It happened very slowly, and the writing was pretty hard to read. When I started writing down questions with yes or no answers, I had a much better response. It came out quite clear.
<br>
<br>
Not sure what to make of it. Could be the subconscious talking - I believe a lot of psychologists use it for that reason. There's stacks of info on the net, just do a basic search.
<br>
