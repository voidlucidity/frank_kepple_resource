Focus levels are what graduates of the Monroe school use to label the various mental states that were described and taught by Robert Monroe. During the course of his work he developed what he came to term "phasing" which, if performed correctly, is a fairly seamless way of transporting one's consciousness from Physical to Astral.

Monroe was by no means the first person to attach labels to these various states of mental consciousness. Mystics throughout the ages have come up with all manner of terms. But what Monroe tried to do is attach labels and descriptions that had a more modern-day feel to them. To find out more simply do an Internet search on Monroe +"focus levels" or something like that, and I'm sure you'll come across heaps of info.
