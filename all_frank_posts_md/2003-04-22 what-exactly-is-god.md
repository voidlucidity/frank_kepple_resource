<section>
hello  to  the people
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
ive been  thinking  for  some  time  about  what  GOD is,  and  i  think   it  is  consiousness itself...  or  soul, spirit etc..
<br>
<br>
it  seems  logical  because  if, like  most people  think  that  god  is  a  seperate,  sentient  being  who can  identify  himself  as  the creator  of  existence e.g.  "i  AM  god,   i  created all that is"   then  what  is  it  that  is  animates  god?
<br>
<br>
when  religions  preach  about  unity,  i  think  this  is  what they mean,  that  at  base level,  disregarding  our  personalities  and  accumulated experiences,  we  are  consioussness-  nothing more,  no  sense  of  self  and  no earthly  identity... just  life essence ITSELF.
<br>
<br>
hence,  god  is  life essense,   the  universal  power   which  makes it possible  for  us  to  be  aware of  our  own  existence.
<br>
The  fundamental  force or  energy behind  EVERYTHING  in  existence in  all  the  differnet  realities  and  dimensions,  from  the  physical to  the astral  to the  buddhic  etc...
<br>
<br>
could  anyone  tell me  what    religion/s  shares  this beleif?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
im  under the impression  that  its  a  yoga  or  buddhist beleif.

If you want to follow that map to the top, the highest plane, then God is there. There is a system / religion called Eckankar which was created from a mixture of world religions. It emphasizes astral projection and higher level projection as a way of uniting with God. Whether you agree with them or not it is interesting to read.

Don't worry about taking advantage of them for everything they will give you for free. Just don't join or give them money.

RM: If you are interested in basic Physics, i.e. Quantum Theory, I posted a link a few days ago that explains the All-Entity concept. Maybe you might find it useful. It certainly puts a different slant on things and cuts a swathe through all the mystical jargon.
<br>
<br>
You'll find the paper here:

Hey there!
<br>
<br>
You might find Hermetic Philosophy interesting.  I have a friend who's really into it.  He recommended the book "Kybalion" by The Three Initiates to me.  Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to read it yet.  (I've got a stack of reading to get thru!)  You could check out
