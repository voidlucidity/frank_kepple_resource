hey that's a really good idea.. is anyone up to projecting during a peak time of the invasion?
<br>
<br>
or is what you would see just a made up reality of your imagination... you would have to be carefull to stay in the real time zone and not sway into an astral.

Over the past several weeks I have made repeated attempts to project and see inside Iraq. With the possible exeption of what could have been a remote viewing episode where I saw three big generators in a huge underground room (beneath Baghdad?) all attempts were unsuccessful. On one occasion I came up against what appeared to be a huge pyschic shield that resembed an enormous brick and stone wall.
<br>
Also I have yet to see any reports of anyone projecting inside Iraq. This is especially strange. With everything that has been happening it would seem natural for at least a few people to project into Iraq but apparently no one has been able to do this.
<br>
Of course it is nearly impossible to know what is happening with certainly. My own guess is that some type of psychic shield or psychic wall has been put up around the top Iraqi leaders preventing the many projectors, OBEers and remote viewers from seeing inside Iraq. No doubt the US government has tried to see inside Iraq with remote viewers. Perhaps they were successful. In any event it should be much easier to project inside Iraq once US and British units begin their advance towards Baghdad. Then both the physical defenses and the psychic shield of the Iraqis will quickly begin to crumble.

<section>
I've read accounts in the past of something I think of as a Privacy Barrier - when people are doing something they don't want others to see, that desire for privacy/secrecy seems to manifest itself in the RTZ as a barrier that astral travellers find difficult/impossible to break through.
<br>
<br>
In a country that's about to be invaded, it's not hard to imagine the population wishing for a barrier between them and the outside world - after all, the outside world is about to start chucking explosives at them. And that subconscious desire for the outside world to STAY out could easily manifest on the RTZ as a barrier a Projector couldn't pass through.
<br>
<br>
So the barrier could well just be a natural creation of the population, rather than some kind of anti-psychic-spy measure.

I also projected to bahgdad but didnt see anything you described. what i saw was basically a ghost town, except for military presence.
<br>
One unusual thing i saw was dark streaks in the sky, kind of like thick grids extending across the city. It was unpleasant, but i didnt experience it as any kind of psychic shield keeping me from observing.

Hmm... If I was good at projection i would try as much as I could. I just want to know what kinds of things are happening.

MAybe theres a bunch of invisible UFOs flying around bagdhad which only a special technology can see and Iraq is aware of it and its really the US government teeamed up with an alien race trying to intimadate saying "new naw we have this technology..." but the realy funny thing is... if suddem hussein is a Nazi teeamed with china or north korea or some excrement planning to fulfil hitler's prophecies by conquering the world and makeing it all industrialized.  MAybe theres constantly psychic was between like aliens and humans that really know what s going on in the world and is for Human evolution to live with aliens and breed with them or maybe its all a conspiracy where the higher US rankers are really nazis and want to "kill the infedels" and they made HIV to control the population. Or maybe the one and onlyu 'god' really is "Allah" and we are going to be punished for not submissing...

<section>
lets see the logic here on both sides and previous wars like yugoslavia/milochevich.  First thing they do is try and kill the leader this way the war ends immediately no casualties like they did with milochevich (ie bomb his mansion lucky he survived though).  Second scenario is if iraqi people fight you have to get them to surrender so you have to show to them how powerful you are so if they see them bombing military areas etc.. then if they see they have no chance to win then they will surrender.  Now the worst case is nobody surrenders, in that case one by one will die til they get to saddam hussein.  We all hope in any war it ends quickly and that the people surrender then very few will get killed.

I astrally projected into the brains of the three three main"players" in the "Wolrd stage"..
<br>
In iraq president Saddam's head I was lost in a myriad of tunnels which were demented and disorganised and utterly delusional..
<br>
In Blair's brain i kept bumping against a massive ego that wanted to be somebody on the world stage..
<br>
In Bush's brain.....I had TOTAL freedom of movement..the corridors were empty..vacant..nothing there....

<section>
hey what the phak, the one and only is god is Allah.... Allah is the Arabic word for God, and there is no god but God. If you really want to know what a Muslim is, it is someone who submits to God. It is believing that God passes his will over everything, and we are not the ones in control. We should realize that our freewill, our good fortune, our bad fortune, and all our power can not come to be without the will of God.
<br>
<br>
A Muslim is believing that this world is a test, and we were given our freewill by God to test us. We were given our souls to test us. Whoever does wrong to other people, they are wronging their own souls.
<br>
They will taste the evil of what they used to do in Hell.  Those who do good and have faith in God are helping their own souls. They will be rewarded for what they used to do in Heaven.
<br>
<br>
Jihad means to struggle, not 'holy war'. A martyr is one who fights against oppressors in the way of God. In the way of God simply means: no killing civilians, no killing soldiers who are unarmed or who surrender, and NO RISKING COLATERAL DAMAGE. In the times of Muhammad, jihad was usually fought if the religion of Islam was in danger of becoming extinct. Muhammad's enemies persecuted, oppressed and slaughtered his followers(and tried to kill him), because they wanted to wipe away the message of Islam off the face of the earth.
<br>
<br>
The Quran in my opinion is the final revelation to humanity, and a mercy unto mankind. Before Islam, Arabia was in complete chaos and anarchy. In a span of about 20 years, Islam turned the Arabs from unfaithful animals into completely civilized human beings. Islam ruled the Middle East in peace for over a millenium(except with a couple attacks from Mongols, Crusaders etc. etc.),. This ended when mainly the British broke up the Islamic empire, and turned the middle east into the chaos it is today.

<section>
DJMidgetMan, those are some mighty big words that I would love to contradict.  I could argue the
<b>
 one and only
</b>
God's name is
<i>
 Jehovah
</i>
, not
<i>
 Allah
</i>
.  Tell me I'm wrong.  How do you know what is right?  The only reason you believe what you so believe in is becuase you
<i>
 believe
</i>
in it!  If what you state
<i>
 is
</i>
the truth of the way of the Muslim, then all participating in the Al-Queda society are going to Hell.
<br>
<br>
You know what I say?  I say the only Will running this world is God's Will,
<i>
 is a bunch of horse crap
</i>
.  If I so choose to throw both of my middle fingers up at the sun and say "I am seperate from the source!," that would be MY will.  Why would God do that to itself?  I say the only truth out there for mankind is that of which we create and believe in.  The
<i>
 only
</i>
Will that is controlling the fate of the world is that of the Self.  Being what... like 6 or 7 billion humans nowadays... we all contribute equally to the order and chaos which reigns in today's era.  In another couple thousand years, giving we still even exist, there will probably be yet another dominant religion with ways of living a "righteous" life, with yet another name of God.
<br>
<br>
If
<i>
 God's will
</i>
really did dictate what goes on in the world and in peoples' lives then that force is very confused and f@cked up!  I say this because what kind of force would bring down a Messiah and tell the world what to believe in, saying it's Truth and "The only way," then a thousand years later give a completely different way of law and belief and say, "This is your last chance, you must submit." The way I see it, Muslims are only 'submitting' the existance of ourselves and it is really
<i>
 they
</i>
who try to impose belief onto others.
<br>
<br>
I think the whole idea is stupid.  My dad would always hang around these Arab guys and always had these saying... I can't remember what they actually said but it translated to "Only God permitting."  I
<b>
 hate
</b>
that!  It is
<b>
 YOU
</b>
permitting.  Are you trying to tell me that world hunger, suicides, the Columbia trajedy, 9/11, terrorist murder, pollution, and killing in the name of religion is all this
<i>
 Allah's Will?!?!
</i>
There is only the Self's Will.  Period. How could anyone argue against that?
<br>
<br>
You know what
<i>
 I
</i>
believe?! Muhammad was not even a real
<i>
 prophet
</i>
!  While meditating in a cave somewhere in that region of the world was him.  Suddenly a spirit appears in front of Muhammad (some say it was the arch-angel Gabriel, but my research says NO) and orders him to resite documents infront of him.  Trembling, Muhammad replies "I cannot read." The entity responds harshly, "Read these laws, for you shall be the leader of the Arab people." Muhammad could not read so the spirit told of the laws of the way of the Muslim.
<br>
<br>
You see the problem here?  REAL prophets had this supposed "GOD" speaking directly
<i>
 unto
</i>
them.  They had special divine powers which they would try to prove these miracles.  But nothing of Muhammad is of the like.  Muslims are just a bunch of people who developed their own belief system and think they are
<i>
 universally correct.
</i>
Well they are not.  There is no universally correct way of living.  We must decide for ourselves what is right and what is not.
<br>
<br>
I believe the judge of this "life Test" you speak of is NOT GOD or Allah, but it is YOU.  YOU look back on what you have accomplished in your life time. YOU judge what is right.  And it is YOU who will receive back 3x what you have given. (wicca's rule of 3)  The only God I believe in is that of the Self. Non other.

It doesnt matter what God's 'Name' is; its the concept that matters. And yes, acording to Islamic belief, Al-Qaeda would be going to Hell,basically because they give Islam a bad name. Usama USES and twists Islam and its concepts to his own personal goals, which is denounced in Islam.

According to Islam, your will was given to you by God, and all your power is God-given. According to Islam, He could take your will away from you at any moment at any time he pleases, but once again life is a test, and you will be brought back to know what you had done with your free will.

You could say that. Or you could say that he was illiterate and he brought to the world the most significant Arabic poetry that ever came into existence, today known as the Quran. And yes according to Islam, he did speak to God. According to Islam, He ascended the Seven Heavens(seven dimensions [

How could you believe in the Self but not in God??? Did you create yourself??? Did you create the universe you are living in right now?? Surely the universe did not create itself, and surely you did not bring yourself to life. I am also very happy that the Wicca religion has a system of punishment and reward, this the basis to striving towards becoming a good person.
<br>
<br>
I did not mean to offend you or anything, its just that it seemed that you insulted my religion, and you seemed to exclude it as a bad religion from all others by saying: "Or maybe the one and onlyu 'god' really is "Allah" and we are going to be punished for not submissing."

It really is interesting to hear about Islam from the point of view of someone who is not trying to prove anything. The "just the facts" approach helps me much more than any other.
<br>
<br>
Something which has been necessary for me to learn with my own religion is that the culture it developed in and the people who practice it are separate from the religion itself. When the general public is involved, some people are going to get confused and other people are going to distort things intentionally. Sorting through conflicting beliefs, opinions, and practices has helped me to clarify where I stand within my own religion. Learning about religions other than my own is another matter. It is still too easy for me to get confused or to be caught up in ideas which are only held by a few people.

I can logically see no practicality coming from the statement: God's Will controls us all."  I would love to argue with this to anyone who is up for it.  So are you telling me that God's Will is controlng all the chaos in the War and politics and stuff?  You must say that if you think a God controls you every action.  Why would this 'Allah' will two countries to fight with each other and slain one another?  The answer is simple.  We control our own fate, not some "predefined destiny."

We obviously see different versions of GOD, but nevertheless still agree that there is only one GOD.  I see GOD as jsut as state of being. God is Order. God is Chaos. God is good and evil.  Got is both courteous and sinister, for (I believe) to see God as every thought, emotion, self, the seen and unseen all neatly packaged into a ONE.  I believe there is no right way to describe GOD for we look at it from so many different angles.  The Universe just
<b>
 IS
</b>
.
<br>
<br>
I can't remember the specific prophet, but I remember reading a story of one of the prophets to Egypt.  "God" was supposedly speaking unto him saying to preach to the people of Egypt.  The prophet says, "Well what would I call you, what is your name?  This force says, "I have no name, I exist within and without you.
<i>
 I am you
</i>
.  Therefor you may refer to me as "I Am."  (That just kind of goes to show anyone seeing God as
<i>
 I AM
</i>
, would make a self affirmation of there Self.
<br>
<br>
I believe God is not a single thinking conciousness, but actually exists as
<b>
 all
</b>
the awarenesses and consciousnesses in the entire universe.
<br>
<br>
I refrain believing in any organized religion that teaches "This way, or the high way."
<br>
<br>
You say Al Queda are all going to hell.  Well, I'm absolutely positive, all those suide bombers and pilots don't believe that.  They believe that they are doing good for they "God."  They kill other people .... THAT GOD HAS CREATED!!!  THAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!
<br>
<br>
When a religion gets to the point of seeing their fellow "Freedom fighters" and military leaders as prophetic and messiahic (e.g. Sudam Hussein), that's when the minds of the innocent people have become manipulated.
<br>
<br>
Hitler is a perfect example: Me manuplited the minds of the general people, believeing they are superior in race and laws.  They saw this as "Right." You and I would probably see this as evil, care to disagree?  Hitler would execute innocent people for theyre beliefs.  You know that sounds like Islam nawadays, especially with the Al Queda extremists, they all put their beliefs and standards above all others, believing they are "right."
<br>
<br>
::Spits::
<br>
<br>
I seriously hate any organized religion.  You must learn, adapt, develop your own morals, and not rely on what a book says.  Almost religions support the Ten Commandments.  Because everyone agrees in the sayings, it seems universally ethical.
<br>
<br>
ok ok im done...

I have thought the same thing many times too. But the truth is, the universe is not divine. The universe is governed by laws that are NOT divine. These laws did not make them selves. The universe did not make itself. The universe is governed by specific laws, and is in
<i>
 perfect order
</i>
. The moon revolves around the Earth, the earth revolves around the sun, and the sun revolves around the galaxy.
<i>
 Perfect Order
</i>
. Also, the law of intertia: an object that is in motion, continues to be in motion unless something stops it.  An object that is not in motion stays motionless until something
<i>
 starts
</i>
it. Once again the universe did not create itself, it did not plan itself out in such perfect precision, and it did not start its own movement. Its these things that lead me to believe that the universe came to be by intelligent design and that God is seperate from His creation.

That actually has nothing at all to do with the actions of Al-qaeda. Usamas intentions are purely political but uses a twisted interpretation(which is extremely out of context) of Islam to gather his followers. He does not kill people because of theyre religion. He kills people because the U.S. kills people(1.5 million due to sanctions) and is occupying the Middle East.  Usama is not near in equivalence with the ideas of Hitler. Read Usamas speeches, especially the one after the 9/11 attack and you will know what I mean.

Well with Sadam removed there won't be a need for sanction's now will there? Now do you really think without sanctions the people would have prospered? Do you? Do you think a man who put people through paper shredders, gassed children, mutilated bodies, and so much more would let his people prosper?
<br>
<br>
With wealth comes education and freedom. Don't fool yourself. Blame it on sanctions if you want but I think that is disregarding reality. Regardless the same people who cried about sanctions are crying about removing Sadam. There is NO way to remove the man without devasting his regime. Removing WoMD would not have helped his people. Freedom has never come without a price in the history of the world.
<br>
<br>
All that aside this is the last place I would like to get into a political discussion. The bottom line is a radical movement of Islam has spread. It is devastating to women, brainwashing to children, and absolute brutal to all who disagree. It is a stone age mentality where man is supreme over women and tolerance is unacceptable.
<br>
<br>
I have never seen a religious text without flaws. Christians claim the bible is perfect. Muslims claim the quran is. Neither are and if people want to believe they are then hey, have at it. They both can be used to subject humanity into slavery and be used for sick actions. Both have aspects that reek of man made rules and human thinking not a God that loves his children.
<br>
<br>
When people stop trying to look outside for God and look inside the world will be a much better place.

Im really not in the mood to write back to you Gelfling. I was just trying to make the point that no Muslim, righteous or not, forces Islam upon anyone. The Quran's command to keep from forcing Islam on people is to blunt and concrete for anyone to misinterpret.

I agree that both can be used to subject humanity to sick actions. But both do not reek of man made rules and human thinking.

The Islam that 99% of the Muslims of today practice is the Islam that ironically is unheard and seems to have no consideration from any non-Muslim.

I suggest that you goto a local Mosque to learn about Islam and have them answer any questions that you might have. [

Bottom line is the rabbit hole is VERY deep and neither Christianity or Islam come close to touching the surface. NDE cases and quantum physics are both kinda blowing apart the old time "religions"

What kind of beliefs are NDE cases leading to???
<br>
<br>
There are many scientific implications in the Quran that seem to good to be true. For example:
<br>
<br>
"Do not the Unbelievers see That the heavens and the earth Were joined together (as one Unit of Creation), before We clove them asunder?" [Al-Qur'aan 21:30]
<br>
<br>
This very much implies the big bang theory.
<br>
<br>
There are more but i dont feel like listing them. For example there are implications of the roundness of the Earth(which Muslim scientists had concluded to be true a millenium ago), and there are implications of the development of the baby inside a womb etc. etc. without any mistakes.
<br>
<br>
What does Quantum Physics disprove?
<br>
<br>
By the way, this is a very interesting article:

Quantum physics is in no way 'blowing apart' the old religions.  Its mostly about perception even in Q physics and it will give another perception or understanding but doesn't disprove anything.

<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Most people in the world today have a need to personify a "deity" as the highest, most comprehensible "being" to them. For most people, that "being" is known as "God", Allah" "Jehova" etc., and other religions might have their "Brahma" and "Buddha" and so on. These deities fit in nicely with the religions which represent them, and their books of words for people to follow, and for most people serves as a reference point to find comfort by, as well as their own concepts of "heaven" and "hell". We all must always respect these religions and these deities as part of the path of every individual.
<br>
<br>
In reality of course, their really is only the "All", the Divine, the Akasha principle, Spirit, the Ether - the highest, and most incomprensible -  the true nature of which is only known to his/her self.
<br>
<br>
We do know that the "All" represents immutable, Universal laws, and by which absolutely everyone and everything in the Universe, in all spheres, plains, realms and dimensions are subject without exception. The "All" does not display petty human traits such as jealousy, greed, caprice, vengeance, desire to be worshipped, thanked, offered to etc,. but rather lives according to immutable Universal laws of cause and effect (The "Law"), effect always following cause in absolutely perfect sequence degree through all eternity. The most powerful driving force of the Law is perfect, unconditional Love.
<br>
<br>
In this context, these "my deity is better than your deity" and "my book is better than your book" discussions are completely moot.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
<br>

<br>
<br>
You are so confusing and contradictory toward yourself...  If
<i>
 you
</i>
are so firm with your beliefs, and
<i>
 you
</i>
see God as flowing within and without us, and see God controling our own will, wouldn't it be safe to say that the universe is God, itself??  Now how dumb would it be to say the
<i>
 Universe
</i>
is not divine.  That would be just like you saying God is
<i>
 not
</i>
divine.
<br>
<br>
It is very hard to find and construct the points you try to make, as most of them are simply repeats of what you have heard and what
<i>
 you
</i>
see to make the most sense.  You go around trying to correct people, but you have no grounds for your views..
<br>
<br>
You say the Universe is
<i>
 not
</i>
perfect,  you say God is seperate from the universe, yet you fail to explain why.
<i>
 Why
</i>
would a supposed all being,
<b>
 not
</b>
inhabit and consist of the
<i>
 ALL
</i>
??  Do you catch my drift? SAying God is seperate from the universe is also just like saying
<i>
 you
</i>
are seperate from the universe.
<br>
<br>
Tell me why the universe is not perfect.  It seems perfect to me, it is there, it exists, it simply
<b>
 IS
</b>
.  The universe is a material and non-material existance/whole that lives from a natural course of action, we are dictated by a constant cause-and-affect stream of life. Everything has its
<i>
 reasons
</i>
for happening. you say, "the moon revolves around the earth, earth revolves the sun, blah blah..." You simply point out the obvious, they happen for a
<b>
 REASON
</b>
. Scientists could list a thousand other 'laws' or workings of our galaxy and solar system.  The universe is EXACTLY the way it is
<b>
 supposed
</b>
to be, it
<b>
 is
</b>
perfect.  Now if there was no such thing as positive and negative, if
<i>
 in
</i>
did not have an
<i>
 out
</i>
, if effects did not have their causes,
<b>
 ALL
</b>
would have an arbitrary reality, it would be IMperfect.  That is not the case.

I'm sure if you were to ask Osama bin Laden himself, or any other Al-Queda member for that matter, they would call themselves 130% Muslim.  You see them as non-islamic because they kill and commit murder, they sabotage the freedom of innocence.  But they would probably see themselves as 'heroes,' getting rid of the 'infedels,' and wiping out more unbelievers.
<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein has raped the minds of his people and destroyed the way of the Muslim for the most part.  I've noticed in translations of announcements, in Iraq, while we were bombing military targets, the Iraqi government was announcing to all:  We must protect our leader, We must help our president" over and over and over.  What kind of S]-[iT is that?! Shouldn't it be like: "Our leader will protect you, we will find peace, Hussein will let no harm come to your children."  Now that would probably be something you would hear here, in the States or something.
<br>
<br>
Islam is a large factor in all the chaos overwhelming humanity as a whole.  Religion, alltogethor, must be re-shaped into a more practical point of view.

  You are so confusing and contradictory toward yourself... If you are so firm with your beliefs, and you see God as flowing within and without us, and see God controling our own will, wouldn't it be safe to say that the universe is God, itself?? Now how dumb would it be to say the Universe is not divine. That would be just like you saying God is not divine.

Well, the universe is governed by laws that are inchangable to us. The only possible answer to the universe's creation is to believe that there is a higher being that is above these laws. You have to understand that the universe is not a 'living being' itself, but mere matter. The laws of the universe are consistent and the universe does not have its own will to break these laws. It is governed by its own laws and the universe itself does not break its own laws. The only possible reasonable answer for matter to come from nothing is an intelligent being to create it. Excuse me if what i just wrote sounds like mumbling because im damn tired... [:O] Also, I have not insulted you once, why do you have to consistently procede to insult me?

Yea. (Please note that I am not trying to tell you how to think, I am just defeding my position): Our souls are seperate from the universe. We receive information from our senses which are interpreted by our souls, but our souls are literally just consciousnesses that are limited to the input they receive. When we feel a punch in the arm, for example, that is just our soul interpreting what is projected into it through the medium of the body/brain. I find it hard to believe that I came into existence and started experiencing the world, without some kind of higher being causing me to.
<br>
God, in my opinion, is seperate from creation because he is the Creator of the creation. He is beyond the laws. I cant worship the universe and everything itself, although I can recognize that everything in the universe glorifies the greatness of the creator of the universe.

  Tell me why the universe is not perfect. It seems perfect to me, it is there, it exists, it simply IS. The universe is a material and non-material existance/whole that lives from a natural course of action, we are dictated by a constant cause-and-affect stream of life. Everything has its reasons for happening. you say, "the moon revolves around the earth, earth revolves the sun, blah blah..." You simply point out the obvious, they happen for a REASON. Scientists could list a thousand other 'laws' or workings of our galaxy and solar system. The universe is EXACTLY the way it is supposed to be, it is perfect. Now if there was no such thing as positive and negative, if in did not have an out, if effects did not have their causes, ALL would have an arbitrary reality, it would be IMperfect. That is not the case.

<br>
<br>
The above quote lists all the reasons for why I believe in a one unique God. If everything has a reason, there must be a separate will that is behind them. You also list the yin/yang theory which is completely true. That is another unchangeable law of the universe. The fact is: God is the cause, the universe is the effect. God is the planner. The universe is the plan in action. God appoints these reasons, and there must be a separate "thought" for anything to take place.  The universe itself can not be god because it DOES NOT will itself into existence. It is governed by laws that can not be attributed to God Almighty, because He is completely beyond our understanding. If the universe just 'is', then that would mean it and all its matter were always present, in one form or another, and that it was

 always

in movement and creation which seems to hard for me to even comprehend... [xx(]

  I'm sure if you were to ask Osama bin Laden himself, or any other Al-Queda member for that matter, they would call themselves 130% Muslim. You see them as non-islamic because they kill and commit murder, they sabotage the freedom of innocence. But they would probably see themselves as 'heroes,' getting rid of the 'infedels,' and wiping out more unbelievers.

What kind of S]-[iT is that?! Shouldn't it be like: "Our leader will protect you, we will find peace, Hussein will let no harm come to your children."

<br>
It is not Islam that is at fault. It is not religion in itself that is at fault. It is the individuals who are at fault. If religion did not exist, the good-natured people would have no ability to grow on their good. If religion didnt exist, there would be no motivation for ANY GOOD PERSON AT ALL, to do ANYTHING about evil. There will always be evil and there will always be rebellious, prideful people who do not care about the feelings and well-being of others. These people are separate from religion. Whether religion existed or not, these people would have always existed. EVERY RELIGION HAS IT'S NUTCASES, BUT EVERY RELIGION HAS HELPED MORALIZE SOCIETY TREMENDOUSLY AND MAKE THE WORLD A MUCH BETTER PLACE WHICH SURPASSES ANY OF THE NUTCASES'S EVIL ACTIONS. If any one of the world's religions did not exist today, the world would be in a much worse shape.

Sorry to say, that this will probably be my last post on this topic, I cant spend any more time arguing over these things. I still have 4 more years of highschool to finish. [

On the contrary, here we have to excellent examples of the laws of cause and effect in operation at close range in distance and time.
<br>
<br>
The cause was to spend huge amounts of public money to arm terrorists and the Iraqi leadership for, at the time entirely selfish puposes, and the effects are attrocities like 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq with tragic consequences for all of those involved and the world and humanity generally.
<br>
<br>
This is what happens when mindless governments interfere with the Universal scheme of things, instead of allowing the Law to determine the future, as for example in Russia, China and the ex-Eastern block countries.
<br>
<br>
Of course, Bush and the puppeteers that manage him would never, ever understand or even conceive of these things.
<br>
<br>
Sadly, the effects of these causes are far from over, and not until humanity generally attains a level where these truths and realities are understood, and
<b>
 everyone
</b>
lives their lives in the Spirit in accordance with the Law, will the fabled "Heaven on Earth" be realised. This decade is critical to the future of mankind for millenia to come.

Of course the there are universal laws which all must consist by.  You are entirely correct when you say the universe does not have the Will to do whatever it wants and break these laws of physics.  But why does that have anything to do with God being seperate from the universe?  The universe is All.  Why would god be seperate from the All?  It does not make sense.
<br>
<br>
Again, there is no proof that universe has a consciousness.  This does not proof its existance, it does not disproof its existance.  The only reason why you are thinking and aware, the only reason why you have a consciousness in the first place, is because of all the inner workings and components that make you, YOU, all the interneurons in you spinal cord, the dopamine which elevates or depresses your mood, all your brain cells which enable you to think.  This is a vehicle for you consciousness.  Obviously, through OBE, one can operate his awarenes external of its own body, self proving that there may be existance after death.

Yes, the Universe is indeed "The All". "The All" can also be thought of as "Spirit" which is everything that ever was, is now and ever will be. There is nothing separate from "The All" or outside of "The All". The entire Universe is "mental", and everything within the Universe in all spheres is held within the "mind" of "The All".
<br>
<br>
I believe this is where the confusion regarding deities arises. People see the Universe on the one hand, and believe it was created by, and ruled by a deity on the other hand. In reality, "The All" is the "Akasha principle", "Spirit" the "Ether" etc.. of which
<b>
 everything
</b>
is a part without exception, separated only by vibration. Beyond the physical, we exist at the level of vibration that is equivalent to the vibration of our Astra-Mental (Soul) or Mental (Spirit) body - that is why everything seems just as solid, if not more solid in the higher/inner spheres, than here in the physical world. Everything in the physical world, including our physical bodies, vibrates at the same rate, and the same applies to the higher/inner spheres, but which are not restricted or subject to the grossness of three dimensional matter. Also, unlike here in the physical world, all beings vibrate and therefore exist at exactly the same vibrational rate in accordance with mant factors, and accordingly like always attracts like. That is why the Astral has its equivalent of "hells", belief system territories etc., because everyone withon those planes, realms, territories etc. are of "like mind" for better or for worse.

This is not strictly true. Our "minds" and "consciousness" are not part of our temporal physical bodies. Our consciousness is our Spirit, and our memories of all lives for example are stored in the causal sphere of the Akasha. When we incarnate, the Astral matrix (sometimes known as the "silver cord") is formed, and which connects us to our physical bodies. The Astral matrix is in turn connected to the Mental matrix by the purple (lavender coloured) cord. When we receive thoughts, we do so first through the Mental matrix and then on in turn to the Astral matrix where we then receive the impression as if it arrived in our "brain". Sending thoughts take the opposite route from the Astral matrix to the Mental matrix and onto the causal sphere of the Akasha, although thoughts can be intercepted by almost any being in the higher/inner sphere, depending on vibrational level, nature and object of the thought. When people pass on of course, and are resident in the Astral, then thought processes involve the Mental matrix. All direct communication is mind to mind in symbolic language.
<br>
<br>
The point is - our physical brain is merely an elaborate transmitting and receiving station. The brain does not originate its own thoughts as such.  The brain is of course a highly complex organic intrument designed to enable us to control our physical organic body. You are correct therefore when you say that the brain is a "vehicle of consciousness".

<section>
Gee..it's been a while since I've posted to these forums. I've been reading them on and off for a while tho...mainly the Prophecies one.
<br>
<br>
Anyway - I've have got SOOOOO many things that I want to say about this, and not just the war either, the US government, the state of the world, the future...I've been on this *huge* information gathering drive for like the past 2 years - I've had an almost unquenchable desire to read up on things with a conspiritorial edge to them.
<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know how anyone else here sees the US gvt., but I've been filled with a burning desire, to know the *truth* about what is happening behind the scenes, because when I see Bush on TV or one of his "colleagues", I get the *distinct* feeling that I'm missing out on a biiiiig bit of the picture. That essentially, they are telling a very small, very *sterilised* version of the story.
<br>
<br>
[?]
<br>
<br>
I DONT TRUST POLITICIANS. Full stop. Next time one of them (good example is Bush) gives a press conference or speech, instead of listening to their actual words (you could even turn the volume down), listen to their ENERGY. What does their energy tell you? Do they speak from the heart, are they passionate, honest? Or is it ego-driven, hidden behind a wall of deception, that is well hidden - do they feign concern for the interests of the world, environment, peace, education....when really...they seem to be using it as a smoke-screen for hiding something? Not that you could tell, by listening to the words - REMEMBER - these are written by proffesionals.
<br>
<br>
So, I could see that, starting 2, 3 years back (I'm 20 atm). The sense that these guys had something to hide from me, from us, the public. So - I wanted to know - what exactly ARE these guys *hiding from us??* I wanted to KNOW. So, I started searching. Conspiracies were my main interest for a while, as well as the huge dominating force of companies and corporations hell bent on making profits and their connections and involvment with the US gvt., then channelings about the state of the world, then alien involvment and manipulation in/of our world, the supposed existence of deep underground bases that begun being constructed in the 50's by a group called MJ-12, the associations and deals made between 'Greys' (your typical alien) and the US gvt. in the 40's, the supposed existence of underground facilities-release-labratories jointly shared between these 'Greys' and elements of the US gvt.......I could go on and on and on...
<br>
<br>
 Lemme stop here for a tic. It's kinda hard to keep my focus here, there is so much info stored away in this lil brain of mine it can be hard to pull out into a form that someone else can understand.
 <img alt="Insert" border="0" height="15" icon:="" sigh...="" speech="" src="images/icon_speech_sigh.gif" width="27"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 I've got somes sites I'll list at the end of this post, if you want to indulge in some further reading (highly suggested, as I'm very muddled-headed atm).
 <br>
 --
 <br>
 Anyway - as you can see so far, there seems to be a lot of focus on the US - why?. I've tried to answer this question, and quite frankly, I believe that the US is a very very important area of focus right now. Our future path is strongly determined by the path the people (or the gvt) chooses to take. It's a very powerful place, with shifts in conciousness there affecting the rest of the globe, more than almost anywhere else. It's almost like theres a spotlight shining down on the entire US, waiting, watching.
 <br>
 <br>
 It's amazing really, when you consider that this country has risen out of the ground over just the last 200 years. It has sprung up as the dominant world superpower. It's been called the land of liberty, the land of free speech and endless possibilities. It's got the Constitution. The systems of Democracy and Capitalism have fused to form one of THE most successful countries in the world. But it seems that the corporations have taken over. Big Government is really just Big Business these days.  --Did you know that the US accounts for half of the WORLD'S total of military budget spending? That's right - More than North Korea, China, Russia, Israel, Iran...and of course, Iraq, put together.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Cabinet positions seems to be held by people from military, defence, and corporate backgrounds only, these days. Go read up on the history of people like Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice...you'll find the same thread throughout - EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN A POSITION OF POWER HAS BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN BIG BUSINESS. I bet you already knew willy Cheney was a former oil company CEO in the 90's right? That Condoleezza Rice had an oil takner named after her?
 <br>
 (I suggest the excellent book, "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore.)
 <br>
 <br>
 Hey people! WAKE UP! The US government has been taken over HOOK, LINE and SINKER, and no-one seems to care....or even notice! The people giving those speeches of stirring appeals to the heart of the nation, aren't really interested in the heart of the nation. Pah! They would SELL it if could make a profit.
 <br>
 <br>
 Why do people working with defence contractors...in big corporations....sitting on the boards of the largest companies in the world...seem to rotate in and out of government positions?? Do you really think that the war in Iraq is about "Pre-emtive strikes"? About securing peace? Weapons of Mass Destruction? Regime change? Saddam?
 <br>
 <br>
 I don't. I don't know if oil has anything to do with it - but hey! Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the WORLD, and it seems that the US will be the ones setting up this new democracy in Iraq, which means, they'll decide how the oil will be handled. Hmmm...
 <br>
 They have also offered lucrative contracts to companies willing to help in the restoration of Iraq after the war...including of course, it's oilfields!
 <br>
 <br>
 Wow!
 <img alt="Insert" border="0" height="15" icon:="" speech="" src="images/icon_speech_wow.gif" width="23" wow!=""/>
 These people, with huge corporate, defence and military backgrounds, have now, seen the light. It's time to bestow peace and prosperity on the world, starting with the Iraqi people. Well, we'll nab this guy, because he's OBVIOUSLY helping terrorists (even though they haven't proved any links between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime) and has mass caches of Weapons of Mass Destruction (even though the US simply hasn't brought out it's smoking gun - which they claimed they had, of course! they just um, didn't want to...well....next quesiton!).
 <br>
 <br>
 Yet they are bosom buddies with the Saudis - who, just coincidentally have the largest oil reserves in the world. Oh, and um, they have PROVEN and CONSISTENT links with the Al-Qaeda terrorist network? That when traced, it seems that well, you know, umm...well, most of Al-Qaeda's funding came from the Saudi royal family? But hey! The Saudi's are our FRIENDS! They harbour AND fund terrorists but, I mean, hey, people make mistakes, and well, I'm sure they didn't really mean it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Did you know that Saddam got the building blocks for his biological weapons programs in the 80's from - GUESS WHO?
 <img alt="Insert" border="0" duh!="" height="15" icon:="" speech="" src="images/icon_speech_duh.gif" width="23"/>
 THE ONE AND ONLY, US GOVERNMENT! In fact one of the people that met Saddam in that time, was good ole' Donald "Rummy" Rumseld. The man with the illustrious defence background. Yep. That's right folks. Saddam would NOT have the capabilities for his Bio programs, if it wasn't for the kind folks in the US government. Of course, Rumsfeld seems to have forgotten this, when he was questioned by the senate recently. Doesn't recall any deals made. Or even that he met Saddam. No wait, he was on video meeting him, so he MUST'VE met him. But that's it, of course...
 <br>
 <br>
 Bah.
 <br>
 <br>
 Nothing there of course. I mean, these are all people who want the best for the world. They don't care too much for profits, as long as the people are happy. And peaceful! That's right.
 <br>
 -----
 <br>
 Well I must end this little tirade here. As you can all see I'm rather passionate and cynical about this. I'm actually pretty pleased with what I've written. I'm suprised, considering the deep haze of confusion I've been living with for a while. *phew* It feels good to get a little bit off my chest. but hey! I could go on.
 <br>
 <br>
 If people could reply to this, with their thoughts, emotions, feelings, insights, disagreements, whateva! Go for it - I would LOVE to hear people's response to my thoughts (rather my giant truckload of them) on this issue (or issues

 I'll wait and see the response actually, before I post anymore links for further reading.

Very interesting, you know I put a lot of time into reading and (trying to) piece everything (the TRUTH about the state of the world) together, myself.  I have heard and read of the exact same stuff that you mention, but probably am a lot less knowledgable of the conspirecies, for I have books on about it, but have not yet read any of them (still reading Body of Secrets by James Bamford, about the NSA).  I hear a lot about 'greys' and the reptilian aliens, and all the underground and, below the bottom sea level 'bases' or perhaps 'homes.' I have a book called Children of the Matrix byDAvid Icke which deals with governemt conspirecies, aliens, AIDS/HIV scam, Nazi, etc.  I have always wondered my self, what has happened to the Nazi, if they are stll in some sort of intact, powerful state?  Did Hitler have anything to do with aliens?  If the Nazi really did have UFO technology in World War II, why have we not seen it?  Did a higher ruling party take over and hide the truth about man's evolutionary outcome (if it has anything to do with aliens), is the US part of it?  Are other countries involved with extra-terrestrial life?
<br>
<br>
<b>
 My biggest questions are
</b>
-, Is it really getting close to 'armageddon,' or is mankind undergoing some sort of transformation, a new begining?  What is the truth between US and alien ties?  Is there really going to be a 'second coming?' Who/what will it be?  Will it be another messiah, what would he/she be considered?  What's this deal about there coming another Adam &amp; Eve?  I heard Rael (you know, that alien preacher guy involved with clonaid) talking about it.  When will the 'Hall of Records' be unearthed from the chambers below the Sphinx?  Supposedly, the -=History of History=- is inscribed within the documents below the Sphnix.  It should contain historical records of ATLANTIS, Osiris, Aliens, anti-gravitation technology, daily cultural life of Atlantians, *roots of mankind*.  Rael says aliens came to earth like 25,000 years ago and cloned their genes into the most evolved primates, creating a whole new breed.  What is the US's role in a 'new world order?'
<br>
<br>
Man, it's hard to sleep at night when thinking about all this, it really is mind boggling.  You know, through AP I bet someone could learn a great deal about the truth behind the lies of our world.  Too bad I still can't [

  Wow, I would try to continue with my earleir post, but I was just too awe-struken by your sense of wisdom and knowledge, I mean how exactly do you know all that stuff? What are inner-speheres? I don't recall any of those in Astral Dyanmics.  Can you regularly project?  Are you saying that all of our past lives are embedded within our silver cord?  Is one able to access memories from these past lives? If so, how?

Thank you for your comments, but there really is only one truth, and it is available to absolutely everyone who sincerely seek it and for the right motives.
<br>
<br>
The "inner spheres" are sometimes known as the "higher spheres", i.e. the Astral and Mental "planes".  These planes, spheres or realms, are actually inwards by compared to the physical world, which is the outermost manifestation of the Universe as undifferentiated matter.
<br>
<br>
No, out past memories, indeed all of our memories are stored in our causal body - that is to say our Mental body that corresponds with the causal sphere of the Akasha.  When we access these, and indeed any of the Mental spheres from our physical body, we do so though the Astral matrix and then the Mental matrix. The "Akashic records" are sometimes conceptualised as a library, but this is purely symbolic.

whatthephak i sincerely hope you know everyone has theories based on their perceptions on things.  Some are more plausable than others and some may seem to make sense.. they might even have a lot of truth to it.  But you have to create your own based on the many beliefs out there.  Beware of a person who insists their truth is the only one.

Often I find myself thinking something is the truth. Then a week later I might realize that it can't be the truth because of some flaw I see in it, so I go on to believe something else is the truth. Thus the long climb up the spiritual ladder continues, and I look down every once in a while to see how far I have come, but I can't tell. Maybe if my stupid eyelid stopped twitching I could get a better view. The intervals at which I change my opinion about the truth have decreased, which I think means I am getting closer. I don't think any one person has ever gotten or can get to the point where they KNOW the truth. I think we have to work together and figure it out as a people. (now this is a tricky problem with the leaders of the world today in charge). That's where I stand right now.

<br>
Dear goingslow,
<br>
<br>
Perhaps what is needed is a definition of the Truth.  The Truth in my definition is the Wisdom of the One Source (or what Christians call God, Muslims call Allah etc).
<br>
<br>
So by this definition, I would agree with Adrian that there is only one truth since as most religions actually agree there is only One Source.  However, you are equally correct. As soon as we manifest into the physical there are viels placed between us and THE truth.  These viels are our physical perceptions, religious beliefs, cultural beliefs etc.  It is tremendously difficult for a person to let these cultural beliefs and perceptions go because we are basically a very insecure species.  We need our security blankets and the things that we 'need' (not that we do need them but we think we do) to define ourselves so we can say.  This is who I am.
<br>
<br>
There are a few gurus, high level initiates such as Budha, Krishna, Jesus etc who have had perhaps the clearest access to THE truth that anyone incarnate has had.  However, THE truth that they give us inevitably gets twisted in short order.  This is why it is so important for each of us to attempt to strip away our viels on our own.  Strip away physical perceptions until we find a oneness with ALL.
<br>
<br>
How does one know when they are coming close to connecting to this oneness?
<br>
Well, a person who is in tune to the higher realms tends to be a very calm person.  When all hell is breaking loose they feel the pain of this world but they do not let it overwhelm them or affect their words or actions.  Why?  Because there is a connection to the higher source inside them.  They are centered, strong, loving, compassionate, and seek to help and understand no matter what or who is involved.  They have burned away that which is not real (perception, image) and understand what is real (unconditional love and all the wisdom that comes with that love).
<br>
<br>
Most of us here on earth are lucky if we grab moments of this centeredness, connection to the One Source.  Few of us can maintain it 24/7.  If we could then we would truly have access to THE truth and be able to live it 24/7. Though I think even then it would be a little BIG for us to really wrap our unexpanded minds around.  It most certainly could not be put into words without being somewhat jaded.
<br>
<br>
When we understand the above we can appreciate the degrees of truth that are offered to us.  Some are higher degrees than others.  The best way to weigh a truth is in how well it serves to increase love, understanding, compassion, expansion of thought etc. and then meditate on it ourselves.  Then if it feels true, bring it into manifestation.  For example: If I said, "The best way to learn or solve a problem is through confrontation and careless words." It would not be considered part of THE truth since it does not serve the higher purposes.  It only serves a spiral downwards.
<br>

<section>
Thats a very good way of putting it timeless.
<br>
I think the main difference is accepting there is one truth out vs. stating what that one truth is in detail such as.. there is one truth.  And here it is...
<br>
<br>
For me when i think of one big truth it sometimes reminds me of what RB described in Astral dynamics about certain colors that there are no way of explaining here in the physical.  To me thats mindblowing, to see a "color" in the astral that you couldnt explain because its beyond our understanding.  Or to think there are senses out there we are incapable of explaining not only because we dont have the words but because we have no experiences to base them or or they're beyond our perception.
<br>
<br>
I have a test i gotta run to so this is rushed.  But to me a lot of these truths are so "physical" as in they relate to eveyrthing we know.  Every sense we have and they dont take into account there are things we might be incapable of knowing.
<br>
<br>
I think someone who has really seen the "truth" most likely would not be able to describe it in physical terms such as this level and that level etc.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I agree with your response and i wasn't saying i thought there was definitely more than one truth.  I just dont think many have it and i dont think its accessable to everyone.  It might not be accessable to any of us.  In fact thats more likely.

<section>
I would consider Adrian a very wise person- if he/she (dont know) can astral project at will, try to picture all the learning and development that came from such higher sources.  We would all agree that there is only ONE Truth, as there is only one God.  Projectors have seen this light, this higher awareness, and know it objectively for what it is.  Though I hate to mention anything astral, let alone mental as objective--as it is
<i>
 not
</i>
--it is the only way I could describe Truth, Oneness, as someone being able to experience it firsthand.
<br>
<br>
Sure Adrian claims to know Truth, for what God is and represents--having extended him/herself to close conscious levels-- but Adrian knows only what he/she has learned from perceptive experience, and a great deal of it may actually be the absolute Truth (bits and pieces of it anyway)...  But I really think the Truth is... that there is non that can comprehend the levels of God, on that same level, for it is unfathomably, mortally impossible.  We may be able to experience and learn, firsthand, from the Universe, other dimensions, maybe even heaven.. But being human has its limits.  We just have to go with the flow, learn, moralize, and adapt.
<br>
<br>
Truth simply
<i>
 IS
</i>
. It is
<i>
 ALL
</i>
.  And I
<b>
 know
</b>
that to be true.  Therefor I know the Truth. [8]

<section>
I think the truth is accessible to everyone, but it is up to each person to stop being so materialistic, rid themselves of their ego, and open their minds. There is no way to lead someone to the truth, because we must all get there our own way, in our own order. One person may be able to figure out something faster than another, but the other person may have already figured out things the first person has not yet realized. It is my belief that God wants us to be able to figure out the truth only by ourselves with no help from anyone else- after all, IF this is a test, wouldn't that be cheating? And you know how some people are- they'd let others do the work for them. I believe this (life) is about our free will. It is the hub of the purpose. No matter what religion you believe in (applying only to religions that say we have free will or do NOT say that we don't) you are taught/given suggestions on what to do with your free will to make progress. It is what we do with it that will lead us to or away from the truth. We were given some guidelines and advice to follow by the religions of the world. The trick (or at least one of them) is finding the religion/set of guidelines that can help you the most.

Greetings What Tha Phak!
<br>
<br>
First of all, to clear up your question - I am a he [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
I would like to stress that I do not proclaim to know the truth in absolute terms, or to any significant degree, because only "God", Divine Providence knows the complete truth, and the closer a being is to "God", the "One" the "Source" of the truth, the more they will know of the complete truth. Humanity as a whole has a
<b>
 very
</b>
long way to go on the path. Earth is way behind humans existing on many more advanced planets in the Universe, indeed, I have seen that there is currently only one planet inhabited by humans in the Universe that is actually less advanced on the path than Earth.
<br>
<br>
The truth as I understand it, is the truth as taught to humanity by the wisest and most advanced Masters ever to have walked the Earth. Of course, most of the truth is still highly esoteric, because it is beyond the grasp of most people on Earth at this time. As Jesus said - "do not cast your pearls before swine", which symbolically means, so not try to force Spiritual truths upon those who cannot possibly comprehend them, and will tread them into the mud. I have studied very many esoteric sources, and I believe that ultimately, most esoteric sources, and even most ancient religious sources e.g. the Essenes and those in the Orient, agree on the truth to the extent it is known to mankind, and in particular the nature of the Universe which is an  absolutely fundamental aspect of the truth.
<br>
<br>
There is indeed only one truth, but we may only know a part of it in this stage in our evolution, nevertheless, it is still the truth as relates to the whole, as opposed to the non-truths of creed and dogma.
<br>
<br>
Now regarding Astral projection and truths - the people in the Astral are generally no more capable of teaching truths and Spiritual matters than are some people in the physical world. There are exceptions of course such as the high level Astral temples, but the vast majority of projectors find themselves in the mid-Astral, or "focus 27" in Monroe terms, which is inhabited by people who are more or less the same as they were on Earth - that is why they are in focus 27. Those that were deeply religious on Earth would find themselves in a lower level fo the Astral, the "belief system territories" or even lower depending on how bad they were on Earth. This is one problem with mediums who channel spirits - despite the Spirit wanting to be helpful or important, they really have nothing more to teach than can be found in the physical world, because they live in a copy of the physical world. It is not until they rid themselves of their gross desires, which the Astral world exists to purge, that they can move on from the Astral to the higher Mental planes, and closer to the "source" of true knowledge. I should point out that many chanelled Spirits are from the lower Astral - the sort that like Ouija boards, and can do alot more harm than good!
<br>
<br>
The main value of Astral projection for most projectors is to confirm that their is no such thing as death, but rather only a transition from gross matter to a much finer medium of vibration where life continues, albeit faced with a mind world where the Universal laws of cause and effect are faced directly.  All truth is gained by study and initiation, and that is all part of the path.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

As much as I would like to be conciously exploring other realms of existence, I'm being 'held' in this realm. -- I think that this is basically because I've got a lot to do here, in the physical realm, especially with this coming of a New Age. I'm not totally sure what my purpose will be - all I know is that I've got an important part to play. I feel like that
<i>
 this is why I have come here.
</i>
To assist and be a
<i>
 part of
</i>
this transition.
<br>
<br>
I think that AP is probably a distraction for me at this time, because the realm that I need to focus on the most, is the one right here, in front of me. So it would probably serve to detract from my work here - because I
<b>
 know
</b>
I am here on the Earth to do some serious work. I've felt for a while that I want to leave my mark on history, to acheive something big. lol  I try not to take it too seriously tho [

Well anyway, to the question at hand. Basically, I think dark forces are at work behind the U.S. government. It is no longer a democracy, after the election of Bush. Al Gore should have won - but the Supreme Court insisted Bush won.  I don't actually think that this war is about oil. I think it is about creating more fear in the world. Spreading the fear of terrorism, and war, because
<i>
 these forces control by fear.
</i>
<br>
<br>
I believe that the Iraq war will take a turn that no-one (at least, the mass concioussness) expects. I think the Middle East will explode in anger, and a great energy of destruction will move through our world. In fact, this energy of destruction has already begun it's work.
<br>
<br>
I think that is war is necessary. Not that I
<b>
 like
</b>
it or it's consequences. But rather to begin the process of the destruction of the old world, so we can bring the new world into being, or birth if you like. Obviously there are some people who will not agree with me - I understand that. But this is what I believe. I think that it's something we need to get over and done with, the sooner the better.
<br>
There needs to be a great clearing out in this world. I think the grip on the mass concioussness that these dark forces have, need to be broken before it is too late. I think humanity needs to be plunged into darkness before it can come to the light. So, I'm sorta looking forward to the next 10 years...they're gonna be tough...but they'll be worth it.

On the other posts concerning Truth and all that. [

]
<br>
Everyone is an individual - every person has their own way of seeing things. I think that Truth is, well, brought to each person in a unique form. That the Truth comes in many shades of a vibrant colour.
<br>
I sometimes find it hard to express what I feel about this - but I feel just that basically everyone is equal, and that a person's viewpoint is just as equal as the next. It's up to each person to find out what resonates with them. And this is why I have searched and studied through these things, and the things I have taken are what have resonated inside me.
<br>
<br>
But anyway - lets try and stay on topic eh? [

PS. You don't need AP to find out the truth...(altho I'm sure it wouldn't hurt [

PPS. David Icke is pretty good - he's got a website (www.davidicke.com) chock-a-block full of articles worth taking the time to read.

Oh BTW, I thought I might just attach some links to some reading material [
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
]. It took me a while to find these (probably more so that I wasn't ready to take it in).

These are a little bit old, but still very informative, imo.

site is quite worth exploring. It's got many interesting articles.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if *any* of this is true...so make your own mind up
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I personally think that there is more truth here than meets the eye.
