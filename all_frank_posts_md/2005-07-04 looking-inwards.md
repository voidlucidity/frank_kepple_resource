I have been trying phasing for a few weeks. I do the noticing exercise daily but I am confused about something. I read all of the time about LOOKING INWARDS. What exactly does that mean? It seems the more I read about Phasing the more I get confused.

dont focus on trying to get out of your body.  In the phasing model your not doing that.  I think that is the main purpose of looking inwards, simply so your not looking outwards.  During noticing make sure to not move your physical eyes.  This is my advice, now go and practice more young grasshoppa!

Hi Brad
<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about your post for a few days, and trying to see if I can find the words to describe "looking inwards".
<br>
<br>
This might sound a bit kooky, but here it is.
<br>
<br>
After you've read this, close your eyes.  You can see 2D blackness and your eyes are probably not relaxed.  You'll be aware of your computer screen in front of you and the room you are in and so on.
<br>
<br>
Now put the cupped palms of your hands over your eyes, so you block out all light.  Make sure your palms are NOT pressing on your eyelids.
<br>
<br>
You can see black, dark black.  Create yourself a smallish square within that blackness, say half the size of the expanse of black you can see.  Place this square centrally.  Actually, this works if you stare at your computer screen for a bit and then do it.
<br>
<br>
 Here's the kooky bit.
 <br>
 <br>
 Now move your mind/awareness/focus towards the square and at the same time bring the square closer to your mind.  When you feel that the square is "aligned" with where your mind is, place your entire existence into this square.  Forget about anything external to that square.  That square is you.  You are that square.
 <br>
 <br>
 That's looking inwards.  In my opinion.
 <img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 You will also need to do this without your hands over your eyes, of course.  Your body should be very relaxed and when you learn to be the square, you then will want to learn to relax your physical sight (that's another difficult one to describe), whilst still being able to observe the square.  That's when you can start noticing what's going on outside of the square.  By outside I mean just on the peripheries of your mind.
 <br>
 <br>
 Phew.  Did that make sense?
 <br>

made awesome sense to me, but may be a bit confusing for newbies.  I can see that any newbie who tries what your suggesting will understand what you mean when they experience it, thats for sure.

Sarah,

<br>
It does make sense but I am having trouble bringing it in closer but I will keep practicing. I do see 3D shapes and I can focus on them and make them clearer. I have been able to do that for quite awhile. I usually will have some sort of image flash. This morning I had a several ones. They are usually something weird and do not make sense.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,

Firstly, it sounds like you are doing really great.
<br>
<br>
I
<i>
 think
</i>
, and Frank will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
that you need to try and look beyond/behind the 3D shapes.  The image flashes that you are getting are more where you want to be.  However, in my experience, trying to look at these images makes them go *poof*, which is why the noticing exercise is good in that at teaches us to be able to watch the images without looking at them.  Whenever I get an image (say scenery), my brain shouts out, "
<i>
 Hey, hey, what's that?
 <img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
 Come on eyes, get looking at it
</i>
!" and my physical eyes ALWAYS obey my brain.
<br>
<br>
I know that over time, the images will become run-of-the-mill and I'll get so used to them, my brain will think, "
<i>
 Oh yeah, one of those again, jeez, not worth doing anything about them anymore
</i>
."  And my physical eyes WON'T look, and hey presto, I'll be able to
<u>
 observe
</u>
the image, and hopefully go onto the next step.
<br>
<br>
That's the plan anyway!
<br>

exactly where I am sarah and yes from my understanding thats right.  I do get images but I mainly tend to get what looks like grey chunks of energy travelling in repeating patterns, usually from out of my vision into my 3rd eye region.  I can watch these without moving my eyes now but im not sure how to use them to progress.  When I get images they tend to be so bold and in my face that I would have to tape my eyes down not to look at them and I have to reach out and find the image again and try to repeat the whole process over without moving my eyes.  I have had success with this but in my experience you almost have to let your eyes do what they want until they get worn out or you sort of forget about them, kind of hard to explain.
<br>
<br>
The other morning I was laying awake and was very very relaxed so I figured id try some noticing. (on a side note I love noticing!  I almost always see something now and its like a where's waldo adventure in 3d!
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
)  I started to see little blips of grey stuff and said mentally "word up grey stuff, whats shakin?  care to take me to F2?" and I focused on them and suddenly I could see a school in the distance and a seemingly endless row of small children walking 2 by 2 about 2 feet from my eyes.  I jumped a little and it went away, I wasnt expecting that!  I reached out again and I ended up being able to watch this strange school scene for about 5 mins, but not very clearly.  As soon as it took on any real depth and color my eyes would freak out.  It was like watching with foggy lenses at midnight, but still cool.  Something like this usually happens to me every time I notice and I think im on a path of good solid progress, and it sounds to me like you are too!  Keep it up and keep us posted.

Thanks for sharing this knightlight - it's good to know that I'm on the right track.  Your experience is very similar to mine and one day we'll be posting our "full" conscious experiences!!!

Monroe would call it "differential phasing" where he would phase shift from the physical but, for some seconds, he would be a bit half in the physical and half in the non-physical. In this state you get situations where your physical body will react to any non-physical stimulus. Typically, you will see a flash of an image in mind and the physical eyes try to snatch a glance, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
One of the most noticeable effects of this, I find, is with an F1/F3 overlay experience. As I make contact with someone my physical body will react to the emotional state of the person I am contacting. If the person is excited, for example, I will feel that excitement flowing through my own physical system. Conversely, if the person is emotionallyupset, my own eyes will begin to form tears. It's quite a freaky feeling at first because you observe your body displaying all the outward signs of being happy or sad or whatever, and it's out of your control. Well, I say out of my control but ultimately I can control it simply by breaking the connection. I don't want anyone thinking you become "possessed" or anything.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, when trying to reach people on the lower branches of F3, their emotional state is so screwed it takes perhaps half a dozen attempts before I can get a lock on them. The moment I try to get near my physical will be hit by overwhelming bursts of emotion. After a few attempts eventually I managed to ground the emotional energy enough to act as a kind of "sink" and that enables me to get closer and work out a way to break the construct the person had gotten themselves "trapped" in.
<br>

Yours,

Yeah, I love noticing too. I can lay back for maybe an hour just viewing all the pretty colours and scenes and allsorts. I find the focus 3 state to be very inspirational. I mentioned not so long ago that whenever I'm stuck for inspiration, I enter the focus 3 state and almost always I get what I'm trying to reach for.
<br>
<br>
Another great thing about focus 3 is once you can enter this state and remain there comfortably, it's a great launch-pad to focus 10. You simply project your focus beyond the images and think of making the "shift" and it should come about before not too long. Or, you can continue to create the overlay experience where you remain largely within the physical.
<br>
<br>
Note: at the Monroe f3 state your Primary Focus is still F1 and your individual Attention Focus is f3.
<br>
<br>
So from the f3 state you can give yourself an objective knowing of PF2 without actually switching fully within F2. You appear to be able to do this fairly readily, although you say it takes you a little by surprise and excites your physical eyes. But maybe practice this state for a while until you are completely comfortable with it, then aim to make the full transition and shift your Primary Focus fully into F2.
<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but laugh where you say, "I jumped a little and it went away, I wasnt expecting that!" Ha ha ha, the inner environment is VERY responsive if you are open to just letting the experience flow.
<br>
<br>
One of the hardest things I'm finding is trying to convince people to just simply lie back and notice what goes on within them.
<br>
<br>
Many people come back and say all they can see is blackness. But you need to forget that you have physical eyes. Here we are not looking with physical eyes. If a person were to seach around within their mind they would see some area or other that perhaps wasn't quite so black. If they were to mentally focus on that area they would see that perhaps it wasn't fixed either. It may be like a dark grey cloud, gently drifting.
<br>
<br>
As they focused their attention on that cloud they would see that in the centre, maybe, it was lighter than around the edge. As they focused in on that centre they might now see some colours, a few swirling areas of a feint redness. Whoops, suddenly they saw a flash of an image and zap, out of it they come. At which point they find themselves back fully in the physical realising, "Hey, wait a minute, I was doing it!"
<br>
<br>
At this point people typically react one of two ways. They get excited realising they can do it and their mind races of along the line of all the possibilities that can become open to them. Or they dismiss it, find an excuse as to why doing that is "not it".
<br>
<br>
People are still using phrases such as "just a dream" or "just my imagination". People say these things without realising the nature of dreams or the nature of their imagination. They are still, unfortunately, believing that dreams and imagination are "just in their heads". Instead, as they look at it, they want to have a "real" experience, or a "proper obe" while not actually realising that it is all connected and they can use the switch to PF2 as a launch-pad to doing whatever it is they want to do. Instead, they are still thinking of this "astral" as being someplace separate from themselves.
<br>

that sums up he exact stage I am at.  Its not easy!!!  All my successes so far with phasing has happened when I have awoken after maybe 5 hours of sleep and was severely drowsy and I cant help but relax into the experience.  Any other time I tend to jump slightly or at least move my eyes, but I am on my way to getting past that as noticing has really developed into a constant experience for me and something that no longer frustrates me and calls my name all day!  "charles, you know you want to do some noticing, its way more fun than work!!!"  Even in the rare circumstance that I don't see anything I just shrug it off as a freak occurrence as apposed to viewing the successes as freak occurrences when I first began.
