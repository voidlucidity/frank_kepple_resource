I was jogging two days ago in the morning listening to a Deepak Chopra CD about non locality and synchonicity.   One of the earphones was off so that I could also listen to nature.  I suddenly clearly heard a cricket noise right next me, and 2 seconds later Deepak talks about the sounds of crickets at night.

Has this happened to some of you.  Coincidences, pointers...

Hello, welcome.
<br>
<br>
I notice conicidences all the time. Such as my birthday is on the 13th, and I see that number a lot more than others.
