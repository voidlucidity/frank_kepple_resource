I have read that many people request a guide to help them achieve whatever goal they had set for themselves. I would like to know how you do this for I have never had any success in my attempts. Thanks for you input ahead of time.

hey links.  i've heard requesting to meet your guide is as easy as just requesting to meet your guide.  before you go to sleep or before you ap are the best times.  clear your mind as best you can and think or even verbally announce your desire/intent.  if you can't ap then bed time would be preferred.
<br>
<br>
your signature is a wise saying.  the wise man knows he knows nothing.  do you fully understand it?  there is what i believe is the real meaning behind it and the obvious, surface meaning that many people believe it to mean which is - to think that there is so much knowledge out there that what you do know is relatively so small that it is considered nothing.  i really don't think that's what the saying means.  i'd be more than happy to give you my take on it, or you could think about it for a while yourself.
<br>
<br>
have fun w/ your guide.

Guides are all around helping people make faster progress. Problem is, in order to make contact you have to become "open" to them. They will not in any way force themselves upon you as that would be grossly self-defeating.
<br>
<br>
With me, I used to think all talk of guides was just mystical mumbo-jumbo. (Gosh, how wrong I was there!) All that changed a while ago after a number of various Astral events. For example, every now and again I'd be having some difficulty or other and the answer of what to do just plopped into mind. Or I'd be lost in some kind of cave structure, or whatever place, and a voice would say something like, "turn to your left" and there would be the way out.
<br>
<br>
Plus, on many occasions I'd get the distinct feeling I was being followed or shadowed by someone else. Then there was the time I was floating in the 3D-blackness: I said out loud if there
<u>
 is
</u>
someone guiding me then just say hello. Next moment this voice came back, "Hello!" Which surprised me to the extent where I got zapped back to Physical.
<br>
<br>
Once I was at a place just having an ordinary conversation with a group of locals and, much to my surprise, I recognised one of the people in my vicinity as a person I'd actually been talking to at another place a few mornings before. The moment he saw me recognise him, he faded into the background.
<br>
<br>
My curiosity was aroused considerably by this and I set off on a road to discover who this person was. Although I didn't realise it so much at the time, this was the point of my becoming "open" to the idea of guides. Because, as it turned out, there
<u>
 was
</u>
a person shadowing me and giving me hints, tips, and so forth. And it did turn out to be the man I recognised.
<br>
<br>
Matters came to a head one morning after getting a distinct feeling someone was standing right by me. I just said something like, "Look, whoever you are, just make yourself known now because I'm mighty cheesed-off with all this cat and mouse nonsense." Next moment the man I had previously recognised was standing in front of me.
<br>
<br>
Meeting Harath was the turning point, for me. With his help my progress has accelerated
<u>
 considerably
</u>
to the extent where I really don't know how I coped before.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I have always wanted to meet my guide, but whenever I am out of body I always forget it.  And lately I haven't had as many OBEs as I used to.  I think there's some sort of guide always available wether on the astral or not.  Since I was young I have been asking "myself" yes/no questions.  For example  "Will it rain today?" i would grab the first word that came into my head and count it's letters.  If it was an even number of letters then it would mean yes, an odd number of letters would mean no.  And I have been doing this since I learned how to spell, I don't know where this idea came from but all the answers I get seem to be quite accurate.  I think the words may come from a  guide, or maybe my unconscious/subconscious, whatever

About the quote:  I always thought of it as being innocent.  To not interpret anything into your own knowledge to just look at everything as if you don't know what it is.  As if you have no knowledge.  Like a child.  So a new born child would be very wise.

KP, I agree about the quote. That is what I always thought it meant. To look at things as if you know nothing about it, opens your eyes to the greater truth about it. Fredhedd, what is your take on my quote? And thank you everyone that posted.

Last night I remembered to ask for my guide.  It had been so long since my last OBE that I'd forgotten the vibrations.  They were so strong and it took me a while to wonder what they were.  When I got out I looked around and everything seemed normal in my room.  I shouted out something like, "I would like to see my inner guide!"
<br>
<br>
And then I heard a woman's voice, she said she was my guide.  She said her name was Suzess and that she was my sister.  She talked for a while and showed me a few images of what she said was my past life.  I remember seeing lots of men on horses in blue uniform with weapons.  I was the only one not on a horse and at first I was scared, but they smiled and carried on.  Then I met up with someone who wasn't on a horse, wearing a white robe.  But he didn't say a lot.
<br>
I went back to talking my guide and I can't remember much of what she said but she ended it by telling me I am an ancient God!  haha
<br>
<br>
Then I lost control of the experience.
<br>
I think i'll try again tonight.  It seems all it takes is a little bit of desire and determination.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading,
<br>
God

<section>
my take on the quote - there are certain things that most everyone would say that they know for sure.  one would be ' i know i m sitting here typing this to you right now.'  the reason i feel i know this is because i can see myself doing it, hear the keys, feel my body in this chair, smell the soap on myself from the shower i just took, and taste the toothpaste still in my mouth.
<br>
<br>
anything that we think we know comes from the input our senses give us.  if the input was changed or the senses altered in a way that would change the information, then what we know would now turn into something completely different. we would then 'know' something else.  the wise man knows that he doesn't know anything to be actually taking place like most other people 'know'.  the only thing he knows for sure is that he doesn't actually know anything else to be for real.  he just perceives and acts accordingly.  we.
<br>
all that i know is i exist.  i comprehend, i feel.  i don't know that you exist.  for all i know you could be a figment of my imagination.  i guess you could say then, that there is a chance that i m talking to myself right now.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
also, earlier when i said i could tell you what my take on the quote was or you could think about it for yourself, i meant that in a 'i don't want to spoil the end of the movie for you' type way and not in a 'i know for sure and i'll tell if you can't figure it out way'.  just in case that came out the wrong way.

<section>
I personally think that my quote is something that everyone should hear atleast once in their lifetime, as it can bring different meanings to different people based on their experiences and view of the world. I don't think that their is one true meaning behind the quote. I think that it has something different to offer to everyone. I have told many people that saying and most have returned a few days or even months later and made a remark to the affect that they had begun to think about things in a new way and were thankful to have been given the opportunity to see the world the way that they are now, they are more aware of the smaller things in life that people overlook as being common and insignificant. They look at everything as if they can learn something from it, and not that they know everything about it. Every time I have a new teacher in school for the first paper they have me write I include that quote and  get some interesting response in return. Some have even become more likely to listen to students opinions, and respect us for what we have to say instead of "knowing" that they are the professor and they know all.

At one time, I have trouble exiting, so I think I might as well ask for assistance. I was just screaming in my mind then out of nowhere I feel two hand grabbing my upper arm on both side (it feels like one on each side of me instead of directly in front) and pulling me out from my body. I was startled of course and try to resist. The hand let go as quickly as I resist. The hands feel very light or etherial to me and not at all physical. I honestly don't know if it was just me generating the experience or not.
<br>
<br>
In one projection, I went into a market like place and was taken by a woman who look 'middle east' judging by her clothes. The 'market was deserted except for the two of us. She doesn't talk to me but just drag me to'show me something'. I follow her into a room. The room become dark. I can barely see the shadow of the 'objects' in the room. To make matter worse the women left me there alone. I don't know if she left me first or the room become dark first. As I panic, I come out of it.
<br>
<br>
Once in a dream directly from waking I ask for a solution to one of my problem. I try to call for guide by saying guide, guide, in my head. Then I was presented with a face. The face doesn't look glamourous at all with oriental feature. I was a little bit disappointed seeing how regular he is. He went on to say his name which I don't remember now. Then he shows me a bar graph pertaining to my matter and start explaining why one choice would be better in some way than the other. After that I wake up.
<br>
<br>
Anyone care to post their thought on this?

Terry, that is one wierd experience. I am not exactly qualified to make a good judgement on it, but I think that maybe you have a feeling that you made a poor decision, and because of it you may be somehow excluded from people that you know. Like I said, I am not the most experienced at judging things like this, so please take what I am saying with a grain of salt. It is probably not very accurate.

<section>
LS---My only advise to you regarding guides would be...ask and be open to receive. Because they are definitely there for you! We just have to be prepared because it can be quite overwhelming to some people.
<br>
<br>
My first experience with a guide took place about a year and a half ago. I asked for guidance and protection...then proceeded to relax my body with the intent of having an OBE. I then found myself in the vibrational state and exited into a tunnel. I thought wow this feels great.....then I noticed that a presence was behind me and had their arms wrapped around me in a protective manner. It wasn't a tight hug...more like I was being shielded in some way. I completely panicked...I thought...who is touching me?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
Someone is touching me...who could it be!!!!Oh my God!!! I then ended up back in my body!! I wanted to kick myself later because I asked and I received...and I bailed out!
<br>
<br>
Another experience I had took place where I was sitting up in my body and could feel someone working on my throat chakra...It was so strange...It was like they were massaging my neck...and it scared me...I then said to this presence...Oh just go ahead and take me with you...(I said it to them like I was being forced against my will!).....I then felt two hands pick me up under my arms (like you would a child) and they moved me up a few inches and then layed me back down in my body...I then opened my eyes.
<br>
<br>
So the point of telling these stories is...maybe you need to examine yourself to see if you have any fear centered around actually receiving guidance. I know in my case they have tried many different approaches because I get freaked out so easily! I feel so silly because when I am in a waking state and thinking about it...it seems like such a wonderful thing....then when they actually show up to help I get overwhelmed. All I can say is...whoever is helping me has a lot of patience!! LOL

Links Shadow,
<br>
<br>
You're implying the 2'nd exp, I presume?
<br>
<br>
Well, actually I don't know if it's really the case but what you said is somewhat true at that time. I did make a poor decision and I did become excluded (by my own doing) from people that I know.
<br>
<br>
I was having an argument with someone  in my life. I avoided her for a long time, thinking that she hates me and feeling remorse. At the time we're seperated, I keep dreaming about her and vice versa. But that was a dream and I think in the projection it is seperate matter but who can really tell?

Alig,
<br>
<br>
Ask and be open to receive is a very good advice but I have asked, receive and then freak out (much to my chagrin afterward). My exp.  does feel like being lifted like a child too.
<br>
<br>
Also Links Shadow, it might help if you try to get in contact with them in lucid dream first, just not to be so overwhelmed.

<section>
Yes Terry B, I was referring to the second experience. Also thank you for the idea of contacting a guide in a lucid dream. I would have never thought of that, but that would make it much easier to learn who they are and how they want to help.

Terry,
<br>
<br>
You were disappointed because he had oriental features or because he didnt?  When i see faces im amazed their faces.. but i guess it only makes sense some people would be disapointed they're not glamorous.  Maybe it was a person who looked like that in life?  And maybe that had something to do with the choices thing.

Goingslow,
<br>
<br>
I was disappointed not so much that he has oriental feature as that his feature is very normal like he's just a supporting cast in a movie. I was thinking (naively) about someone who look likes Merlin or something heheh. This sound kinda stupid and shallow right now...
<br>
<br>
I don't think he is someone that I've met in life, yet. Also I cannot see at this moment how he'll have any conection with that choice thing.

This happen last Saturday.
<br>
<br>
It was raining outside. I'm a little tired from waking early today. So I decide to lay down and do yoga nidra. The thunder was wild so I decide to shut down my comp just lay down and relax. My hand were both under the pillow. Then a gentle, full body vibration come over me. I decide not to do anything this time and just lay there bathing in the pleasant sensation. I was enjoying it immensely when gradually and very slowly I lose sensation of my physical and my body float on it's own accord. Still I do nothing. I thought I was going to the 3D blackness that people are talking about but actually I can see that I'm in my room in a very unusual position. My vision come very gradually. My vision is like looking from something transparent. Maybe because lack of any purpose or destination my body gradually float down into my physical.
<br>
<br>
I get the vibration  back. Like before I just decide to enjoy it. Then something interesting happens. I feel two hands are holding my hand, which is supporting my head. I was also not calling for help or anything. Heck, I don't even try to project. A bit surprised at first but I decide to go with the flow this time. The hand  slowly and gently rotate my non-physical body. I wonder why but I just let it do what it's goingto do. I feel like I'm seeing through closed eyelids but my vision were a little strange. It looks like I'm seeing fom something transparent but this time there is some small 2D opaque debris (I don't know how to explain it better) in my transparent layer.  Right now I realise that I'm seeing from 180 degree from my actual position (from my leg position). So this hand then slowly pulling me away backward (it was like when somebody were teaching you to swim). I was moving back and I feel my lower body elongate. I'm definitely free this time but I stay passive. This experience end by my focus coming back to he physical.
<br>
<br>
At that time I don't really realise why the hand pull me backward but right now I figure that maybe because  I'm lying on my bed with my head was near the wall (although physical wall can't really block you). It is interesting to note that there is no effort whatsoever.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what to believe...

  Do you think that guides are somehow assigned to the persons most appropriate for them (or vice-versa)? What I actually mean by that question is whether a guide can for example stop assisting you and leave you after you tinkle them off?

<br>
<br>
I don't think that guides are "assigned" to people, but I do think that they are naturally drawn toward certain people. What I mean is I think that their may be some divine power that leads guides to the people that they will be most effective in aiding, but I don't think that it is required that they do help. I think that every guide has the choice of helping, but I think that anyone who chooses to be a guide is their for a reason, they really want to help, and are not likely to bail when things get difficult.
