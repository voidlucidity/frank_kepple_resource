What's going on, it's not like I'm saying anything offensive, more like the flow of information is being contolled.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
You are way behind the times and this discussion has been done to the death over the past 4 weeks. We are all rather tired of it, it's old news. If you wish to know: about 6 months ago, Robert Bruce decided to open his own website and about 6 weeks ago he decided to open his own discussion forum on that website. The reasons stemmed from a personal matter, something of a disagreement it would appear, that took place between our administrator, Adrian, and Robert Bruce.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to know what Robert Bruce has to say, or his reasons for leaving or whatever, whatever, whatever, then EMAIL ROBERT BRUCE.
<br>
<br>
We all know already that Robert Bruce's discussion forum is now open. Anyone who was interested has long since earmarked the website as he had a big notice up the past month.
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce has clearly stated he no longer wishes to
<i>
 in any way
</i>
be associated with this forum. In respect of his wishes and to avoid creating any possible legal complications, we are having to remove anything on this forum that would suggest in any way an association. Therefore any direct links or direct references, etc., are having to be removed. It is inconvenient but that is what Robert Bruce has specifically stated. Again, if you have any questions at all as to Robert Bruce's motivations regarding this or his motivations regarding any other matter, then simply email Robert Bruce.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
