<section>
Last night I was reading AD about Akashic Records and something realy striked me. About 2 weeks ago I had what I call a "morning-vision". It happens often during the state when you are barely awake and have left your dreams and barely opened your eyes. Sometimes when I close my eyes again I can see this vision apear like on a screen infront of me. It can be anything from a landscape to a house or anything. And one night I could se a big bookshelf. I thought to myself "A bookshelf??? thats unusual but ok". So I stared at this bookshelf for a few seconds. And then I thought "Hey! since Im awake and I see this vision-thing. Lets do a little experimenting". I was thinking that every book usually has a title, and here a have a bunch of books and they're not real. Lets see if they have titles. And they had titles, but I could'nt read what they were. I "zoomed" in on one of the center books wich was the biggest ones and they had a golden title on them. The wierd thing was when I tried to read the title the letters changed as I read.
<br>
Lets say the first letter was a "L" I would read "L...." and then alle the other letters would change to that letter. The tittle would be like "LLLLLLLL LLL" and If the first letter was "S" then "SSSSSSSS SSS" and so on... So I gave up reading the title. And then I must have started to drift off. The last thing I remeber was opening one of the books, and I could see moving images like animations and the text would only change as I tried to read it. I think I woke up a short while after because I noticed that I had started to drift off.
<br>
Could this have been the akashic records. I did'nt ask for this to happen. It just appeard before me.

<section>
not that i'm any authority! but I think the problem with the akashik records is that peoples ideas of it seem to vary. Its of course possible that you were at the akashik records. But on the other hand what are the akashik records? are they just a method by which your mind can better portray information to you? or are they they visual manifestation of some giant collective conciousness?

I'm not an expert either but it sounds like you are on the right track.Note the books you see are Center. The books are Big. And the color Gold is in the picture as well. Gold has many higher meanings. Some of the meanings are Christ Consciousness, male consciousness, and more. The gold aura can have great power in the ability to reach toward the all knowing realm.

I have no idea if it was akashic records or not, but it had quite striking similarities to how Robert Bruce describes them. On the other hand it could just be some random vision, and that my mind was just playing tricks on me. But I doubt it since I was able to see the books in such detail and even open and look inside them. It was intresting (at least for me) anyways.

<section>
It doesn't seem random to me. It seems that you are looking for something and your inner mind is taking action on it. Yes, I believe that part of learning is being able to pick up on tricks of the mind, but this doesn't seem like a trick to me.
<br>
<br>
This sounds like a good experience, don't write it off so quickly. You may be on the beginning of a journey. I've read that getting into records may be represented by books.

<section>
I think you already know what are in the records. Your wanting to remember but it's one of the games (good games) played between or among the different levels of existence.Or maybe among the various beings of your existence.
<br>
In my dream studies I've noticed that one aspect of me is teaching another aspect of me things. My higher self  just recently was showing these other dream characters an interesting exercise. It had to do with resolving a personal problem I'm having right now. This "way" shown me was a little unsettling. Time will tell what it all means, and if it is the correct way.
<br>
Some things requires patience and reasoning. The fact you have gotten this far in your search is good enough. The rest will come I'm sure. A pattern may develop. Just my opinion.
<br>
<br>
L and the letter S may be a clue too. I'll check it out. Letters have different meanings to ponder. Though I just find it can add to the frustration at times. Patience is the best rule of thumb.
<br>
I've even been hearing a theory recently thats quite interesting. Maybe off this subject but it's about simutaneous lives.

<section>
The letters L and S were just examples I used to explain how it worked. If the letter S or L apeared or not I doubt, because when I remember most of the times there were just symbols or letters that I did'nt know, but sometimes there were normal letters I think. Its hard to remember such details. Wish I could get better at that

<section>
When you are trying to read the text and the letters start  moving and doing strange things, try not to focus on them.  Try softly gazing at the text as a whole and be totally receptive to any info that might flow into your mind.  This is an interesting method to use ,and I wonder if this method can be used to dicipher text in other languages.  Leting your higher self do the translating.  This is just an interesting theory I've been tossing around in the mind.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering text in a book is very challenging.  Try  reading ony a sentence or two,  then make a mental note that you will remember the sentence.  Finally, pick out a key word or two, "red flag them",  this helps you to reallly concentrate on the sentence and is a back up method for when you are back in the physical and are writing the text down.  If you can't remember the sentences, fall back on the keywords.  Sometimes this is enough to recall back the sentences.  This is similar to Robert's suggestions to remembering OOBEs, using key words to recall OOBEs.
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps, and is something that I have learned recently.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,

Have only just picked up on this thread, and I too have been plagued by this problem. It is caused by reading something and immediately forming a mental impression about what it is you just read.
<br>
<br>
Within the Physical we all tend to do this habitually. It stems from the fact that, whilst undergoing the normal act of reading, as we are reading we automatically form impressions about the words and sentences, on an ongoing basis.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, on the Astral there is no physical buffer between our thoughts and our circumstances. Which means as you think, so it becomes.
<br>
<br>
What happens is, you read a word and immediately a mental impression is formed as to what that word means to you. As that mental impression is formed it is released within the Astral; where it becomes a kind of fuel that goes to creating the circumstances which surround you. These circumstances can range from annoying little fluctuations where letters can jiggle around and change shape, and so forth... to full blown weird and whacky circumstances where people end up slaying dragons, being chased by vampires, having sex with 50 different partners, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
The way around it, is to simply read whatever it is, kind of "in passing". Like, your memory was merely a database. In other words, you just read and store without actually thinking anything as you read it.
<br>

<section>
I have this same problem also.  When I concentrate on the text, it jumbles around and rearranges itself.  Frank and Tracy make a lot of sense that as you process what you have read, you naturally create changes to the astral.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if you can take a mental "snapshot" or picture of it (like you have one of those jamesbond spy cameras), and then tell yourself you will remember it later (or put it into a mental "folder" for easy access).  Then later, you meditate on the contents of the document or the folder you put it in, and will or ask your higherself to reveal the contents.  In a hypnotic or hypnagogic state, this may work.
<br>
<br>
I guess that is like dumping the info into a database.  I'll have to try a couple of these techinques.  I guess it all depends on what terminology you are comfortable with.

Yes, you got it in one. Choose whatever terminology suits. But the essential thing is to take some kind of mental snapshot... then analyse it later.

Yes I agree with what y'all are saying. But then I must say I cant get any sense of all this OBE stuff. Well, like I said this was not an OBE, it was just a morning vision, but it seems to be quite relatet when it comes to the reality of it. The fluctuiasions and all. When I was watching the books I was realy "concentrating" on the titles to read letter by letter what they were coz I thought that would prevent my subconscios mind to make up anything. Thats why I was very "conscious" and focusing on em. I might (and kinda hope) Im wrong but if I didnt focus and stay conscious on the letters, my subconscious mind would have just put something there anyways wich looks like text but when looked closely at its actually nothing, and then the subconscious will take whatever the conscious mind is sugesting and puts it there instead in realtime as I m thinking it (phew...). But this also raises a question the whole reality of the astral world. But I wont even begin to think about that since I dont have that much experience and there is... well.. SO MUCH

fURIX,
<br>
I'm just curious, do you write down your experiences? I find by writing dreams and visions down solidifies them. It also seems to be a step on memory development. I've noticed in some of my dreams (probably the ones least easiest to remember) I place a marker in them (like a snapshot). In my last dream I remembered I had a pen laying on the grass in this lot. Maybe you should work toward the "intent" of recall. Talking about dreams also helps the recall of them. I like interpreting dreams. It amazes me that people will bring their dreams up to me in conversations. This didn't happen before I was "into" dreams.

Yes, writing it down does help. And I have been doing it for quite a while before I had OBEs and this vision. But still there is always holes in my memory.

I don't know if this applies or not, but this Robert Moss quote may explain some of the holes.

As of latter memory I'll claim the above statement as false dillusional and correct them as point being, letters changing as thought progress, not by letter, but by word, rather.... and being incomprihencable..   The WORDS where changing, not the letters themself entierly. The sequence of the change did at times turn letter by letter, but not entire words..... and some of them never made sence to ME... but to who ever else?

We all were in the "boubble" conciousness is God, and we are all IT. Ofcourse letters change and reality too...   We ARE GODS we just dont know it--  Our faul sosciety has been playing games on us for so long.... we are the poor few who took notice and questioned the whole game... some of us did DIE ALIVE,and came back to tell the truth.....

I've had two new experiences in the Akashic records. Before, as I wrote about in my previous posts, I would go to a main lobby area where people were checking in and out at a desk.  At one point I received the "key" and was going down an elevator to go to my records, but then I faded back to body. After that, I didn't have an astral experience for weeks. I had two astral experiences last week that got me back into things, which I won't get too involved about here. But long story short, my sister went to a psychic and they ended up talking about me. The psychic told her I've played around with astral travel long enough and it's time to make a decision about what I want to do with it (which is freaky, because I was just thinking the day before that I can go to these places but what am I supposed to DO next??). She said I have healing powers from a past life, where I was a healer in a greek temple (I've visited the greek place astrally which was weird for her to mention) and I have the power to see the future. she said I have to decide which path to take. So soon after this I had an OBE and I ended up back at the Akashic, but no more lobby for me. I went straight to my record- the hall has neon colors everywhere-red, blue, green. My record was in this jukebox looking device- the first time I saw this I didn't read anything. The next night, I went back again and I went to a computer terminal type facility with my record on it. I "printed" it out, and flew over to a different lobby area. I told them I had made my decision, that I want to see the future. We looked at my record together- which brings me to why I'm posting here- I couldn't read what it was about. It had words and phrases, but none of it made any kind of sense to me. I know the guide was explaining stuff but I don't remember what he said. I was just trying to hold my OBE that long because I didn't want to fade back to body (which I did 2x). Anyways, I did ask if I happened to write myself a man into my record to marry someday (ha!) but the guide kind of indicated that I had chosen a spirtual route. The psychic told my sister that if I chose that route, it would be a public life, and I would do something public with it, like write a book or something. So the guide then took me up to a room where other astrals were sleeping, resting. I also laid down to sleep. That was 3 nights ago- I haven't had anything happen since but I"m going to try tonight. I really would like to understand my record better. I would also like to further develop my psychic skills as the psychic indicated I could. I had a visit with a guide? type person the other night-before the psychic visit. She told me I had the "power to go much higher." Let's hope so!
