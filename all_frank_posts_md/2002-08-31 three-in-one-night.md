<br>
More retrievals and more straight-forward this time (thankfully).
<br>
<br>
Took me a while this morning to get in the mood. Awoke at around 4am as normal but it had been daylight a while before I finally left Physical. Kept asking for help and getting none, and was on the verge of getting up, when I detected a kind of whispy smokiness and Harath's face appeared smiling. I immediately thought oh no, what's he got in store.
<br>
<br>
Next thing it's like someone threw a switch and the Astral comes into view. I can feel a familiar buzz, coupled with a slight shifting, and next thing I'm in a large building. But no Harath.
<br>
<br>
I'm standing at the top of a stone staircase and there's a room just ahead with people milling around. They seemed to be visiting the place just to look at it. I got the idea it was one of those stately homes that are open to public view. So, thinking Harath would catch up with me soon, I thought I'd join in and have a look around.
<br>
<br>
Next thing I'm about 10 feet from a window. In front of the window are two adults chatting. Immediately behind them, standing on a small stone window-ledge, is a girl about 5 years of age. She looks bored and fidgety, as the adults aren't paying her any attention, and she's playing with something on the window. Then I suddenly realise, it's the window catch. I shout, "No, come down from the window!" But it was too late. The window came open and she looked right at me the instant she fell.
<br>
<br>
This was most confusing as none of the adults could see me, or the girl. Not knowing what else to do, I looked out of the open window and was surprised to see a man dressed in a blue robe, suspended in mid-air. He was carrying the girl and figured he must have caught her as she fell.
<br>
<br>
Who are you? I asked.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Don't worry about that. I'm the Helper, that was well done, now get to the lighthouse.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Er, what lighthouse. And what do you mean you are the helper, where's Harath?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 I said don't worry, you need to go to the lighthouse. Just think of the lighthouse and you'll be there.
</i>
<br>
<br>
So next thing I'm flying, there's a blur and a whirling, then daylight. I'm flying over sea and, sure enough, about a mile away over towards my left is a lighthouse. Getting closer I can see the place looks deserted and run down. At the foot of the lighthouse was a narrow landing of flat rocks, so there I came down.
<br>
<br>
It seemed like no-one was around. Then I started chuckling to myself thinking of all the possible lighthouses there are, and the slim chance that this is the right one. But walking around the lighthouse I thought I saw two figures sitting on a large rock. On getting closer, I saw they were two boys and they were sitting on the rock just looking out to sea.
<br>
<br>
"You two look like you are waiting for someone," I shouted over. They saw me and began waving. I scrambled onto the rock and they both seemed very relieved to see someone. Tears were running down their cheeks and they both had big smiles on their faces. Not really knowing what to do next, I gave each one a hand saying, "right, come on lads, it's time we had you off this rock."
<br>
<br>
The thought flashed through my mind as to what to do next. But no sooner had I thought that, I felt a sensation of drifting upwards into a multi-coloured void. Upon which the two were taken from me somehow. But the feeling came across that they were in good hands.
<br>
<br>

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Well done, mate.  As always, I enjoy hearing all your experiences, especially these retrievals.  I wonder who the "helper" was, and why you never met up with Harath?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Tisha, could you be more specific as to circumstances. I assume we are talking non-physical here.

Frank, I think I must have been "phasing" at the time without knowing it.  About 15 years ago, my then husband and I used to carpool to work.  There is an inordinate amount of roadkill on highway 70, more than I'd ever seen in my entire childhood in Minnesota, and I found it distressing.  The commute was (and still is, although I drive alone now) about 45 minutes, and in the passenger seat I used to dwell on the edge of consciousness until we arrived at work.
<br>
<br>
The "phasing" (if that's what it is) started around age 13 for me.  My mother attributed it to adolescent daydreaming.  In later years, I figured my "phasing" moments were just minor seizures (I have epilepsy).
<br>
<br>
Now, I figure, "phasing" seems so much more romantic and productive.  I think that's what I'll call it from now.

One more thing - - - I think it kind of goes without saying that I'm a menace on the road, with me "checking out" of ordinary consciousness so easily.  I have to work VERY hard at not trancing/phasing while driving long distances.  I must have angels looking out for me; I've never been in an accident.
