Ok I'm just startin out with and all the kineses or anything involving any of this...where do I begin, I tried a psi-wheel but nothing happened and I tried for almost a half-hour which is sort of discouraging. Any suggestions would be great.

I don't mean to sound picky, but half an hour!
<br>
<br>
People often practice developing their inner senses for
<u>
 years
</u>
before they start getting concrete results. Half an hour is not even scratching the surface. Half an hour a day for the next three months would be starting to get into it. This time next year maybe you would have had a some promising results.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, I wish everyone could get concrete results on their first try with anything they attempt. But that seldom happens, unfortunately.
<br>

Yours,
