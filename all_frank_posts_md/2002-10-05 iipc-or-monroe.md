Lots of interesting discussions on these two..I am a member of IIPC and have attended gateway too...for me gateway didnt work although i have enormous respect for Robert Monroe and what he achieved..it is as someone else said a bit too"touchy feeley" for me..the original "strength" has gone i feel..it is more of a corporation than anything else..but thats a bloody sight better than making bombs!!IIPC does it for me..the whole ethos is most certainly NOT guruish as Vieira has been accused of in some posts..i have met the man and he is totally down to earth and his organisation is totally down to earth...many of the volunteers take no wages whatsoever i beleive..it is , i agree, difficult to assimilate the "new language" they use..but that is peropheral..if It works i do it..and they certainly work for me..give both a try..and seewhat works for you...

I'm not here to put down one method/organization/technique over another.  However, since you bring it up, I think I relate more to Monroe's material over Viera's, and here's why.
<br>
<br>
As you've said, I've always had a problem with people who coin certain phrases for things (as is the case with IIPC).  In my mind, people do this just to say, "I originated that term."  Perhaps it wasn't done out of ego, but if not, then it only serves to mystify the process of astral travelling.
<br>
<br>
For example, it's easier for me (and many new beginners) to refer to your non-physical body as your 'astral body' instead of a 'psychosoma.'  Granted, I'm sure both schools of thought are there to accomplish the same things, but to me, one is easier than the other.
<br>
<br>
What Monroe did (which again, I personally relate to better) is that he broke everything down into Focus levels.  It's much more straightforward and structured for a logical person like me.
<br>
<br>
To each his own.....

Keep smiling,

I agree Jeff.
<br>
<br>
I respect Robert Monroe dearly, and I respect Waldo Vieira. Yet the jumble of terms and stuff seems more like a 'show,' rather than a practical deal- as if he is appealing to the scientific community- maybe trying to save face with his colleagues. It does seem to complicate things much, and DRASTICALLY more than it nees to be.
<br>
<br>
I know that many 'professionals' have had their name drawn through the mud for even TALKING about such things, so I understand why he would want to make it neo-scientific.
<br>
<br>
I am not too versed in what Vieira does, but I haven't been to Gateway either. If choosing between terminolgies and ways of looking at reality, I choose Monroe all the way.
<br>
<br>
Cheers.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>

<br>
Monroe wrote three(?)  romance- type books as where Vieira has written  two more than an thousand page treatises on multidimensionality, various litle books and currently writing an Enclyclopedia.
<br>
Monroe got involved with multidimensionality at the age of 50(?) when he had spent his hole life as an avarage business man, Vieira at the age of 9 and worked many years as a medical doctor and in charge of the brasilian spiritualist federation.
<br>
Monroe created an business which today is an commercial Institution, Vieira created an science which today continues developing in non-profitable research organizations.
<br>
The Monroe Institute has been known in the english speaking countries for at least two decades,  Projectiology treatise was published in english a few months ago.

 So, can you really compare "light-heavy weight" categories?

<br>
There is no such thing I would submit as light-heavyweight - only results and achievement.
<br>
<br>
I am not referring to either organisation, but thousands of pages of impressive sounding words does not necessarily mean you will get better results - I would say the contrary in fact.
<br>
<br>
We all have the capacity, while still in our physical life, to raise our consciousness to the Astral spheres and beyond, and to gain meaningful, and valuable experiences, and I would suggest that it can probably be summed up in a page of writing - one day I will probably do just that.
<br>
<br>
But please remember - Astral work should never be elitist or competitive, but rather something anyone can accomplish with sufficient determination..
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Daniel, "three romance-type books" you are having a laugh aren't you? Also, if I may respectfully point out, it comes across very strongly to me that you are confusing Science with Technology. The two are quite different.
<br>
<br>
There are many shrewd people out there preparing to capitalise on the (now potentially mainstream) obe-etc. market. As with all new markets, it will be a case of presenting the punter a choice of "technologies" to buy into. "Here, buy my Betamax technology, no, here, I've got a super VHS that's cheaper and just as effective." And so a whole new industry catches light.
<br>
<br>
"TMI the original and best" Now Coming To A Town Near You.
<br>
<br>
Non-profit making? Yes, only because at the moment there is no profit to be made. But it's only a matter of time before that cozy theory gets blown out of the water.
<br>
<br>
I bet you, it'll end up just like the crazy Diet market.
<br>
 <br>

Hello Adrian &amp; Frank,
<p>
</p>
<p>
 I kind of agree with you
 <img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20021116035658im_/http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif"/>
 especially on that "crazy diet market".
 <br>
 But at least I want to believe that OBE phenomenon has a  more serious base than technology or diet products. On other words, that multidimensionality until certain extend implies ethical behaviour and by so major cheatings in the OBE-market will not persist in a long time perpective.
 <br>
 (Dont tell me Im wrong).

Greetings Daniel!
<br>
<br>
The very last thing
<b>
 any
</b>
Spiritual activity requires is heavyweight marketing or commercialism. That could very easily set humanity back a very long time - why - because rather than being accepted as the vitally important thing it is, it will just be lumped in with the latest anti-ageing and slim fast products - and hair shampoos with long, impressive sounding chemical nomenclature. Or worse still - soap powders!
<br>
<br>
To me - if it looks as if it is commercial, walks as if it is commercial, and quacks as if it is commercial - then in all probability it
<b>
 is
</b>
commercial.
<br>
<br>
Both IIPC and Monroe could very easily make all of their products free, and request donations, and have fund raisers -  I wonder whether they will do so?
<br>
<br>
As for the so called Internet offers like the latest OBE technique - they won't last long IMO, because without the full study effort, people will simply not understand the significance. My concern is some really smutty sales efforts we might see from some unscrupulous people - probably spammers.
<br>
<br>
I would really like to see (or do) a completely free version of Monroe.
<br>
<br>
Still - there is plenty we can do here, and I hope we will do here - I have it firmly in mind.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I know nothing of IIPC but recently I have started the Gate Way 1 Cd's. I would say that another good source is William Buhlmans 4 Tape set, which has 5 different types of meditation and a powerfull affirmation (sleep programming tape).
<br>
<br>
Every one is different and what works for some may not work as well for others. After using Buhlmans  tapes once a day and going to sleep with the Afirmation tape along with "Astral trance" by Brain Wave Mind Voyages I was able to project, within a month.
<br>
<br>
I would rather have someone sell me a product that works, than to ask for donations at my doorstep.  I don't think their will ever be much profit in Astral Projection. About twenty years ago a girl at my school showed me Monroes Out of Body book and I laughed it off. It sounded like a load of Huey to me.
<br>
<br>
WEIRDZLY!
