<section>
Just yesterday I was walking down the street on my way to go help my brother move into his new house when I thought of a concept that I believe would be great at explaining the existence of God logically to a Skeptical person.
<br>
<br>
I haven't tried this yet, so give me your feedback:
<br>
<br>
If humans are essentially made of the same units of energy(atomic/subatomic structures etc.) as a flower or tree, wouldn't it also be true that the fundamental dynamic force behind both energies would also be the same?
<br>
<br>
At its most simple level, God is just that which ties my personal experience with that of the rest of the universe.

When you say that both of us are made of atoms and so is that tree over there, unless you are saying atoms are God it does not work for me. Or electricity is God or light is God or heat is God or whatever else like that.

Maybe you don't need to use the word God then? A unifying force that has intelligence by it's very nature doesn't need to have a moniker attached to it that causes so many people to have too many assocations with the word.
<br>
In me I can't accept "God", and most of my reasons are internal, emotional things to do with structured dogma. I could live with some other definitions perhaps, universal intelligence or something less "personal deity" like

I think that if you told that to a skeptic, they would just think of the force as something impersonal, like any other force in the universe.

I don't know how some people can make it through the world and not believe in God. Funny thing is,

<br>
Just the thought of there not being a God... I don't even think I'd see the point of taking my next breath.
<br>
But anyhow, I think, in time, God reveals Himself to all people. Some people will take a long winding path to Him, while others will take the express route. I think it's best to just leave people to their own growth, and just be the best example of a "believer" that you can be. There are those who need the experience of not believing in God in order to fulfill their unique purpose in life. If everyone were a believer perhaps we'd miss out on a great deal of experiential knowledge that we couldn't have attained otherwise. For example, maybe you need to know what it feels like to not believe in God so that, in time, you can achieve a greater appreciation for what His existence truly means.

It is equally logical to prove that god exists that way, to disprove that god exists in the same manner. Associating existance with god as a creator has little evident connection, aside from religious teachings.

Why do you wish to prove god to a skeptic, they are allowed to believe what they wish.

Thanks for the feedback,
<br>
<br>
I agree with Nostic that people each have their own path in life.  When the thought came to me it was so inspirational that I suppose to myself it seemed like it made perfect sense and to me it did. Maybe the personal epiphany that I experienced was just validating the things that Ive been thinking and feeling for the last while which is why it rang so true to me.

</i>
<br>
<br>
its funny how people can have radically different world views.. Like with Nostic for example, where now he feels he cannot understand how people go through life and NOT believe in god... i am the same but in reverse!
<br>
I started off not being sure what 'god' meant.. then went through all the standard religious definitions.. and nowadays I have discarded the term.. now I am amazed that people need this concept of 'god' (in the standard monotheistic notion) in order to get through their lives.. I have felt so much more free after i saw through this belief construct (imo)....
<br>
<br>
While there may well be intelligence behind the construction of our universe, this doesnt make me jump to the concept of 'god' in the standard sense.. in fact all this standard notion of 'god', all the capital letter stuff (eg Him, He etc)... this is all to human imo and I've never felt happy with it.
<br>
<br>
Everyone is entitled to their beliefs of course.
<br>
Interestingly.. 'non-believers' in 'god' assume that someday the 'believers' will come round to their way of thinking, while the believers, like Nostic just pointed out, assume that god will eventially make his presense felt in some way in 'non-believers' lives,  ie  they come round to the believers way of thinking.
<br>
<br>
Of course, in reality, if you take case studies of everyone, you will find that everyone varies hugely: you will get people who reject this concept and do so all their lives, just as you will get people who were once 'non-believers' who change and hold this belief to the end of their days.. in addition you will get others who vary over time and go from one end to the other.
<br>
<br>
For me I dislike the term 'god' as I find it inaccrurate, out of date and projects all the negative connotations that i feel we are trying to get away from.. as you have noticed, if i have to use it I put inverted commas round it, thus: 'god'.
<br>
<br>
Each to their own!

<section>
I just want to be clear that I have no interest in the, what you might call, standardized conception of God. I just use the name "God" because it is convenient, and it's a word that I'm used to. I have no interest in the God of religion, or Christianity, or any holy book per se.
<br>
I always found religion and church to be dull and stupid. But even though I grew-up with the nonsense, I see no reason to reject the idea of the existence of a God-like entity. I do, however, reject the religion that I grew-up with.
<br>
I do think that God is beyond all conception, but my human mind likes to think of Him as Father; Her as Mother. The idea that there could be no greater, God-like, Father/Mother-like being in existance... that's just a possibility that is truly hard for me to imagine. And I'm not sure I'd even want to exist if that were the case.

Those names all suggest different standards by which to make moral judgments and ethical decisions. So I'm curious, do you have a standard system of ethics, or do you believe everything depends on the situation?

<section>
no problem nostic...
<br>
just when you use capitals 'Him', 'He' and so on.. it just  looks very much like someone coming from  the 'bowing and scraping' definition viewpoint... also the thing about 'god showing Himself in peoples lives' line kind of smacked of that too.
<br>
<br>
Telos.
<br>
Well, the above list is concerning itself with systems of morality which use 'god' as their verifier so to speak, which is one thing I dont like.
<br>
I prefer secular ethics in the style of the Greek philosophers. Thats the way to go.. a sytem of morality that works because its a logical way for people to live together well socially... although finding the *best* system or at least the *least worst* may yet take some time.. Of the modern secualr philosophies.. i quite like Kant, although he has some problems with his theory as ever, but you could certainly live your life quite well via his system (ok apart from the 'enquiring murderer' issue!)
<br>
<br>
The only problem is, this is too much for the vast majority of the population who need something simpler..hense the 'divine command theory' which everyone can follow using the simple 'do this or god will kick your butt' routine... this is enough for most people... so i guess it serves a valid purpose for the majority.
<br>
<br>
As an aside, the one thing the religious morality crowd doesnt like to admit however, is that the biggest advances in ethics and human rights/values to occur in the past couple of hundred years have been through secular ethics... secular ethics has shaped the modern world since the enlightenment... for example, it was only through secular ethics that the notion of slavery was seriously challenged and in fact ovecome, something that christianity never managed to do.. in fact christianity actually reinforced slavery as an institution... even viewing god's relationship with his flock via the 'master/slave relationship...
<br>
ie original greek version of Pauls' epistles, he uses the term 'slave' in relation to god who is the 'dominus' (master)...
<br>
this was too strong for english translaters who changed it to 'servant' of the 'lord' which is now commanly used..
<br>
not that i think an outmoded aristocratic/autocratic model of religion really helps us in a society where democracy is our highest secular ideal... god isnt very democratic!
<br>
'Kingdom' of god?.. no thanks.

<section>
Gandalf, I also prefer ethical systems that work, as you say, "because its a logical way for people to live together well socially."
<br>
<br>
But religious ethics needn't take the form of a "because God says so!" and have validation through words in scripture, or some other garbage. Thomas Acquinas and Catholic doctrine of Natural Law are a good example. Acquinas was an avid reader of the Greeks, especially Aristotle, and it really shows. In fact, I dislike many Catholic doctrines because they are too rooted in old Greek philosophies. For instance, the transubstantiation of bread and wine into Christ's body and blood is
<i>
 heavily
</i>
dependent on Plato's theory of forms, which I see as just an artifact of the use of language.
<br>
<br>
Natural Law ethics pretty much just says that we should do what nature intended us to do. It can work outside of a theistic context with only the assumption that their is purpose in nature. For example, sexual reproductive systems exist in nature for the purpose of sexual reproduction. To use them in way that does not fulfill this purpose is unnatural and, therefore, unethical. This includes masturbation, homosexuality, and contraceptives. That is, according to Thomistic Natural Law, anyways.
<br>
<br>
But that was back when knowledge of nature was very limited. Today, we have the science of genetics, and if a "homosexual gene" is found, then homosexuals are actually acting in accordance to their physical nature. But why would something like that evolve in nature if it was contradictory to growth of life? Is there no point in nature? Do we really know anything?
<br>
<br>
I also like Kant, but add a dash of Natural Law and you get Stoicism, I think, which is almost totally forgotten in the modern age and very misunderstood (it's not emotionless!).

<section>
Telos yeah your right.... neoplatonism GREATLY influenced early christian theology.. in fact it WAS the theology... eg the whole trinity concept only developed inthe 3rd centuryAD and it was directly influcenced via neo-platonism.. and you find the early christian theologans didnt have a problem with that at all.. in fact many of them were neo-platonists that converted..
<br>
thats how christianity won over neo-platonism.. christianity absorbed all the best bits of it and enriched the rather dull simple monotheism of the original.

</i>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps a tad off-topic in my reply, but just to answer your question, when we decide to come here, let's say, we tend to create three parallel focuses. Although people can have more parallels, they would normally opt for three. Heterosexual male, heterosexual female and either a male or a female homosexual. This is the basic arrangement.
<br>
<br>
Reason being we are here, primarily, to explore our emotions and feelings concerning our sexuality. Within subjective reality there are no emotions, and there is no male and female. These are belief constructs that we have created for the purposes of our experience and we bring these constructs to life, as it were, in an objective sense, so we can experience them. There is no right way or wrong way as regards sexual orientation. We do not need to procreate for the "survival" of our "species"! It is all just a construct that we have created.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
If you define God, Allah, the Tao, and all other deities by their religious texts, they are all VERY different.
<br>
<br>
They are not the same.
<br>
<br>
The 'God' the main poster is referring to does not seem to be specifically a Christian god, so 'sinning' is irrelevant. Besides, God can't sin, sin is denying God, and he can't very well deny his own will. In the bible God does many things he commands His people not to, and provides exceptions to those rules when He favours the outcome of them breaking it.
<br>
<br>
As to the main post, I do not understand the argument. How does the fact that all things are composed of more and more similar things at greater magnification tell us that there is some kind of sentient or semi-sentient force of creation and will in this world? It makes no sense. Not a good way to convince a skeptic at all if he can't understand you.

as for as i know, everything exists because of previous causes. actually i believe that everything is the cause of everything else. think about a peice of paper. what caused this paper to come into existance? a tree, a tool to cut down the tree, a man to operate the tool. water, rain and sun, so that the tree could survive, the earth has to exist too. just think about it, evrything the man that cut down the tree expirinced in his life prior to cutting down that tree was the cause for him to cut down the tree, the peice of papers existance was caused by the invention of the tool that was used to cut the tree down, its existants was caused by the life of the person who invented the tool. it just keeps going. the amount of causes that took place to bring the peice of paper into existance is so ublievable, but its true and there is no denying it. i believe that evrything exists because i exist, and i exist because evrything else exist. the concept of god just doesnt make any sense to me.

On a related note: you don't need instant teleportation or object manifestation to be Santa, that goes against all the folklore. You need many many elves, hidden in the 'North Pole' (I assume some other-dimensional astral fortress), the ability to make Reindeer fly, the ability to control time, the ability to reshape your body to fit through chimneys, and the ability to digest amazing amounts of cookies and milk, although actually I think the time control thing would cover that, though it could cause some health problems. Imagine eating nothing but cookies and milk for a month, which is at least how long it would take him to do it with time frozen.

You need many many elves, hidden in the 'North Pole' (I assume some other-dimensional astral fortress), the ability to make Reindeer fly, the ability to control time, the ability to reshape your body to fit through chimneys, and the ability to digest amazing amounts of cookies and milk, although actually I think the time control thing would cover that, though it could cause some health problems. Imagine eating nothing but cookies and milk for a month, which is at least how long it would take him to do it with time frozen.

Well Santa obviously doesn't exist.  Even if he did our parents admit that they put those presents down there and we see them in the closets, etc.
<br>
<br>
The Dali Lama has talked about faith.  And that if you base your faith on things that you have not experienced then your faith wavers and you really don't have any.  If you have experienced God or have prayed to Jesus and he has answered then no one can convince you otherwise.  However if you just base them from other people saying so or from a book that you read your really not going to

 know
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
So basically what I am saying is the person really has to be open minded and make an attempt to look for God.  If you become stubborn and closed minded(maybe not on a conscious level but subconsciously) you'll never believe in God or be able to experience Him.

If I prayed to Jesus and thought I received some kind of reply, that would not be proof for me. The human mind is fallible, even mine. Humans are humans after all, not divine, so how can we verify what is divine and what is illusion? It is a faulty principal, having such subservience and yet the arrogance to dictate that we perceive he whom we serve, so perfectly.

I just thought I would throw in my two cents.
<br>
<br>
I personally see no reason to believe in a god. Nothing in my everyday existence would make me think that there was such a being and I am certainly not going to believe something just because it is a common belief. If nothing in your own experience leads you to believe in this supreme being, then why take another persons word for it? Believing in God out of blind faith is ignorant. Believing in anything out of blind faith is ignorant. Why not believe in Allah? or Zeus? Beliefs should come from one's own judgement, not blind faith.
<br>
Of course there is as much proof for the existence of god as there is for the absence of god so no one can say for sure.
<br>
<br>
Also, if god is this supreme, compassionate being, where is he? So many innocent people suffer all the time. Where's god?
<br>
<br>
These are just my thoughts, I mean no offense to those who believe in god.

Theres just as much proof for the existence of

as for their nonexistence.
<br>
<br>
Same kind of statement, so based only on that reason, god is equally likely to exist as those leprechauns.

My $10 says the leprechauns exist instead of god. Who wants to gamble?

When it comes down to it if someone really does NOT want to believe in God there really isn't any way to prove it.
<br>
<br>
For me I have felt God.  And it's really the only explanation that I see(to me).  How everything works in perfect harmony.  How are brains work.  And not to mention everything I have seen astral projecting(and the fact that I am able to do it).  I don't see how all that could be created from gas's and what not.
<br>
<br>
But it depends on your definition of God.  If you imagine some old white guy with a beard sitting up on a cloud seeing everything, then that might be the reason you can't believe in him.  We can't have a fixed image of him.  And when you think about it if he is so powerful and perfect how can we even conceive what he is?  Or talk about what he is like?  It's like sheep trying to describe another sheep what we look like and how our emotions are.  The capabilities just aren't there.
<br>
<br>
Oh, BTW, to MindFreak.  Allah is actually the same as God.  So is Jehovah.  And I can't remember the Jewish name for him but it's all the same God.  Basically all major religions worship the same God, they just bicker about the small stuff.

I agree it depends on your definition of the word god. Many christians do see him as a "he" and a being separate from ourselves. Some equate god with the absolute, the unmade, the unconditioned.
<br>
<br>
As for the god of the OT I could never believe in him because the OT is just an altered form of older polytheistic myths.
<br>
<br>
Also, not everyone would agree with you that they all worship the same god.

<br>
<br>
the problem here is that this comes across as a bit monotheistic-centric view. in that you are really only refering to the three middle-eastern originated monotheistic faiths, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They are all variations of each other.
<br>
<br>
however these do not represent all the worlds faiths. What about Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Sikhism, Taosim, Shintoism, never mind all the smaller faith froups like natve american, neo-pagans etc.
<br>
<br>
Although you are right *from an outside objective viewpoint*  in that all the three varients of the monotheistic faiths worship and recognise the same god,
<br>
however the woshippers of these three varients of monotheism do not really recognise the validity of each others religious practice, and in many cases even view the other's god as 'not their god'.
<br>
<br>
eg all accept the 'God' figure but many disagree about his characteristics. and Judaism does not accept jesus as son of /part of god, and christianity thinks judaism should convert to the 'updated' version. Actually islam is the most inclusive believe it or not, as it accepts the validity of both judaism and christianity (apart from the divinity of jesus), although naturally it believes that it is the latest version and therefore the correct one and encourages everyone to convert to itself.
<br>
<br>
Also although the monotheistic version of god is meant to be non-gender specific (or is that a pc name for a transvestite!) and to be non culture specific, in reality it is quite clear that perceptions of god are very much based on cultural perceptions. The islamic conception of god is very eastern, very arabic. christianity and esp. jesus is so blue eyed and aryan its unbelievable how he is portrayed in some churches. As for the genderless concept, although god is 'in theory' genderless, in reality this is completely untrue. There is absolutely no doubt about it, god is conceived of as being male, even if you dont realise your doing it most of the time.
<br>
<br>
Try it yourself, how long will it be before you say 'he' or 'him' when refering to god. now you can say this is just convention, i have heard this excuse before, but its far more than that in reality, the use of 'he' and him' psychologically means non other than your inbuilt conception of god is male. For example, just try using the female terminology instead, your mind doesnt like it, even although its the same difference, but you are just trained to conceive of god as male. The islamic god is perhaps the most male of them all. i dont think it is possible after all this time to ever drop the 'maleness' of the term 'god'; its been ingrained for far too long. You will notice many believers who will deny the 'maleness' of god, but this is due to the fact that they are SO used to thinking of god this way, they cant even see it!
<br>
It is no suprise that there is such a rise in neo-paganism, wicca and interest in hinduism and so on, as many people now, especially women, just dont connect with this male-centred view of divinity; they see this skewed vision, to the bewilderment of the devout who do not appear to understand what the fuss is about. However, once you become aware of this maleness, it is very difficult to see past it, and you do wish for a more gender balanced version that actually appeals to women directly, as well as men.

Well I didn't include Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism, etc., because IMO they aren't really religions per se but philosophies.
<br>
<br>
Yeah I was thinking about that not to long ago about how God is classified always as He and how from seeing/hearing that it's brainwashed into our heads.  For lack of a better pronoun I think referring to God as a He is okay as long as one doesn't create a fixed image of a male deity.  Because having that one tiny little fixed image of God creates a person to want to completely define God and make him static.  Then that's how we get all of this bigotry and hypocrisy saying what God is or isn't and how everyone needs to look at God this one "correct" way.
<br>
<br>
I believe in God and in Christ.  But I don't consider myself a Christian.  But I don't condemn people that don't have my same viewpoint, because my viewpoint is kind of skewed as it is.  I think if everyone religious or no was tolerant of everyone elses beliefs that it would be not an impossible thing to prove God to an atheist.
<br>
<br>
A lot of times(I am not saying all or anything like that) people disbelieve in God because of how he is represented.  It's like if I was born into this family that were very bad people but went to church and tried to cram church down my throat my immediate reaction would be to pull away.  And I would have these twisted images of who/what God really is.  Anyway I am rambling I am very tired!

<section>
I agree with you ,but the idea of 'just using 'he' as a convention but not thinking of him as 'he'  doesnt, in my view, actually work, as your everyday conception of god, providing you dont stop to think about it to much, is going to be male. I actually think that those who say they dont conceive of god as male most of the time are deceiving themselves. I think from a psychological view its pretty much impossible not to. Sure you can say that god isnt male, and this is fine in theory but what about the reality.
<br>
<br>
As for Hinduism and other forms of faith, I WOULD classify them as religions, but religions that place a high emphases on philosophy. But thats my view. I dont view religion as being only a faith system which believes in one monotheistic creator. Go to India. There you wil find that there is FAR more to hinduism than mere 'philosophies'. It is very much a full on religion, with many different aspects, not just the philosophic aspect that westerners think they are familiar with. In fact religion plays far higher a factor in peoples lives than in the west; it permeates everything. In fact to even make a distinction between everyday life and religious lfe is mistaken, they are one and the same over there.

IMO they are all religions, but it depends on how you define religion.

An (allegedly) enlightened monk said this:

What if it can be arranged for someone who does not believe in God to have to say "What was this experience I just had?" and to have the answer to this be "God."? Can this be done, so that the talking can follow the showing instead of replacing it?

I am a body plus a spirit. I understand little about how a spirit works, and a little more about how brains work. The things some feel and label as "god" do correspond to some inputs to body and spirit (so I understand why they say its god), but I think body+spirit cant tell the difference between a real god and a powerful entity pretending to be god, and many would pretend to be god. I'm sure there are some who would fool others to think they're god for fun. I would. Even if I experience things that others would call god, I dont trust any of my parts to determine if it really is god. I'd need more direct knowledge about god to think god exists. Until then, I think gods like the christian god dont exist, and gods like in buddhism might exist, or something weirder than both might exist.
