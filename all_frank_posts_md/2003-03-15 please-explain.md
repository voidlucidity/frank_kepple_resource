Frank will have to explain more fully. From what I have gathered, F23 through F27 are levels both of consciousness and areas of the astral planes. Dead people can be found there. Robert Monroe was responsible for the term focus in this context.

This material comes directly from the web site:
<br>
<br>
Focus 22 -
<br>
where humans still in the physical have partial consciousness, remembered as dreams, deliria, and patterns induced through chemicals;
<br>
<br>
Focus 23 -
<br>
inhabited by humans who have recently exited physical existence and have not adapted to such change;
<br>
<br>
Focus 25 -
<br>
the Belief System territories where those who have exited the physical are residing in a particular belief system;
<br>
<br>
Focus 27 -
<br>
the Reception Center, Way Station, or Park, designed to ease the trauma and shock of the transition out of physical reality, and to assist those there in evaluating options for their next steps in growth and development.

Robert Monroe explored human consciousness using the OBE method and labeled different areas of consciousness based on the kinds of people and the characteristics they shared.  In Focus 23 he found people who were no longer physically living who had become trapped or stuck within isolated, self-created realities after death.  You could think of these folks as having created their own dream based on beliefs and expectations about what their existence would be like after death, or based on the circumstances of death.  The people stuck in Focus 23 remain stuck until someone comes to assist them in becoming aware of other choices available to them.
<br>
<br>
Focus 24, 25, and 26 are areas of human consciousness Monroe also called the Belief System Territories.  Folks here also share the characteristic that they are no longer physically living.  They are trapped or stuck within group created realities.  For example, a religion that convinces its followers to believe that a heaven exists are in a very real way creating that heaven as a reality within the Belief System Territories.  At death those who believe that specific heaven exists, and that they deserve to go there, are the only ones who enter that heaven.  Not everyone who shares the belief in that heaven necessarily goes there, but the only people in that heaven are those who share the same belief system.  So, for example, there are no Lutherans in Catholic heaven and visa versa.  Lutherans have their own heaven created around the group held belief in the existence of that heaven which are different from the Catholic beliefs about heaven.  Same goes for hells.
<br>
<br>
The common characteristics of folks in Focus 27 are that no one forces their beliefs or will on another person.  All people "living" there are in free and open association with all others living there.  They are also all deceased.  There are many of what are called "Centers" in Focus 27.  These appear to be places of learning, healing, etc.
<br>
<br>
Any of these focus areas are open to exploration by us physically living humans.  And, by learning the Art of Retrieval we can be of service to those stuck after death, assisting them in moving to a better afterlife place, most typically moving from where ever they are to Focus 27.
<br>
<br>
I don't expect anyone to take my word for any of this.  I'm a big proponent of handing people the map of the place and suggesting you explore there yourself and come to your own conclusions.

Basically, Monroe attached labels to various states of mental focus. He was not the first person to do this, as mystics throughout the ages have labelled the various states or realms or regions. However, what Monroe did was to take a more modern-day approach in the sense that, rather than develop some mystical-sounding terminology, he simply used an arbritary series of numbers.
<br>
<br>
As you turn your mental focus more and more away from normal physical consciousness (which Monroe labelled "C1") you begin to perceive inner realities. Monroe categorised these inner realities according to their particular characteristics.
<br>
<br>
The initial focus states are perceived as more of a shift in inner awareness. The transition from Physical to Astral comes about at the Focus 21 state. Focus 22 is the first real realm where thought equals direct action. Incidentaly, Focus 22 is basically the Lucid Dream state only with a better degree of conscious control.
<br>
<br>
From there comes Focus 23 and beyond, as Mr Moen has described.
