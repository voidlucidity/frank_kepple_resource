This morning, I woke up early to run an errand and then went back to bed. I woke up to slight vibrations and felt myself dissociating as usual (happens a lot). Unfortunately, I had felt too awake and too stressed out to project. Instead, I laid in bed dissociated several inches from my body. Then, things got really weird. I started seeing sparkles floating around my room and electric like fields and they were laughing. I was in disbelief that all I had heard about spirit entities was true. There they were, floating around the room and laughing at me. I knew immediately what had happened. I had dissociated enough that I had phased into the real-time zone, but could not project completely. The last time that I phased in, I got annoyed and said 'Laugh all you want' and I then I felt a like poke on my foot. Finally, I just sat up wide-awake and everything returned to normal. This morning, I am thinking that there are only one of two possibilities. Either I am going completely crazy, or there really are spirit entities existing in a higher vibration of reality.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
There are many belief constructs surrounding "entities" and "beings" and such like. But at the end of the day they are just people, but people who live in a different environment. The real-time zone is a common area in consciousness so you'll meet other people there.
<br>
<br>
The next phase away from the physical is Focus 2, which is an individual area so here you meet all the other aspects of yourself and dwell within your own belief constructs, thoughts etc. All of which become objectively manifest all around you. This is also where you'll meet all your fears only you'll meet them in an objective sense. People who believe in devils and demons will meet devils and demons, people who fear being chased by giant alligators, will be chased by giant alligators, and so on.
<br>
<br>
Next phase from that is Focus 3. This is the Transition Area where people withdraw to initially when they "die" physically. Not that they actually die, they merely disengage physical focus on a permanent basis and adopt Focus 3 as their main focus of attention instead of Focus 1.
<br>
<br>
Focus 3 is another common area so here you'll come across millions of people, many of whom are living lives that are very physical-world like in nature. Sometimes incredibly so. Within Focus 3 you still get all the heavens and hells of the old religious and other mystical belief constructs. But more and more people are dying these days with no particular religious beliefs and these people tend to set up home and live lives that are incredibly physical-like.
<br>
<br>
Within the upper branches of Focus 3, within what are called the Exchange Territories, are towns and villages and such like, to the extent where you have to pinch yourself sometimes to remind yourself that you are within Focus 3 and not Focus 1.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

pinch yourself to prove that you're not awake. that's ironic.

Yes, this is correct.
<br>
<br>
I often become so immersed in this area of consciousness that I totally forget I am projecting as opposed to being resident there. The place is just so physical-like it's unreal at times.
<br>

Would that be dreaming? In dreams you do forget you are not really there, or does it happen after the entry to that Focus area?

<section>
i suppose you could call anything other than waking consciousness dreaming
<br>
<br>
i think it depends on how aware/lucid/conscious you are at the moment in question. we know that we are awake now because we are aware of it.
<br>
<br>
personally i only consider "dreams" to be the alice in wonderland, subconscious rising to the surface, totally out of control type dreams. im not sure where this falls into any of the models of consciousness, but maybe one day the word dream will be replaced with several more specific words describing the different states or focus areas as you call them.

Dreaming/lucid dreaming/astral projection.
<br>
<br>
They all refer to the same thing ie a level of awareness. The only difference is the *level* of awareness. Â The scale is from left to right.
<br>
<br>
They are all valid 'astral' expereriences.. you just need to work on increasing your awareness. The idea being to raise it to the extent that your awareness reaches the same level that it is now, reading this!

<section>
Next time you are lucid.. simply DEMAND more awareness.. you may get it. Another idea is to pick up a rock or other object and start examining it.. this will kick in your higher brain (mind) functions and raise your awareness.
<br>
<br>
The best way of course is to practice getting into a 'dream' state from a position of full awareness. This way you are 100%.
