   When I started at these forums in December, I was nervous, because I wanted to fit into a group of people that were more experienced than I was back then.  They most likely still are.
   <br>
   <br>
   Back then, there was no animosity towards any other at all.  Nobody was yelling, nobody was fighting.  It was great.  Finally, I had found a place online where I could help others, and others could help me.
   <br>
   <br>
   Then the bombshell hits.  A topic under the title "Ki Ball Pictures" arises.  Constant bickering takes place, and we learn that there have joined those who choose to protest against this wonderful forum.
   <br>
   <br>
   And thus, the war began.
   <br>
   <br>
   The forums became yet again a peaceful place shortly after, but what had happened was never forgotten.  The 3 had left, as they had found a better place to go in their lives.  I can recall one of them actually learning the error of his ways, and began to pursue his dreams.
   <br>
   <br>
   The glory lasted another month or two, then the fighting took up again.  People began to post of upcoming events, such as wars.  I took a part of this, and I sadly regret doing so.
   <br>
   <br>
   Although the raging battle has near ceased, a new, even greater war has begun on the Astral Pulse.  Instead of looking towards facts, we have begun turning on each other.  Instead of prodding the problem, we criticize the source of the information.  This is not the way it should be.  This great place used to be a place where I could even call a sanctuary.  It was peaceful, people were posting success stories, and it was great.  Now the future of the forums looks bleak, unless we can do something to change the present.
   <br>
   <br>
   I wrote this not to point out the problems, but to help come to a solution.  I took my time to make it as eloquent as I could with 11 years education.  I took the time to make my posts COUNT, and make my voice heard.  Now I ask that you do the same.

That's exactly what the Astral Pulse stands for and don't you ever believe different.

Well i'm a newbie i guess so i'm not really sure of any the big changes you have mentioned. I have noticed an increase in these posts about an upcoming event, whatever it may be, though. It's easy enough to ignore though. Extract the information you fancy and forget the rest. There are still plenty of useful, and helpful topics all over the place.

   Thanks for the replies guys!
   <br>
   <br>
   Yea, this was one of my longer posts.  I made it that way so I look semi-intelligent.  It worked :X
   <br>
   <br>
   I hope more people reply to mine.  Frank's 25+ topic is making me look like really small.  :p

You are a peaceful warrior.  You seek peace and understanding and everyone getting along at all times.  You are beyond your years.  Don't let anyone as you're growing into an adult ever change that, and you will grow into a fine adult.  You will run into people who are going to say hurtful things at you some times for no reason at all, but don't let it get to you or change your view in life.  You have the correct view in life, and you are way beyond your years.

Well said, Squeek.
<br>
<br>
I have been here for almost a year.  I, too, was nervous when I joined (partially because I had nothing to contribute, and that has yet to change [V]).  To this date, I still am nervous to post, again partially due to my having nothing to contribute and all the "wars" here on the forums.
<br>
<br>
I hope that there will be a more friendly atmosphere here at the forums in the nearby future.

Well, I'll lend my critical eye. Feel free to agree or disagree. I've also noticed myself doing some of this, so I'm no innocent ;)
<br>
<br>
I think one of the biggest problems going on here is that a lot of people haven't really had many spiritual experiences, but yet feel the need to post, so they end up "feeding" so to speak, on the posts of others. There's nothing wrong with that, but the dynamic of psychic energy of the forum is one of many readers taking, rather than many writers giving. Such a dynamic is destined to make any community anemic and stale without continuous fresh insight and ideas to revitalize it. Instead of taking from a post that which resonates with one's worldview, there are consistant attempts to force someone's else's worldview to bend to one's own.
<br>
<br>
What I think people should realize is that when they respond to the post of another person, especially in relation to an experience with which they are unfamiliar, they are essentially entering that person's psychic space and there is an exchange of energy. The usual rules of hospitality and curtesy apply. Both guest and host should act with honour and respect. If there is a violation of this implied contract of mutual respect and dignity, then problems arise and spread to other areas.
<br>
<br>
Then of course there are the larger aspects of a subtle group mind being created as we post from the collective thoughts and intentions of people here. No offense to anyone, but I no longer want anything to do with that collective mind. I've sensed it for a while like a lingering background field of negativity and now I feel it even stronger, like a thick blanket weighing me down. I don't want to be melodramatic, I'm just calling it as I see it from my personal experience. I'm just some guy on a messageboard posting away and if other people take stuff from it great; if not, fine.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to take a break from this place for a while and really devote myself to having genuine experiences. After that, maybe I'll come back and share them. I've learned all that I can here and if I'm not contributing new things, then I don't see the point of being here.
<br>
<br>
But that's just me
