Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I'm new to this forum, though not new to the astral and or spirituality (i am somewhat clairvoyant and have had very many dealings with spirit).
<br>
Though virtually all of my astral experiences have been through becoming aware after the split, i am busy trying to
<i>
 conciously
</i>
split and experience instead of leaving it to chance as it were.
<br>
I am excited to see there are many techniques and methods to aid me and am looking forward to sharing my experiences and also sharing yours!
<br>
I hope to learn as much as possible here and expand my conciousness and spirituality to become and be the limitless being i know i really am.
<br>
<br>
Love and light to you and our abused world,
<br>
Lunaura,
<br>
The Netherlands
<br>
See you in the ether!
