The following is a complete fabrication. But, as everyone here knows,
<i>
 thoughts are real
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I close my eyes and leave my body, drifting towards the pyramids. From the top of the Great Pyramid, I can see England! I fly there and meet a druid, dressed completely in white with a long white beard. "What year is this?" I ask him.
<br>
<br>
"5,000 BC, by your watch," he says. I look at my watch. The hands are spinning like compass needles.
<br>
<br>
"Indeed!" I say. Workers are building Stonehenge nearby. I knock them over. "Carry those rocks 100 miles, did you?" They are mad. My guide appears.
<br>
<br>
She's a tiger! She walks around and starts purring. I walk over to say hi, "uhh... guide?" She cocks her head sideways like most confused animals. "What are tomorrow's lottery numbers?" She licks her paw, and runs away. "Dammit!!!"
<br>
<br>
I summon a demon army in order to storm the Akashic records. I defile the gates, and they decay, and every book is eaten and consumed in the fiery stomachs of my minions. I merge with them before sitting at the throne of the new universal monarch. I get a headache, and flirt with madness!
<br>
<br>
I can't see. Everything is black. I'm in my bed, my eyes are closed. Slowly I open. I've woken up.
<br>
<br>
Well, it
<i>
 could've
</i>
happened.

interesting...
<br>
cute idea
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
heres some of mine:
<br>
<br>
I go to sleep,and leave my body.
<br>
when I'm out,My guide awaits me near my bed.
<br>
I greet the burning demon of darkness,and he nods.
<br>
then I go mad and my soul splits into 3 parts,and the part being me destroys the 2 others.
<br>
I then absrob my guide and head for my palace,where my servants spit on the floor in awe of my presence.
<br>
as I glide over the spotted floor,I spot a mushroom and and make mushroom tea. as I drink my tea it spills,giving life to my outstreched tendrils,sending thrills into my inferior.
<br>
The time is now,I am content...
<br>
the void is none and most be in the sun,so darkness is bright in the glasses of the night.
<br>
I ride to the vikings and greet Neptune,as he stabs himself with his cartoon.
<br>
as I glide on the plains of valhalla I spot vulcan,who makes mistakes with a son of a gun.
<br>
as I enter the sanctuary,my innards explode,and my little kitty conquers the world.
<br>
<br>
<br>
There!
<br>
I think Telos was way better than me,but I tryed

I left my body and found myself horseback riding one day and everything was going fine until the horse started bouncing out of control. I tried with all  might to hang on, but was thrown off. Just when things could not possibly get any worse, my foot became caught in the stirrup. When this happened, I fell head first to the ground, and my head continued to bounce harder and harder as the horse would not stop or even slow down. Just as I was giving up hope and thought there might be no more.... a thoughtful K-Mart manager came out and pulled the plug.

Hi,
<br>
I was wandering around the pine forest when I met a nubile young maiden who wore nothing but a thong......  oops, wrong lie.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so there I was, trying to go OBE and suddenly......  nope, not a good lie.
<br>
<br>
So the next day I decided to see if the Universe had a boundary or not, and went projecting out to find out....  that's not even a lie.
<br>
<br>
Sorry folks, I'm not good at this lying thing.
<br>
<br>
One last try.
<br>
<br>
I'm a mega-rich, materialistic kind of guy who uses everyone for my own purposes.
<br>
<br>
Hay, I did it !  Yay.

So, being able to project at will, I decided for this night's excursion I would visit Atlantis again to see how the guide-training program was going.
<br>
<br>
Night-time being the best time to project (especially if I am mentally and physically exhausted), it was dark when I evoked the Vibrations(tm) using my patented Three Angels and Ohm Method. I thought I was going to tear me apart, but being as experienced as I am, felt absolutely no fear.
<br>
<br>
I sommersaulted out of my body. It was a bit dim, so I demanded the help of the archangels, which came down straightaway in pillars of various-colored fire. They brought out their fiery swords and pried my eyes open. Now that I could see with perfect clarity, I was ready to check out Atlantis.
<br>
<br>
Being more of an in-style traveller (I mean, winking places or flying is so cliche), I summoned my Guide, Xerotosisuimianax, whom promptly flew up in the guise of an iridescent-hued Chinese dragon, clutched me in her talons, and sped me off.
<br>
<br>
On the way, I stopped by to help no less than a dozen of my friends out of body to do their newb journeying. (What can I say, I'm a saint). Anyhoo, the thing about Atlantis you have to understand is that the Titans are really strict about what outsiders they let in. Naturally, since I had on several occassions beat them in the Chi Tournament Melee Ultra, they ushered me right through the Mystic Gates. I think a few of them were trying to explain at the time to Frank why the universe was actually 16-dimensional and how thoughts only become reality as long as it isn't erotic thoughts about the opposite gender (this has to do with the fine balance of the Universe).
<br>
<br>
So, inside Atlantis, there were a class of Ancients trying to learn telekenisis, and a few of them starting to roll the dice for making doomsday callendars, while most of the others were learning how to will ouiji boards to move or taking the course on How To Recongize the Most Gullible Mediums and Why No One Believes Chimp Astronomers.
<br>
<br>
Then I got suddenly woken up. This just happens sometimes, though usually I can make my projections last for at least 5 or 6 hours.

Reality shatters into a quintillion iridescent penetrating shards of excrutiating intelligent color, biting into my green-tinged veins with a sadistic brilliance.  A ventriliquist's dummy barks madly in the corner.  I lay in a pool of purple-flecked sandy personal fluid, as my consciousness slowly weeps beside me, mourning the falling of the arches of the age of black logic.  I raise my head, and my wildly spinning yellow eyes pick up the remanants of the sunlight oozing slug-like through the fractured wall-monsters which rest complacently against each other, reaching up to an ominous white point in the finite distance above.  Crystalline mannequins flaunt their holy curves to the derisive applause of speckled Vatican robed pagan ex-Popes.  I sigh with latant remourse as I give up the ghost to the more suitable Holy Ghost waiting patiently nearby for my exhaling demise.
<br>
<br>
Woo, that was fun, someone should pay me for this.

Wow, never came across this one. This is hilarious!
<br>
<br>
So, last night I get out and I decided to look for my guides because I haven't felt their presence for a while. My instincts lead me to a beautiful enchanted forest. As I walked through the trees, I could hear the sounds of nature with beautiful bird songs, insects buzzing, crickets and frogs, the sound of the tree leaves... All of a sudden I hear distant sounds of rock music. I get closer and I start hearing voices and commotion. I make my way through thick bushes, and there it was - a bunch of weird looking creatures were having a good time. A chubby troll was drunk, rolling in the dirt, trying to sign along..."a-and nothing else matteeeeeers" with his scratchy voice. A stoned gnome was dancing out of rhythm, spinning himself and falling on the ground, while laughing at himself.  My fairy godmother was stuffing her face with chocolate cake and smoking a funny looking thin cigarette. The air smelled like skunks, although I didn't see any around. A small butterfly like fairy was flying out of balance and hitting trees and branches, holding a small bottle with a Whiskey sign on it and singing quietly "I kissed a girl and I liked it.....fa la la la la". An angel with beautiful wings was sitting quiet on the corner with a blank expression on her face wiping her nose from what looked liked a powdered sugar. A bunch of elves were playing poker and fighting that someone was caught cheating.
<br>
In complete disbelieve, I yelled "Heeeeey, what the, what is happening here, you are supposed to be watching over me, hellooooo. The music stopped and everyone froze. The gnime broke the silence and said to me "Honey, chill out, we need a break here, you are too demanding with your wishes". The troll added "Yeah, you are not our only client you know"
<br>
My fairy godmother said in a soft voice " Sweetheart, you can go to the mall and get yoursef a nice dress and shoes. It's not like you have to sew it by hand" rolling her eyes. The butterfly fairy was going "Weeeeeeeeee, la la laaaaa, bottoms up"
<br>
The angel was most concidered. She pulled out a small plastic bag with this powder thing and said "Want some?"
<br>
The elves, just looked at me and shook their heads. One of them blew me a kiss.
<br>
<br>
Then I woke up with a scream!!!!!
