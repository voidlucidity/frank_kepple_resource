Hey there

Well, a few years ago... (I'm guessing roughly about 5 years ago)... I was introduced to astral projection. I'm not sure by what means... I think perhaps someone in a chat room mentioned it. Anyhow, I started looking into the topic by typing in "Astral Projection" into google. The mysticweb website was one of the first that appeared (and I didn't know or realize at the time its cultish feel) so I clicked, surfed around, and became a member of their forums. I was naturally extremely curious about the topic, and read around the forums quite often for the months and even years following. (Luckily, I ran into other websites, including this one, before being too deeply sucked in by these people.) I noticed that whenever anyone mentioned their OBE experiences, a post always followed right after telling that person that their experience while out of body was 'meant for them,' and that if they revealed too much they would cease having any further experiences. My question to you is... Was this something just said by the folks down there at mysticweb to scare people, or has OBE research truly progressed since that time, and people no longer believe that revealing their experiences will hinder their performance at later times? A few years ago, did everyone think this way, or was it just mysticweb? I've been curious about this for quite some time.

The only danger I can think of is in talking with people who actively doubt the experiences, at least until self-confidence is sufficiently established. Otherwise, this warning just sounds like a great way to control other people.

I've never read mysticweb but I'm fairly sure the reluctance to share the experiences was/is either an attempt to appear cool or to avoid being caught embellishing one's experience. Also, some folks tend to think if it ever got out that anybody can do it, the mystery would be lost (which in my opinion would be a good thing) and the experiences would be diminished in some way.
<br>
<br>
Some people do believe their experiences are meant for them and intimately personal and certainly for some people they are exactly that.

Sharing, teaching and studying will not affect your capabillity or ability to have successfull OBEs  unless you get it into your head that it will in which case you may subconsciously sabotage your chances yourself. There is no Law of Silence the breaking of which  will get you grounded, so to speak.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This exact question came up about 18 months ago. I've been sharing all I can with people since I joined this forum and it has affected me not one iota. I have a book in the pipeline and a free newsletter starting up in a week or two so I can share my experiences even more that I do already. Anyone who would suggest that sharing experiences can damage you, or otherwise negatively affect you is quite simply wrong.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Dark-Age superstition is rife in this topic. I'm really looking forward to the day when we look back and laugh at these silly doom and gloom mongers.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

This is probably just one of many odd dogmatic beliefs that they teach, that isn't right.  It's common for people who have an NDE to be told during the experience to share it with others when they get back to the physical.  I was at MW for a little and was told the same thing.  Some people might find their techniques useful but the community seemed too much like a cult to me.
