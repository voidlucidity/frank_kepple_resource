Congratulations mate!
<br>
<br>
That's 1000 posts *as well* as dealing with all the behind-the-scenes admin.
<br>
<br>
Here's wishing you all the best.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I thought it would have happened sooner.  He was going really strong there when I first signed on, but then kinda dropped off.  Itleast he is still on the first page of the members list, which is listed by number of posts.  Unlike some of the, ahem, other moderators.

Thank you very much indeed to you and everyone!
<br>
<br>
I do like to be as involved as possible in the visible aspect of the forums, but, as Frank rightly noted, sometimes the technical and administrative work for all of these resources keeps me working behind-the-scenes instead of posting on the forums.
<br>
<br>
You can be sure however that I will continue to do both to the extent possible.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again to everyone for your much valued support!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>

<br>
<br>
I didn't realise how much work it was, until I saw the number of hours my new housemate spends on maintaining his website.
<br>
<br>
well done !
