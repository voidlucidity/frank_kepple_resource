So, I'm reading Robert Monroe's book,
<i>
 Journey Out of the Body
</i>
, and he mentions things like Locale I, Locale II, and Locale III.
<br>
<br>
So, Locale I is pretty much the Real-Time Zone, and Locale II seems to be the upper Astral...
<br>
<br>
But what exactly do you think Locale III is? I think he mentioned something about turning around in his body, and finding a hole to get there.

I read that a few years ago, it sounds like a parallel physical dimension, if you're talking about what I think you're talking about? Â Where its like he is himself, but in a different world, and he has a family, etc..??

Monroe, in his later work, does mention about how his thinking had moved on since the days of naming the states he was experiencing "Locales".
<br>
<br>
I'd put money on Locale III being somewhere in the area of what Monroe went on to label mental focus 23 through 26, not Locale II. You say he describes about finding a "hole" to get there. Consider he is speaking of a mental-hole, not a physical one. A more up-to-date description would be entering the Astral through a portal in the 3D-Blackness (the Focus 21 state).
<br>
<br>
I haven't read the book for over 20 years and no-longer have a copy. And I cannot recall the characteristics he was decribing when in Locale I or Locale II. Monroe always labelled the various states depending on the characteristics of the places and people he came across. So if you let me know some of the descriptions I'll try and cross-reference them for you.
<br>

I also remember that...I read it about 5-10 years ago. I think locale 3 was a paralell physical dimension,that had these really wide,bus-like public transit vehicles.they were much wider than the vehicles we use.I think nuclear powerwas very common, but I'm not sure.
<br>
he got there by separating from the physical,then turning his astral body over so it was facing downward.and upon doing that,a black hole would appear at the head or foot(?) of his body.he worked up the courage to go through the hole,and then entered the body of his other self.
