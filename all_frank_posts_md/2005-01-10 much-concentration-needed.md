hey you all...
<br>
<br>
i'm finding Robert Bruce's obe methods, and obe in general, takes a lot of concentration... if i dont' focus my mind wanders, and doing like whirl and stuff is like lifting weights for the mind... i'll get it though... it takes concentration and regular practice, and good relaxation and determination...

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Life in general takes quite a lot of concentration too, anything you want to make a success of takes dedication, concentration, mental effort, that kind of thing. This is no different.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
