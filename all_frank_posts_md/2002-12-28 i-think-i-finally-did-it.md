<section>
Last night after a nice little meditaitn went to bed as usual.
<br>
Around 3AM I came to with the top of my head feeling like it'd been shot with novocaine, all dull and without feeling , kinda asleep.
<br>
I got a bit confused and open my eyes. There was a green globe like light at the corner of the room. I grew a bit alarmed at this but sensing something significant was going on.
<br>
I struggled a bit and managed to sit up. THe movement continued until I was face down at the end of my bed.
<br>
I tried to slap on the lights but despite trying the lights didn't seem to work.
<br>
Fell on my face and realized I wasn't actually awake as such.
<br>
After a brief struggle to gain an upright position I woke up again.
<br>
No green light, no lights in the room, head still a bit numb.
<br>
<br>
Hot damn, I think that was an OBE. Didn't feel like a lucid dream Im used to.

More progress being made, methinks. Especially with the dullness at the top of the head. It's a sensation I have experienced but, with me, I tend to get buzzing sensations there. But whether each individual feels a numbness, or a pressure, or a vibration doesn't really matter. It's the fact that they are feeling

 something

in that region which is the important thing.

Sounds a lot like my only two "full-blown" experiences: lots of flopping around, confusion, especially the lights not working. Robert Bruce mentions in Astral Dynamics that a light switch that doesn't work (but possibly still "clicks") is a pretty good giveaway if you're looking back on your evening.

<section>
Thanks for the replies guys.
<br>
It was a buzzy-prickly-numb-crawly sensation. But like you said, Frank, it's not how it feels but that it feels. And not how you do it but that you do it.
<br>
<br>
This experience was a real morale booster since not  much has happened over the last few months except progress in developing a more efficient meditation technique.
<br>
The long quiet period was also what probably prevented me from immediately realizing what was going on. Next time will be better.

Today I experienced the first intentional peek into the RTZ.
<br>
I was doing my meditation with the intent to project. After about 15 minutes I felt the usual feeling of mental implosion and very briefly stood in the middle of the room facing the wardrobe door. Lighting conditions were conssistent as was the perspective. Some stuff seemed to be missing but that may have been due to shadows.
<br>
I snapped back immediately (less than 2-3 seconds) with a distinct feeling of first being slightly misaligned and than clicking back into place.
<br>
<br>
No noises, no weird guys in robes, just out and back in.
<br>
<br>
Yeeehhaaaa!
<br>
<br>
Keep at it people. It will happpen.

Congrats!! Looks like you had an OOBE!! Well done. Keep practicing and you will have more of them. I had my first one yesterday morning, and WOW!!!!! I didnt feel any confusing things after the seperation proccess. Which was quite the episode I may add. Terifying to say the least. After I was out I had great control over my enviroment, to a certain extent. I was in the ethereal realm when I projected, but then traveled to the astral(or what I beleive to be the astral) and met some strange people, and found a sort of........ wonderland so to speak(yup, sounds like what I have read about the astral). I have only known about AP for a couple months, but I made it sooner than most people!! I am so exited. I am going to post my expereince so I hope everyone finds it interesting. Maybe you will learn something from it. Most people I talk to expereince darkness, and confusing surroundings once they project and nothing seems to work right. Although for me, I did not find this so. It was cristal clear. More real than real if that makes any sense. I am sooooo exited!! For all you people that havent made it out I can say that practice and hard work will give results. And dont get discouraged because you will do it sometime if you keep trying I promise!!

How long? I did a stint of OBE practise 10 years ago that ended with me being too impatient. This time, I began at the time I signed up for this forum, was it Mayish 2002?
<br>
<br>
Tech details?
<br>
<br>
Hmm at first I did the NEW for about 3 months until the sensations faded and I realized all I really had to do was a gentle sweep of awareness from feet to head to get a feeling like a pressure wave following the awareness. That's the extent of specific energy work.
<br>
<br>
Meditation is a bit more difficult to describe as I spend most of my non active time (ie. not specifically concentrating on anything else) in a light meditative state. I extended the state by practising what I'd label a void-mind, could be same as still mind, quiet, whatever.
<br>
<br>
What I get after a period varying between 15 minutes to me giving up
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_wink.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_wink.gif" border=0&gt; is a sudden implosive sensation that leaves a lingering and slowly fading sharp prickly sensation. Something like when circulation gets cut to your legs but not quite so pronounced. The funny bit is that to reach this void mind, I don't actively try to stop thinking, rather I let go of thinking. very quickly my mind stills and there is no verbal thought, only fleeting memory-like sensations and thhe occasional visiontype image.
<br>
EDIT! Forgot to mention that often this state can last for an hour while feeling like a few minutes. There is no loss of awareness though so it's not that I'm falling asleep in th emiddle.
<br>
<br>
Also I've sought to locate what you guys keeep calling the 3D blackness as I figured this may be indicative of an impending state change. It now appear (3D) within 2 minnutes usually. Doesn't always stay for long, though.
<br>
<br>
As for exiting I've given up on many of the techniques described, they don't seem to work for me. But since they actually serve as points of focus an d I can concentrate, if anything, I've found that a gentle but insistent feeling of something akin to remembering vaguely of the goal to exit seems to be the way to go.
<br>
<br>
All this isn't really as exact and definitely not reliable at the moment but from the experiences I've posted before and some that have happened since I can only deduce that I'm on the right track.

I see your problem I think. You are making this wayyyyyy more complicated than it has to be. By cluttering your mind with all these different techs, you are just making you consiousness more active during projection attempts. I had this problem at first, and it was a hell of a thing to get over. Let it all go. The techs, all that you have learned. Open your mind. Let yourself be at total stillness. You must consentrate on not doing so. Clear your mind. Its hard!! You will finds that all these exersises and meditation and everything else on OOBE are meant for one thing. To quite the mind, and let the body go to sleep while you still are concious. You must be ale to move into non-verbal awareness, and you cant do this by thinking about techniuqes. You must get to the right point in projection before you can use these techs. You must stop everything until you have aquired the right state of mind, then the techs can be applied. This is just what I have learned, I have olny projected once so do not take my word for it 100% as I have next to no expereince. I can, however say that I did astral project within three months of starting out, so I must have done something right. I just dont know if I have the expereince to put it into words. This is that attempt. I hope it helped somehow!! If you need more acurate guidance feel free to PM me, I will do asm uch as I can to help. Just dont give up!!!

But I'm not cluttering. I just listed the things I've gone through to arrive where I am. They are just points of call along the way.
<br>
I don't have any technique because they are all essentially tricks to do what should just be let happen. The way I go about attempting to exit is more like zazen that it is anything else.
<br>
Just set the intent and get out of the way.
<br>
<br>
But this is not enough yet I've found. Something needs to be added or removed to make the exit reliable. I tihnk may it's just more practise to gain confidence and train the mind.

Yes, exactly. More practice. I have found that whenever I have seeked a goal, with anything I find myself cluttered with ways of reaching it. I must sort through all this info, and methods in order to simplify it to something that will work for me. In this case practice is the answer. To find the way that works. It seems you have made great progress, well done!! And intent is also important I found when I had not expereinced projection. The desire to do so. I suppose in is just as important now, as it was then. All I can say is try the 6 in the morning method. I had my second expereince this morning only two days after the first. Both times using this method. Like you said, setting the intent and going along. This is a great way of helping you to project, as it takes care of relazing the body, so you dont have to really think about it, if that is a difficulty, and also putts you in the right state of mind. You must be awake for half an hour, or until your conciousness feels totally clear. Your body should still be tires cuz you woke up so early, but your consciousness will wake up entirly.

Hi there Jouni, good to hear things are going well ! I had a similar experience a few months ago (except I saw a blue light, and couldn't move at all..ha ha.)
<br>
<br>
Like you said, it was a real morale booster ! As Monroe said somewhere, knowing is different from believing.
<br>
<br>
Anyways.....I'm still plowing on with hemi sync wave 1 focus 10 CD... I have experienced the 3d blackness 2 or 3 times now, practice makes perfect.
<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd back up Glacius comment - I reckon waking up early morning is the way forward. I just wish I had the will power for it !

Yeah, experience of something weighs more than any number of words about it.
<br>
<br>
I tried the wake-up-earlier-and-then-go-back-after-a-while thing before and it didn't seem to work. These days I get up too early anyway so at the moment the tehnique isn't viable. I'll try once things get closer to normal again.

<section>
Let me weigh in on the "OBE technique" vs. "intent and get outta the way" controversy.  If you can call it a controversy.  I have a feeling that sometimes the newbies get confused about the variety of conflicting advice.
<br>
<br>
There are a lot of OBE techniques out there.  From EXPERIENCE (always look for experience in an advice-giver) I've found that many "techniques" (pick one of a thousand!) are good mental workouts and important not only to the OBE experience in general, but also important to the quality of your OBE experience once you GET to the astral.
<br>
<br>
However, "techniques" don't necessarily lead directly to an OBE.
<br>
To actually HAVE an OBE, you have to put out the intent and get out of your own way!
<br>
<br>
So definitely do the meditation, the NEW, the chakra work, the mental excercises - - - - do them one or do them all, but KEEP DOING THEM and your brain and energy bubble will be strong and toned and ready.  But at some point, to OBE, you're gonna have to just flop.  And throw out the intent.  And wait . . . fully aware.
<br>
<br>
It takes patience, and a whole lot of failed attempts, but if you keep it up, some day, WHOOP!  Out you'll go.  So, be careful what you wish for . . . . . . .[

<section>
Hmm, maybe I got a bit misread back there
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
The long list of things was just a list of things I've done in the past in order to develop a better degree of control over my mind. So I fell into the technique trap when I first had a go some 15 years ago and failed.
<br>
This time I have no technique to speak of. Well, maybe you could call it the Nike-method. The slogan for them was (maybe is) "Just Do It"
<br>
<br>
At the moment I do the meditation for two distinct purposes. One is to learn about myself and my relaitonship with the surrounding world. The other is to provide absolute priority to the intent of having an OBE. I believe the more prominent the intent is with regard to everything else going on in one's mind the better that chance of success. And the recent experiences, short though, seem to prove the assumption.
<br>
<br>
Without being a seasoned OBEr I can safely say that the "getting out of the way" is pretty much the only thing necessary. The trick, and the underlying goal of alll the various methods, is to distract the conscious mind enough to let the OBE happen. The same can be accomplished by unlearning or overriding the blocks in our psyche that stand in the way of success.
<br>
<br>
For most things in our lives the journey is more important the the destination but in learning to get OB the journey can mislead you. It's iimportant not to get bogged down in the details of doing.
<br>

Way to go! I love reading these - don't now how I missed yours before.
<br>
<br>
About different techniques, and the idea that if we just get good enough we'll be able to produce this sort of thing more often....like we're making a personal recipe....
<br>
<br>
I keep finding that it changes. What works, what doesn't, what practices lead to what sensation, etc etc etc.  Waking up mid-night used to work great. Naps used to be a prime time for projecting.
<br>
<br>
Now, not so much. My sleep has changed. other things work. I don't think i have advanced necessarily, but my opinion as a result of the ongoing changes is that ya gotta go with the flow.
<br>
<br>
jouni, this is so cool. I will definitely stay tuned.

It seems there is a downside to having a more or less successful experience. After the one's described earlier in this thread I've noticed that I keep anticipating reaching the waypoints before astral. And boy does this undermine the entire process.
<br>
So I'll have to learn not to care and not to expect anything until I emerge in the astral. This is getting more and more zen-like. You can do it once by chance, twice by effort but consistently only by nor trying but jumping into the river and going with the flow.
<br>
<br>
But any OBE's aside I'm still gaining a lot of knowledge about myself so the OBE is becoming more a by product than a goal in itself. Which, I think is exactly the way to go.
