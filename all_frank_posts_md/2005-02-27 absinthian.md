Hello I'm Absinthian from Holland. Since I can read and write I've been reading everything I could find about;magic, astronomy,UFO,occult things,and so on. I've had a few UFO sitings when I was a child, and got a few obe's. Just recently I picked up this study again because of a powerful obe experience. I hope to learn a lot more on this forum, and I hope that you can understand my English.

<section>
btw just got a bottle of absinth from a friend, brought it back from Prague... 'Staroplezenecky' dont know if you heard of it.. original bohemian recipe as endorsed by Napoleon!.... 70% proof!
<br>
<br>
Have'nt tried it yet... used to be illegal in UK but although you can now buy it in supermarkets it is watered down wuss absinth.. only about 40% or so..
<br>
In order to buy in full strengh real stuff you have to by it from abroad.
<br>
<br>
I've heard it can give you visions but dont know if thats true or not.. mind you at 70% I'm not suprised!
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll try some at the weekend!
<br>
<br>

<section>
Good luck Gandalf. 70 percent is pretty heavy stuff. By the way, I heard you need to consume it with some sugar. The plant (artemissia absinthium) is said to induce visions, and same plant is used in an insence which causes apperetions to appear in the physical.

Oh my god, Gandalf, be careful.
<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting quote from the book Pharmako/poeia by Dale Pendell:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects
<br>
<br>
After the first glass you see thigns as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and this is the most horrible thing in the world. --Oscar Wilde (in Conrad 1988)
<br>
<br>
<br>
One glass is very wonderful! I've done three. Haven't had absinthe (watered down kind) since...

Welcome to the forums and I hope you enjoy it here.
<br>
<br>
I think I'll decide to stay out of the whole drug and alcohol testing ideas, though. You guys feel free to experiment though and let us know what happens.
