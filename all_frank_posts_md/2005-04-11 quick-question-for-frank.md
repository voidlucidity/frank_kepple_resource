Frank, I've just started practicing AP, havent had one yet but I am making progress. Ive been reading this forum like the bible and its really helped me, especially the way you explain things. Anyway, heres my Q:
<br>
<br>
You say "Problem is, F2 is essentially your imagination. So anything you think automatically comes about all around you. This is darned inconvenient and confusing for a large majority of people. But it is perhaps the easiest non-physical state to Phase into, which is the plus side. "
<br>
<br>
But what I want to know is you are saying it like its a bad thing to go into F2 and just have fun with your imagination. Is there any negatives to just projecting into F2 for a fun time, like if i wanted to re-enact the dojo scene from the matrix for example. Ive seen you say on other threads that for 5 years you were "stuck" in F2 but is it really all that bad? sounds like alot of fun to me but what im getting from you is that if your looking to do some "real" astral work, you need to get past F2oC. But for those of us that are just starting this whole AP thing, wouldnt F2 be a good place to sort of hone our skills and just have a little fun?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
Ben

Hi:
<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong in focusing within this region provided you know the basic ground rules. People are getting far more knowledgeable now, but people in the past have projected into this region and met with all manner of devils, demons, scary circumstances, and that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, these people have not realised exactly where they were at in the general scheme of things. They have mistakenly thought they were actually "travelling" to some weird and whacky place where all kinds of nasty things would take place. But all they were doing was meeting with the objective representations of their own fears.
<br>
<br>
Myself, I spent almost 5 years projecting to this region not knowing where the heck I was. I too thought I was in some weird and whacky place. I worked it out eventually. But in doing so I battled with every kind of demon I could imagine, fought in countless wars and slayed dragons galore! Then, one morning, the penny dropped.
<br>
<br>
So by all means go and have a "play".
<br>
<br>
Whatever you can imagine, you can experience. But the key word here is "whatever". I mean that
<i>
 literally
</i>
. You actually experience it as clear and as lifelike as if it were an actual physical circumstance. So your mind can get a little freaked out if you take it too far. But provided you know exactly where you are, i.e. within the realms of your imagination, and that thought equals action, then you should have no problems.
<br>
<br>
I just wouldn't get too frivolous with it. You need to treat the energies involved with a little respect as they can be highly influencing. Ha ha, it can be quite addictive too.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
YOu spoke about demons and bad creatures: are they just a product Â of your imagination? are they demons indeed (i mean, they exist even if you dont project).
<br>
<br>
Can you make them disapear?
<br>
<br>
thanks

In F2oC everything is your imagination.
<br>
<br>
Once you move past that into F3 and F4 you meet "independent" entities. Even so, they are harmless.

I guess I'm behind the times on this subject. I know it has been disccused repeatedly. However, this is the first time it's been explained in a manner that makes sense, and I happened to be reading.
<br>
<br>
How do you go beyond F2? References to previously expecially helpful threads would suffice if it takes too long to explain yet again.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.
