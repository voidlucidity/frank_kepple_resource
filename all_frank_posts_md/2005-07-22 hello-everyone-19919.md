<section>
I have been registered here for over a month but this is my first time to post anything.  I do not usually participate in public forums but this seemed like such an interesting group of people that I decided to join in.
<br>
<br>
I am 59 years old and live in the mountains of northern Arizona in the US.  I have been interested in "astral projection" for most of my life and have read many books on the subject, including all of Robert Monroe's books.  At several different times I have practiced different techniques in an attempt to learn how to "leave my body" but without success.  I did have one spontaneous OBE in 1974 where I found myself floating above my body near the ceiling while I was laying on the bed.  When I saw my body laying there it scared me so bad that I re-entered my body very quickly with a feeling of an electrical shock.  I eventually got discouraged about being able to project under my own control and gave up trying.
<br>
<br>
I have been reading on this forum for a couple of months now and have found a lot of very interesting information.  I was particularly fascinated by some of the articles by Frank and his phasing approach.  I got the feeling that maybe I could learn to do this after all and I have joined his virtual classroom.  I now feel sort of like a blind person who sees the possibility that he may soon be able to see.  I have spent most of my life with no conscious awareness of the "greater reality" and am hopeful that that may be about to change.
<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to sharing experiences and participating on this forum with all of you.
<br>
<br>
Rick

Hi rick,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the AP forum from another Flagstaff resident.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for the introduction too. The Bruce model never really worked for me. My success has been with
<i>
 phasing
</i>
and that's largely due to utilyzing the methods written by another moderator here, Frank, whom you've mentioned in your introduction.
<br>
<br>
Again welcome. We'll look forward to your involvement here.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick
