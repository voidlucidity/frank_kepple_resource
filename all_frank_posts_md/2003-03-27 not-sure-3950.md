I was recently admitted to hospital with a problem with my small intestine (still here, am using the patient library internet connection).  I was asleep, but i do rememeber having a "dream" where i was walking down the corridors of the ward, looking around, don't rememeber much detail but the hallways themselves, somethings were different.  Just wondering if you people think it might be a dream or an OBE, what do ya think?

Hey, Quant.
<br>
<br>
Can you remember how did you feel? Were you groggy, or was your full awarness present? You say the hallways looked different? Can you describe how different? It's hard to come to some conclusion without more information.

Well, i think when i was walking down the corridors the world seemed, boxed in, as if the world was normal, but the outside was a mist, an unknown...
<br>
<br>
I just didn't notice every detail when i was walking down there, that was the difference...

Were you aware that you are dreaming, or possibly OBEing?

I was aware when i thought about what i had done, you know, it was like, i was aware when i was walking there, but had forgotten, and rememebered when i was actually walking there when i got up out of bed.

Well, then it is most likely a dream. But don't worry, whatever mehtod you are using is working, 'cause dreams obout OBE show that your mind is being saturated towards the goal, and that is having a OBE. Next time when you get lucid in a dream, try to mentaly ask to have an OBE. If your demand is strong enough, you could be awakened by vibrations, or dream will simply melt away and you will be "out".
<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that you are very close. Just keep going. Be persistent. Trust me, you will see that you're efforts have not been in vain once it happens to you. You can mail me if you need some more advice.
<br>
<br>
Good luck to you,
<br>

This is what I call Hindsight Realisation and it's very common in the early stages. Either you remember snippets upon waking or some Physical circumstance can come about during the course of your normal Physical day that can act as a trigger: where suddenly an image of you being (for want of a better phrase) out-of-body comes flooding into mind.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, what we call dreams are actually Astral Projections. The only real difference between a dream, and an Astral Projection, is your level of conscious awareness and your degree of conscious control. Which is why it is perfectly possible (as Pan also rightly points out) to "wake up" within a normal dream and convert the experience to an Astral Projection. What converts the experience is the act of you becoming more aware and taking control of your thoughts.
<br>
<br>
The Astral environment is a region where Thought equals Direct Action. So one of the basic keys to exploring the Astral realms productively (as opposed to flitting about here, there and everywhere) is having a high degree of conscious control over your thoughts-release-emotions.
