<section>
AP Friends,
<br>
<br>
Just recently I had six astral projections and in the last projection I had the opportunity to talk with this girl. I asked her name and she replied back and then asked me if I had any brothers or sisters. As I was getting ready to answer her I lost consciousness and returned back to my physical body.
<br>
<br>
I wish that I was able to communicate with her more and just get to know her and what she was about etc. The only thing that I did pickup before approaching her (Flying up to her). That it appeared to possible be amish, possible 20th Century clothing. Along with her was another girl and she didn't take too kind of me and left. They both were sitting on a wooden bridge with rope to hold balance and steps.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone here have had lengthy discussions with people, entities, angels, in the astral? Have you been ever able to verify upon return to the physical that they once existed here on earth.
<br>
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
As regards people, yes, I have managed to make a number of verifications of people I met within Focus 3 of consciousness of my Phasing Model. This relates to focuses 23 to 27 inclusive of the Monroe model or the "Afterlife" region of the Bruce Moen approach.
<br>
<br>
Having said that, you cannot always speak to people and get verifiable information. I was speaking just yesterday to a very interesting lady called Mary who had built herself a wooden church and was waiting for "god" to come and bless it for her. You cannot help but have compassion for these people. She had held her faith all her life that one day she would be meeting "god" after she died and there she was, waiting for "him".
<br>
<br>
She asked me if I was waiting for god too, and if I was lost. I said I was a traveller passing through (as I do). She invited me in and offered to share what she had. Saying if I was lost then I could stay in her little place while waiting for "him" and he would bless me as "he" would her. Once I was "blessed" then off I'd go to "heaven" and all that jazz. I gave her my thanks and, once I was out of sight, Phased back to physical to make notes.
<br>
<br>
There are no easy answers to these kinds of situations.
<br>
<br>
To people who have never experienced Focus 3 of consciousness all tends to be cut and dried. A bit black and white you could say. But 99.99% of the time, you come across situations that there are no real answers to. But occasionally, very occasionally, you get this little nugget of info you can check and it becomes real. And the first time that happens to you, you will have a big silly grin on your face for weeks.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey Skydust and Frank,
<br>
<br>
The woman who I spoke with I did ask her name two times to make sure that I got it right. The name was "Tiarek Muhefah pronounced Te-air-rick Moo-ee-ah-fa" and she appeared to be amish or the clothes that woman worn in the late 19th century. She was in her early 20's, brown eyes, light brown hair, very beautiful, slender and a very nice bod. She didn't wear any makeup or jewelry. She was silent and had a nice tone to her. I do feel that if I could have talked with her more it would been beautiful.
<br>
<br>
Just last Monday I ran across a man who I was walk in with hold hands, he told me that his wife murdered him. His name was Bobby and was at least in his mid 40's. During our conversation I told him sorry to hear that he was deceased and I would pray for him. My consciousness was terrible at that moment and I struggled to maintain it by pulling on my eyelids to keep them open so I could keep the contact - but lost it.

Frank,
<br>
<br>
What seems to work for you when gathering information from people that you meet in the astral?
<br>
<br>
Would you think that these people are trying to play around with you, make it a guessing game or what?
<br>
<br>
What do you suggest sir?
<br>

I've met an Angel when I was 4 years old. I regularly visited a small park where a large hill sloped down to a valley where a stream flowed through. I went down to play by the river (stream) which I had never done before. There was a small wooden foot bridge and the water was swirling in eddies. A man about the age of 85-90 was across the stream. He told me to leave this area and not to play here because it was dangerous. He also told me this is not my time. I said ok and turned to leave. I took one step and then turned around to say goodbye, When I did, he disappeared. I do remember that he had a beautiful whitish yellow glow around him, but he looked as just an old man.
