Hey Gang..

New member - lots of questions, but I wanted to start off with this one first.
<br>
<br>
I began a pretty strenuous weightlifting program about 6 months ago.  I've been very faithful to it, and I plan to continue with it.  As a result, I noticed with interest the comments about relaxing the body in the opening tutorials.
<br>
<br>
If your muscles are slightly sore, pumped, fatigued, etc.. is this a hindrance to astral projection - a possible benefit - or does it make any difference?
<br>
<br>
Thanks!

Hi J.K.
<br>
<br>
It's much easier for me to relax my muscles completely after a good workout.
<br>
<br>
Good high protein after workout meal + relaxation/meditation = maximum regeneration = GROWTH

Hi JK
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum! Personally, I find it easier to project after exercise. I  make  my projection attempts in the afternoon, and my success rate is higher if I`ve been physically active during the day.I like that healthy glow you get after a workout and a tuned  body contributes to a peaceful state of mind.Turning your attention towards the non-physical will make those aches and pains dissapear.
<br>
<br>
Happy Trails

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I enjoy a spot of weight training, nothing serious or competitive but more of a personal goal thing. It was something I started years ago for a bit of a laugh and found I enjoyed it, so I used to "pump iron" twice a week. I can't say that I've found my training interferes with my inner work and I can't say whether it helps either. Mental discipline obviously comes into it a lot at the more competitive end of any sport but , as I say, I'm nowhere near that so it doesn't really come into it in my case.
<br>
<br>
I had a bit of a layoff the past year due to other events in my life having to take priority, so both my body-weight and my strength has dropped. Before the layoff I was lifting 1RM 230; 270 and 375 (bench, squat, deadlift, and in pounds not kilos! I wish, lol). These lifts I realise are nothing compared to what guys are doing on a regular basis, but I felt good about them, though I doubt I could bench even 200lbs now. I've been working on getting back into it. The past couple of months I've been making changes to my diet, upping my food intake and gradually raising my body-fat percentage. I'm aiming for around 12% (up from about 7-8%); which I find ideal when in a training regime, as it helps soften muscles therefore making them more flexible and less susceptible to injury.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes in spot-training a particular body-part, I'd get an incredible pump that just wouldn't go away for ages, and then maybe a little soreness after that, which would last for about a day. But if you are experiencing actual soreness on a regular basis then I would take this as a
<u>
 sure
</u>
sign of overtraining, and to cut back. I would always take at least a one or two week layoff every four weeks just to allow everything to restore fully.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey Frank..
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the added info.  Luckily, I'm sorta past the point of soreness.  Some days I might experience a little after training exceptionally hard, but it's never to the point of pain.  Just a little tightness.
<br>
<br>
I just didn't want to spend a long time working on this only to find out that I'd been shooting myself in the foot.
<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be the first time I'd done something like that..

Actually, I can't recall exactly where I read this; but the statement was in order of "A fitter physical body reflects a fitter energetic body" in the sense that it is easier (ie: less blockages) than someone who may not be.  perhaps this has something to do with the fact that you think about your body's various parts a little more than someone who doesn't work out that much and that's more or less the basis for energy work.

Hey Legend....  Thanks - and it seems that would make sense.  In fact, I've started mixing some of the energy and breathing exercises I learned about on this site in with my routine the other day.
<br>
<br>
As I was on the Stairmaster though, and breathing in all that sparkling light, I couldn't help but kinda laugh at myself knowing that nobody there realized what I was doin..
