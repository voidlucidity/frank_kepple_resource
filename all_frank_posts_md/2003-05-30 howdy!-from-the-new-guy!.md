<br>
I've had a few OBE's in my life,and I am reading "Astral Dynamics" for the first time,so I hope soon have some more!
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be part of this discussion group.

Hi Skip,
<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you, I'm Jeni. By the sound of your username, I thought you worked in television (A chyron operator is someone who puts the title bars, as well as the graphics on screen at a television station).
<br>
<br>
I did some radio back in college and would like to get back into it again, even if only for fun.
<br>
<br>
Take care and nice meeting you,
