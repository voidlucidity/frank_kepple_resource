Hey, I thought this was kind of fun and interesting- I don't know how accurate it is, but go try it out and then post your results here as a reply (just copy and paste the results over here).
<br>
<br>
The test can be found at:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://users.rcn.com/zang.interport/personality.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://users.rcn.com/zang.interport/personality.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
My results:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Peaceful
<br>
Discreet
<br>
Non-Aggressive
<br>
<br>
<br>
You are easy-going yet discreet. You make friends effortlessly, yet enjoy your privacy and independence. You like to get away from it all and be alone from time to time to contemplate the meaning of life and enjoy yourself. You need space, so you escape to beautiful hideaways, but you are not a loner. You are at peace with yourself and the world, and you appreciate life and what this world has to offer.

You come to grips more frequently and thoroughly with yourself and your environment than do most people. You detest superficiality; you'd rather be alone than have to suffer through small talk. But your relationships with your friends are very strong, which gives you the inner tranquility and harmony that you require. You do not mind being alone for extended periods of time; you rarely become bored.

Tried the link Patty supplied and I got:
<br>
<br>
You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realization of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that 'True love is just around the corner' and - if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will.
<br>
<br>
You are working extremely hard trying to improve your image in the eyes of others. You are looking for acknowledgement from your peers and those who come into your sphere of influence. You want to be liked, not for what people think of you but for what you really are..... Click here to see more!
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLUE personalities are the most creative and artistic of all of the colors. Imagination is your middle name and you love to express your mind freely. You are a true visionary who usually makes your dreams come true!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, now pass me the sick bucket.

Independent
<br>
Unconventional
<br>
Unfettered
<br>
<br>
You demand a free and unattached life for yourself that allows you to determine your own course. You have an artistic bent in your work or leisure activities. Your urge for freedom sometimes causes you to do exactly the opposite of what expected of you.
<br>
<br>
Your lifestyle is highly individualistic. You would never blindly imitate what is "in"; on the contrary, you seek to live according to your own ideas and convictions, even if this means swimming against the tide

Given the design that's associated with it, I'm not all together surprised that the majority of people from an OBE study site would pick that.

<section>
Do you really think that one design looks like the "grid" in the astral?
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think it's obvious that while one image might give a small hint to one's personality, it's not going to indicate what kind of personality someone truly has- no test probably can.  I am going to look for another test, one that asks a series of questions or something.  This has, however, been interesting.
