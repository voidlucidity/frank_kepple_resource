<section>
I recently came accross some information regarding something called "Outsourcing".  The individual proponing this idea used the term to describe accessing and interacting with the higher astral/mental planes in order to acquire new knowledge and gain positive experiences (contact with higher self).  Nothing new hear for most of us, even those you aren't seasoned travellers understand that in the higher levels one can attain a great deal of positive experiences.
<br>
<br>
The interesting thing I came accross was that some of these higher planes seem to have specific and meaningful colors associated with them.  In brief: Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.
<br>
<br>
Violet- spiritual enlightenment/"actualization (I know that is broad, but this is a VERY basic explanation)
<br>
<br>
Blue- balance/"attuning"
<br>
<br>
Green- healing
<br>
<br>
Yellow- learning/knowledge
<br>
<br>
Orange- motivate/nurture
<br>
<br>
Red- I can't remember
<br>
<br>
<br>
Can anyone add anything to this?  Has anyone had any personal experiences regarding color association?

I assume no one has had any experience with, or read anything about this- I find that to be very interesting.  When no one has anything to say about a topic I guess it can only mean two things: the topic is completely boring and unimportant or it's a great question for no one seems to have any ready answer.

Daniel, I'm really not too clued up on all of this. But Mobius has a post to another thread where he talked about different colours being associated with various areas of the body. Which is something I, myself, am only just trying to get to grips with.

Daniel, my exhaustive research on colors/energy/harmonics and how they all interact tell me what you say makes sense. If you EVER investigate the number seven, you'll very quickly realize that seven appears almost everywhere in our universe...seven planes of existence, seven chakras, seven colors of the rainbow, seven notes in a musical scale, I could continue ad infinitum. I already know of a relationship between the seven colors of the rainbow, the seven chakras, and the seven notes of a musical scale/or first seven harmonics.
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce also wrote in AD that colors correspond to the planes, like blue for astral. In the 'buffer zones' between planes, it's a void with a 'haze' of the corresponding color.
<br>
<br>
So what you say makes sense to me!

Thanks for the info fellas.  I didn't know Bruce talked about any color coordination-- I am going to have to check out what he said about it.
<br>
<br>
About the number seven, that's my favorite number and has been since I was a child...it makes me very happy to know that it is a special number because, you know, we all want to feel special!  (smile)
<br>
<br>
Thanks again...
