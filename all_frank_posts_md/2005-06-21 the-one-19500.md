<section>
This was one of my all time most important OBE experiences I've ever had.
<br>
<br>
Before I had it, I had finally realized how to stay positive, very positive and my energy had turned warm and full of color. I was prepared to have a cosmic adventure.
<br>
<br>
Here I am drifting off to sleep, where I often have OBEs by accident. If I just lay on my back, my eyes just start to roll and I start falling into my bed, then I sometimes see demons, sometimes I see other things. Ive had quite a few remarkable experiences I wouldn't mind sharing.
<br>
<br>
This one was different. Here I was, in my OBE, floating nicely, and then I ask myself, so what do you want to do?  I said "I want to do the best thing possible" Just as I say this, my wish becomes my command. I start feeling this huge energy coming out of me, and it just grows and grows. This is absolutely amazing, It is like a drug trip more intense than any other I've ever imagined. I'm sitting in a room, that had a table and a few chairs, very simple and I am almost stumbling my - this buzzing is so intense I literally see the light...
<br>
<br>
I'm sitting, in a room, almost incapacitated because its so intense. So  I go to roll myself a joint, just in case the experience gets to be too much and I can't handle it. This is noticeably difficult as I am coming up on whatever this was. I finally rolled it, stuck it in my pocket, and I was safe.  During this whole time I was with another person who appeared to be a friend. Not one that I knew, but his energy was complacent with mine he was assistance during the experience.
<br>
<br>
Time flashes, I start wondering - feeling so light "what is happening?!"
<br>
Then as if like in a movie  my spirit rises up and my body crouches down in the fetal position. - I had never felt a buzz like this in my life, it was so magical and amazing. I could've cried from its awesomeness. There was no words, just acknowledgment... Earlier there was some frazzled chit chat but nothing too spectacular the experience was one of high place.
<br>
<br>
Then it happened. I was there peaceful as I could be. I was told something right there....
<br>
<br>
Someone asked me,  timidly, "who are you" and I replied "I am one" It was as if I was an angel or something and that my spirit manifested itself as a vision to the other person.  He then asked me, "Is this really where you're supposed to be?"  and continued "Not Australia?" (I live in central Canada)
<br>
and I replied "Yes this is where I'm supposed to be, I have a job here" It was kind of obvious as to what was happening there. I was very shocked as to what was happening, Ive had these experiences before, on psychedelics, in dreams in obes. This time, I saw the mirror of myself.
<br>
<br>
I know that I've been picked for something and I don't feel bad about saying that here.  Those of us on the astral pulse know - we are going SOMEWHERE and I think we're going to go there together.
<br>
<br>
I've always had this interesting effect on people in person,  I know what it is, and I just need to find an outlet. Now wherever I am, whatever I do, I can always feel this spiritual presence, it is every color, and quite multi dimensional. I can take people here as well. Maybe I will see you up there in the astral plane ....  I have been changed for life.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Have a good day.
<br>
<br>
Nathan

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Congratulations regarding the experience. I was attracted to the title as I had a similar kind of "The One" experience about 7 months ago and it's an experience I will always be living for life.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I have had those as well. But I realized the truth about 'the one' about a month ago and I know what I must accomplish within the spiritual planes. I believe we all have a different job. And I have found out mine.
<br>
<br>
I thank you for posting that experience. It shows I am not the only 'one' I know there are others like me and I am glad to meet another 'one'.

<section>
Yeah as time progresses, I think we'll all find our one self and realize we are all the same working in our own ways towards one goal. However, I do think thats obvious. I know where I am.

Frank, would you classify this as an F4oC experience?

Nathan, Frank and Projector,
<br>
Since you have all had this similar experience I ask if you guys ever felt back in childhood or even now as being 'The One' like in the Matrix or feeling we have a very special mission in
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///life.like" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 life.Like
</a>
Nathan said "I know that I've been picked for something and I don't feel bad about saying that here". I know 'The One'  feeling can seem egocentric and even pathological, but if you acknowledge it as being an universal experience - not just you - then it's perfectly healthy. I never had that kind of experience but felt as being 'The One', or picked for somth like neo in Matrix, when I was a child.
<br>
Projector: you said "I know what I must accomplish within the spiritual planes.". Can you share what it is? (If it's a private thing then forget)

I've felt very different throughout my whole childhood. They said I never cried for examples, I would hug everyone and people said I could never be labeled. I never quite fit in, until I ran into the rave scene and from there, people are extremely friendly and regardless of your affinity to life, they don't judge you. I knew I was different for the past 3 years but it's been very hard to acknowledge and realize.
<br>
<br>
It is most definitely a universal experience. I would never try to say this is just me, however I can say we each have our individual experience of the same thing and different roles in the culmination of "The One" so we are all one, in many ways

<section>
I have felt this my whole life as well but I really never understood it until I began to AP.
<br>
<br>
Ever since I was a small child anyone who met me (spiritual or not) said the same thing "He is destined to do great things" but I never understood that. But you could say I lived an average life except for these intensely real dreams (obes) that I kept having.
<br>
<br>
I then searched through the internet when I was 13 and tried to see what those 'dreams' were. I found out my answer and they were called 'obes'. So I just continued to learn from there..
<br>
<br>
My obes have surpassed 'normal' expectations of an obe. I have accuriqed much wisdom and knowledge from God. I am known as
<b>
 The Projector
</b>
in the astral, many friendly and hostile entites know me by name and have come to show me great respect. I have been called many things in the astral  (ex. King, the flying one, the one, General Projector) I had some entites bow down because of me not of fear but respect..
<br>
<br>
When I said "I know what I must  do" I know that I must become a great projector and fight off evil for the good of my Father.
<br>
<br>
<br>
But the meaning of 'the one' are called the elect. These are people hand picked from God who have and will do his work in both the astral and physical. The elect are gathering..

I don't know, Telos, some of these seem pretty FoC2 to me ...
<br>
<br>
Here I thought I was the only one who had megalomaniac dreams ... but at least I realize they're inside my subconscious and don't really believe I'm Hades reincarnated raising the dead and damned souls to walk free through the planes ...

I was asking because he "could have cried over its awesomeness" and the dawning comprehension of "oneness," and such.

Telos:
<br>
<br>
Are you asking about my experience or the original poster Nathan's experience? If it is the latter then from what I can gauge this is a typical Focus 2 experience of meeting your belief constructs head-on type of thing. The very fact that someone can write about it suggests Focus 2. Focus 4 experiences tend to be beyond words. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

We cross posted and it's obvious now you are speaking of the latter. It's Focus 2, IMO.
