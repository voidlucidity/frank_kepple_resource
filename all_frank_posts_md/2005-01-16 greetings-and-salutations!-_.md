It's been awhile since I've posted on any kind of board...didn't have much of a great experience last time...though it's not due to a flame war of any kind -- just seems trouble follows me and makes it near impossible to keep up or keep in touch with anything. *quiet laugh* Don't ask how many PC's have blown up or stopped functioning due to my use...  One would think that just using a PC in the normal manners would never result in it not working at all...
<br>
<br>
Now for a bit more of a formal introduction. *ahem* To begin with I'm 24, female, married, and live in the southern parts of the USA.  I enjoy reading, writing and pretty much any kind of craft where I can create something -- such as painting figures, scrapbooking, jewelry making, book binding, baking...well it's just whatever I can make it seems. *laughs* Aie me...
<br>
<br>
Call it what you will, but I've hunted and looked around into just about everything I could on things metaphysical...at first due to a personal interest, but then because I wanted to learn more about the oddness I felt in, about, and around me.
<br>
<br>
A friend of mine introduced me to some of Robert Bruce's work...that in turn lead me to this place.  I have to say after reading a lot his work it made a lot more sense than most of the stuff I'd ran across in my previous reading material.  Not that there wasn't much value to what I read (there's always a bit of something worth knowing in all things) just that it didn't exactly help me personally make much personal progress.
<br>
<br>
Yikes...I write far too much in essay style... *ahem* Well in short pretty much I'm hoping my PC will remain in one piece as I try to continue learning and growing though what I may find here on this board.  ^.^'  Forgive me if I ramble on too much...I tend to be long winded in trying to make myself clear and avoid being misunderstood.
<br>
<br>
So I think that about does it for me for now. *waves* Hello to all the members of the board. ^_^
