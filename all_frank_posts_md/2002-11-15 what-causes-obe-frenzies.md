Two times in my life I've had something I would call an OBE-frenzy. This is when you sleep and your body goes into the exit-phase spontanously, but if you try to break it off, it will still continue to push you out. Its like its in OBE-mode. It is actually hard to keep yourself in the body (usually its the opposit). I had this the first time a few years ago and it realy scared the living crap out of me. The last time I had it, I had a little more know of what was going on, so I took advantage of it and I had several succesful OBE's. Paralysis was always present under the OBE's but I always managed to pull out of it to take notes and have my next OBE.
<br>
I was just wondering if anyone else have any experience with this?
<br>
It could be very usefull to know what causes this coz to me now this must be an OBE'ers dream

This naturally tendency to "project" ones double is called the projection reflex....we all project almost every night and sometimes, for whatever reason, we "wake" up even if it's not consciously desired.

What does that mean? That every dream is a projection? I know many says that we project every night but what is the point or purpose of it if we are not wake or cant even remeber it. It all seem's so illogical. The word conscious to me means "awake" and "have the ability to think and figure out" just like the state Im in when Im writing this, wich is not the state Im in when I dream. I do believe that its posible to project with out being "fully" awake. I just have a hard time accepting that I have projectet and had the exit-reflex almost every night and I dont even have slight memory of it. To me thats like driving on a lonesome road and suddernly you hit a cow, and just keep driving and did'nt even notice.
<br>
<br>
But my point with this topic was to see if anyone had experienced multiple OBE's or OBE-frenzies wich is the state when the OBE's just wont quit. Even if you just wanna go back to sleep, but just keep being kicked out.
<br>
It could be intresting to know, coz Im trying to map what the ideal conditions for this state is. Like what food to eat that day or how many ours of sleep before, or amount of water to drink  or anything wich could help to make this achievable at any time. I dont mean in exact numbers but just something wich could lead somewhere.

What we call "dreams" is what is labelled as Monroe's (mental) Focus 22. However, the BIG difference between the Focus 22 state (as taught by Monroe) and the F22 state of a dream... is your level of conscious awareness. Dreams, are Astral projections: only with a very limited sense of conscious awareness. The key difference, always, is your level of conscious awareness and the extent to which you can keep random thoughts in check (at the time).

I can get that. But the way I see (not that I know much about this) but it seems when you're  dreaming, its your subconscious mind who takes charge. That is why you do alot of crazy things wich you normaly would not do, and are barely a spectator of whats happening, and remember that way to. But  what happens to the exit and reentry sensations. Do we still experience them when we're asleep or do they just go strong when we are "aware". When I have had spontanous OBE's, I wake up because of the strong falling sensations. I have never woken up and just found my self out of body.
<br>
I have however found myself awake in I dream wich then became a lucid dream, but to me that is quite different. In a dream or better yet a lucid dream I can do everything I want, only the thoughts are the limit, but when Im in an OBE there seems to be many limits. Not compared to the physical world but I dont have as much control as I would in a dream.
<br>
Example: I cant "walk" in an OBE. Only fly. And sometimes I cant even fly where I want the "wind" just take me somewhere. There is some resistance when you thurst trough matter. I cant move any physical objects when Im in an OBE. These things never happens in dreams or lucid dreams. In lucid dreams you can do everything. Although OBE's can be very affected visually by the subconscious.
<br>
This is where I stall. I must laugh cuz when I started getting into this I thought I would get some answers by actually getting OBE's, but whenever I got my precious answer it came with a 100 more questions

fLURIX. it does get interesting! after having obe's i started dreaming about them, then the dreams started getting more and more like real obe's, and I think the important part is to try to be aware and pay attention!

I do sometimes have kind of "OBE frenzies". For me, they come hand in hand with the paralysis, where I actually have real trouble not being sucked back into the astral - even if I don't want to be , like if I'm having some kind of nasty encounter.
<br>
<br>
I agree that dreaming is just a less conscious version of projecting. As time goes on, I'm realizing more and more just how much dreams are like two-dimnsional stage props; something our subconscious builds up to accomodate its own needs. When I become lucid mid-dream, I notice that the difference between what is created by me and what is part of the astral world becomes very clear. Particularly when it comes to people.

Agreed that "frenzies are hand in hand with paralysis". I think thats part of what makes them so scary! I havent had sleep paralysis for awhile tho, but have had frenzies, and i attribute the main cause to be location.
<br>
I stayed at my aunt and uncles house in rual illinois last summer, and WOAH! it was like as soon as i begun my NEW exercises i was feeling some serious energy. And if i ever lost concentration and came back to physical, all i had to do was go through my routine again. Needless to say, i really got some things accomplished on the astral last summer
