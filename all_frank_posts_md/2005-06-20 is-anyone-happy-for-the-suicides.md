<section>
I always thought it was hypocritical to take someone who committed suicide - someone who potentially reached the lowest point of life possible - and then tinkle on their grave with condemnation. In other words the fanatics who say suicides are evil mortal sinners seem to take delight in pointing out the suffering of people and saying, "yes, indeed they are suffering, shame on them."
<br>
<br>
But I digress.
<br>
<br>
I just heard word of someone my age committing suicide. I thought, "good for him!" Obviously, I bite my tongue in real life, but not here.
<br>
<br>
Suicides are  nothing new. But why do I always hear it buttressed with debasing highfalutin snobbery... that the person was "mental", "screwed up" and "not right." Regardless of your religion or personal ethics or the actual mental health of the individual... why are we so quick to make such scathing assumptions about a person who is (quite literally) already down? Why beat a dead horse, except to make yourself feel an illustion of strength? It's
<i>
 dead
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Nevermind that question.
<br>
<br>
I just want to know. Is there anyone who is happy? Isn't there anyone who has faith that the universe, God, the soul, or whatever powers that be are good and will work things in everyone's favor? Is there no one who has an unshakable optimism?
<br>
<br>
I almost want to celebrate.

It depends on your viewpoint. What are virtues? Is selfishness a virtue? If so, then suicide is perfectly fine.
<br>
<br>
Suicide, in most cases, causes other people lots of grief. We are a society, we are social creatures - what we do affects others. Those who commit suicide might escape, but they have shrugged off their pain onto others. And I doubt that in the afterlife the issues that lead to suicide are totally absolved. There's still a major issue to deal with.

The natural and healthy condition is to enjoy life. Something has to really warp a person to make it possible to commit suicide. It is like being stuck in a trance, but a harmful and deeply restrictive type of trance.

Well I think everyone should have the right to kill themselves, however it should be discouraged.

And is anyone happy, I'm sure there are people who are perfectly happy. And people whose life is bittersweet, a bit happy a bit sad. I'm pretty hopeful myself.

To me, suicide should be treated like the abortion issue- as an option, but a last resort. With abortion we supply birth control, with suicide we provide the tools to deal with what could cause suicide.
<br>
<br>
I believe in reincarnation and karma, so, in my opinion, taking the way out through suicide is just going to land you somewhere worse than you are now.

<section>
Well I personally wouldnt kill myself, because I dont think you(im not talking about one person just someone in general)  should.  Not because of the whole christian idea of it, but my own.  I think you shouldnt commit suicide because you are meant to live.  If there is no point in being born, then you wouldnt be born.  Nature fits everything together in our world, everything has a role from bugs to dust.  Even though you have the power to kill yourself, I dont think someone should.  I know somtimes life gets really bad and I understand the feeling of wanting to not exist but there is always an option out.  But no matter how bad life gets there is sombody somwhere whos got it worse than you.  Life is precious and you should never throw it away.  There are thousands of people who want to live that get killed everyday, their lives taken from them and you still got yours.
<br>
<br>
I thinks someone on the first page said 'suicide is natural' no its not.  Whens the last time a bear hung itself.  Ive never seen a raccoon intentionally run out infront of a car.  Humans are the only animals capable to commit suicide.

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
I think people ought to consider there is a difference nowadays between what we call "suicide" and an act of self-deliverance. An act of self-deliverance is classed as a logical decision by the person in question. Whereas a suicide is generally classed as an irrational decision by someone in dire need of psychological help as a result of clinical depression and/or what we would class as mental illness.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, some forms of mental illness are tantamount to torture. It can very easily reach the stage where the person in question feels they simply have no alternative but death [as a form of escape]. It is all very well for the sociologically comfortable to pass their judgement upon these people. Social snobbery takes many forms I suppose. But go and actually work with these people and then see how you feel.
<br>
<br>
The whole question, I would suggest, is a LOT more complex than most people assume. In the first instance, I would recommend people read Final Exit by Derek Humphry. He touches on a number of important basic issues regarding this.
<br>
<br>
Plus, I would respectfully suggest people try to gain an understanding of this issue by actually working with people who feel a psychological need to do away with themselves, as it were, as I did for a number of years. I think you would find it rather enlightening, but enlightening in a real sense, not in a happy-clappy we all are all one and oh so [pseudo] enlightened New-Age sense.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
I have contemplated killing myself during times of distress and in times of inquiry.  I often wonderd what would happen if I just shot myself in the head.  Just for curiosity's sake.  But during times when I was extremely fustrated with life, I thought about killing myself and then I thought of another way out.  I know some people dont have the luxury of having somewhere to go for a while, but I live at the edge of a large forest.  I have considred just dissapearing for a month or two, cutting contact with everyone.  That would be like killing myself, but I still get to live.  I would have peace and be able to come in contact with my innerself and with the earth.   So if anyone in here is thinking about killing themselves because life is hard, dont, just escape by leaving, dont comeback untill you feel better.  But if you are thinking about doing it because you feel it will help you acheive a greater level of enlightment, dont.  Just finish up your life here, have some fun with it,  go and travel see all that life has to offer.

The trouble with suicide is reincarnation. I still think that it is better to stay with the current life which is a known quantity than to gamble on the next.

Every person, if they lived enough billions of years in the same body, would choose suicide eventually. Some prefer a shorter time. The thread title asks if I'm happy for the suiciders, not their friends and relatives. If they prefer it, yes.

<section>
I think that suicide caused by depression is always a tragedy, because there are many better ways to fix the problems(if there's afterlife suicide doesn't solve anything). I also think that suicide caused by a REAL problems is a tragedy too, and altough I understand the motivations of the person it still makes me sad.
<br>
The only kind of suicide that I think is a good way to die is when a soldier/guerilla commits suicide to avoid being captured by the enemy.

I just thought it would be nice to toast the passing of an individual who ostensibly had a deep and fragile relationship with existence. Good luck to him in the great unknown. May the guides clear his path and his passage be free!

It is hard for happy and healthy people to imagine suicide, so the only conclusion which makes sense is that something went wrong. The next step is to try to determine what it was and why, out of fear that it could happen to them, too.

My step mother killed herself after years of abusing me and my siblings,   usually just me.   We still don't understand why it was mostly me.  Only when my brother or sister tried to get her attention away from me would they get it.   I guess you could say it was a relief when she took all those pills....  I just wish she wouldn't have gotten her hair done, put on her wedding dress, crawl onto my bed, tie a couple of garbage bags around her head knowing darn well my father was going to find her.
<img alt=":evil:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/evil.png" title="evil"/>
Oh not to mention she drained my fathers savings and gave it all to her two boys.
<br>
<br>
She planned everything.   That made me angry for years, I don't give a flying fart what was up with her mind.  She was a angry woman and now I have no problems with it, but man oh man, did I.
<br>
<br>
I was surprised when the police were tearing the house apart they found a bunch of books hidden behind the bookcase that were about witch craft and ones that told her how to do the deed.  Amazing that there are books out there for any subject.

For many of my teenage years I wanted death simply because I hated life.  Now in my early 20's I want death as frank said for self deliverance.  I have a few things I wish to still accomplish here and I do have a dream which I am working on accomplishing now, but as a whole this whole physical existence thing is a bit mundane for me.  As a child of 12 I saved a small boy from falling off of a railing about 25 feet up, surely enough to kill him and ever since that day I felt my purpose here was completed.  If I knew for certain that my death would bring no one pain and allow me to go on with my spiritual path releasing me from my limitations in this world I would not give it a second thought.  I would prefer to give my life for something good instead of taking it myself, such as self sacrifice to save someone or further a cause.  I have come to a point in my life where I feel I've got the general idea of this focus and wish to move on permanently.  Don't worry for my safety, I'm not exactly hell bent on my own demise and I firmly believe that I was given this life for a reason, but have I already fulfilled it?
<br>
<br>
Am I happy for suicides??  I don't know, it depends on their fate after death.  If they are indeed reincarnated as a lower form or punished severely for their lack of self love than no, if they are released from their pain and freed spiritually to roam the various FoC's with tears of joy and release in their eyes, then of course I am.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
To my mind, the problem here is in the original question. Could any thinking, feeling, compassionate human-being feel HAPPY for someone who has gone through the mental trauma that let to their self-inflicted demise?
<br>
<br>
I just think not.
<br>
<br>
Happiness is the wrong word, IMO. Compassion, yes, but happiness? I have worked with these people and have empathised with their pain too often to think it is something I should feel happy about.

Am I happy for her now, you mean?  IMO, I think she has to come back and try once again to learn the lessons that she needed to learn, perhaps she did learn some but she should have stuck it out.   Personally I think killing onself is a selfish and cowardly act.   And I'm pretty sure she figured that out right away..

I am happy for the completeness of their lifetime, regardless of where it leads. This nominal if narrow sense of "completeness" is tangible and consistent hope of a much larger completeness.

All in all I'd say to commit suicide over a negative thoughts in your mind that are eating at you is wrong, but to do it in a no-other-choice situation, or if they are 'looking' for better things thanks to the current world we live in, and can do it with a pure heart, then I think it is ok

I'm curious, how many of you whom have commented on this thread have had a close experience with suicide?  For instance...someone you knew more than casually that had killed themselves?
<br>
<br>
I don't want to say that your feelings are null and void, but it really is hard to put yourself in those shoes....they're quite big.  Speculation on what you think your feelings on the subject would be are a far cry from how you would actually act....or feel.
<br>
<br>
Just saying,

I really didn't want this thread to be a discussion on when suicide is "okay" or not, but because of my ambiguity I supposed I asked for it. I wanted to focus to be on us, the survivors, and how we deal with it. Thank you Nay, for asking this question.
<br>
<br>
I actually know very few people more than casually. Part of it is because all the people I know end up moving away, going to different schools and different lives, or I moved away and went to a different school and a different life, etc. But I

 know
</i>
, without speculating one bit, that if someone close to me committed suicide, it would only propel me to look for more happiness and beauty in the world. It would only force me with the ineluctable decision to either be happy or sad for them - and I would do my best to choose to be happy.

My uncle fell off a cliff while on a camping trip. He had been drinking and the weather was bad. He just stepped over that fence to get a better view, and he slipped. His fiancee found him. He had just gotten a promotion at work and he was going to be married. They went out to celebrate. I was young enough at the time to actually believe it happened the way my parents said it did.

Yes, very close experience. She was a youngster, female, boyfriend left her and her world fell apart. She died in my arms as I heard the ambulance arriving. Something I will never forget. Still got the whacking great scar on my inner forearm from punching my fist through the side window to get the front door open. Tore my inner forearm in half. 20 years later I still remember it like it was yesterday.

Direct experience? Yes! more than once.  Had a friend that suicided.  Also took a loaded and cocked 9mm pistol out someones hand.  Young people.
<br>
<br>
Now if I was terminally ill and new physical death was near, I would reject any type of extenstion efforts, not allow to be  plugged in, but that is different.

Telos, answering to your question: people laugh at suicidal guys because:
<br>
1) thats an emotional way to deal with the situation. Suicidal its hard to accept, so a natural response its laugh at that. Humour (even black humour) its a way to deal with things.
<br>
<br>
2) thats the Darwin natural evolution. People dont give to much attention to suicidal dudes because they are weak (in the view of the people that laugh at them). If they are weak (not in my view) they must get out of this world (again, not my speech) because they are not useful. Like any other animal, humans try to raise and give attention only to the best of the best. Every body worships Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Why? BEcause they are good looking and that = good genes = better humans with more capabilities to survive.
<br>
<br>
No one worships suicidal guys for the opposite reason.
<br>
<br>
Unforunatly that the way things work in this western world.
<br>
<br>
People shoould give more attention to the ones suffering in silence. One word of wisdom, one friendly touch, sometimes the people (suicidal) just need that and no one gives it.

Your welcome Telos.  Seems weird to say you're welcome on such a subject and I don't want to lessen anything, but you are welcome non the less.

I understand what you are saying about caring about what the person was thinking, feeling or going thru before they did the deed.  Yet, I suppose there are different outlooks on it...as it is with most things.
<br>
<br>
For instance... if my husband decided to leave his family because of whatever hardship he was dealing with and couldn't handle, I would be ticked!  I would wonder what the heck it was that we did to cause him to think he no longer could or wanted to stay here.
<br>
<br>
Of course that comes with the line of knowing...eh, ok.... at least
<i>
 thinking
</i>
that he was perfectly fine.  There are sooooo many different scenarios to this particular upset, that there is no way to pigeon hole it at all.  You just can't....
<br>
<br>
Of course, all my opinion..aka, IMO.  Just had to add that for the fellow member whom asked what IMO means.

I'm sorry to hear this Tom.   However, are you saying he did it on purpose?  Did he want to end his life, or just had one of those bad decision days? (Drinking and climbing on high places)  Do you suspect foul play?

That is intense to say the least.  Holding someone while they die is an experience that is either embraced or shunned..   Do you think you took something from it though?  Did it make you see life...or death, differently?

So your friend embraced life as well?  I get the feeling that that was one thing he always did.  He felt more for others than himself...  Lots of people feel that way and it is a shame!
<br>
<br>
Alot of us are always feeling like we're not being heard, felt, or understood correctly.  And then turn around and beat ourselves up about it...LOL...that is crazy.
<br>
<br>
About the terminally ill......hmm...yeah, I have to say I don't want to be hooked up to machines to keep me alive.   Yet, I wouldn't want to leave my family hurting so I would hang on as long as I could, thus causing their pain even greater by having to watch me die slowly.  That sucks for them and me both..  How does one make that decision?   I think I'll leave that for if or when I have to make it.  And hope I die in my sleep.  Ahhh...the way to go.  Everyone is very calm when a loved one dies in their sleep, right?

Hi All,
<br>
<br>
I've been reading these replies with much interest, and everyone here has a point to ponder in one fashion or another. As it is a tough subject to broach.
<br>
<br>
To answer the original question....  I don't rejoice when someone commits suicide, I do however understand the need or want to 'be done' with their life, as I'm sure others here can as well.  Life is so incredibly hard at times.
<br>
<br>
I have personally known people who've committed suicide, and I have personally known a couple of people that have killed another person... (but that's another thread).  The bottom line with suicide is that I genuinely feel sad for them that they feel they have no other option other than to take their own lives.
<br>
<br>
I believe in re-incarnation and karma, so for me suicide is not a realistic option.  When I hear of people taking there own lives, I do not rejoice, my soul is sad for them.
<br>
<br>
However... a little off topic perhaps.... I do rejoice (on the inside) when people pass on, but not by their own hand.
<br>

Maybe I have a twisted view on this but I feel like I need to live for them. Just continue for them something they could not, see and feel what they didn't. Unlike 'natural' deaths, suicide reinforces me the idea that a life is something to be experienced in it's fullest form, both pain and bliss, because all the petty struggles go away. And if I can't take it anymore then maybe someone will do it for me.
