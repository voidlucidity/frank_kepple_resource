<section>
I have been plagued many years now by 'voices', ideas and suggestions often negative, appearing out of nowhere and then planting themselves firmly in my mind. Often i have the feeling that my personality is taken over by something or someone who then puts these thoughts in my mind that i have tried very hard to ignore or shake off without much success. I qualify myself as being a normal individual leading a normal life, but this is indeed very distressing to me as often these alien thoughts clash with my own thought patterns and behaviour. It is often as if i am 'forced' to think or act in a particular way. This results in a fierce battle within myself where i will try to forcefully push these negative thoughts out of my mind in trying to regain my own 'self'.
<br>
<br>
I have read of split personalities, OCD, possession, schizophrenia and i believe i do not suffer from any of those. Has anyone else also had similar experiences? Pls respond with your ideas, suggestions re this.

Sometimes I get these random foriegn thoughts out of nowhere....and sometimes they are something I would never even consciously choose to ever ever want to think...
<br>
But they pop out of nowhere anyway
<br>
But Im not sure if its the same as you...its not like a problem I have or anything
<br>
I never payed much attention to it...
<br>
Just dismissed it as stray thoughts or something
<br>
But Ive thought about it a few times and why the hell such thoughts would even pop into my mind .....they do really seem foreign...I dunno weird stuff

I am not sure if it is the same thing but I will have these thoughts appear out of nowhere and they are usually negative and contrary to what I would usually think. Thinking about it this use to happen to me a lot when I was younger, but rarely happens now. Actually from my experiences I think I might know a way to help you. Try to build up your concentration. During the day try not to let your mind just wonder off to do whatever. Meditate when you get a chance. Since I have been practicing building my concentration and meditating these "voices" have seemed to stop. I think this holds true because as of late I have not been doing these things so my mind has slipped a little and I noticed one of those thoughts the other day. Try not to give much thought to them when they appear. That seems to give them more weight. At the same time do not get upset when they appear as that also seems to give them weight. When one shows up just let it roll off of you like it is nothing. I have found this seems to help as well.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My thoughts:
<br>
Though I am not certain I have read some things recently that might point to what this voices are. They maybe low level spirits trying to distract you. These low level spirits that tend to hand around the physical plane are not every spiritually evolved. They are usually full of hate and anger and try to push their feelings on to those on the physical. But if you do not give them much thought and gain more control over your mind they seem to leave you alone. Seems they like wondering minds as they are easy to contact. A strong mind would easily be able to push them away. These are my thoughts anyway.
<br>
<br>
On one hand it is nice to know that I am not the only one that has experienced this, on the other I am sorry that another has to experience this as it can be very annoying. I wish you luck.

Sorry for the long post, but i felt i absolutely had to share this with you all and in doing so want to ask your help with whatever i'm dealing with.
<br>
<br>
It comforts me a bit to know that i am not going nuts, that instead it might be a 'neg problem' after all. What i didn't mention in my earlier post is that i suffer frequently from nightmares where i find myself on the run trying to escape some faceless powerful entity. Often this evil Being will fly after and catch hold of me, and me being so scared and thinking it is for real will then wake up in terror. I have had trouble sleeping peacefully for as long as i can remember now, and rarely passes a night in which i am not woken atleast 3-4 times, often without any good reason to it. Sound sleep comes to me only in the morning usually after day break.
<br>
<br>
Now i  begin to wonder if i am under a severe psychic attack that i am unaware of?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
Robert has mentioned proceedures following which one can lessen the impact of a direct psychic attack. But how does one get rid of, reduce, eliminate alien thought pattens being forced in your mind by negs. Would this also be called a form of psychic attack???
<br>
<br>
My problem is that most of these are directed against myself, almost as if it were i wishing bad things to happen to me!!! Believe me this scares the hell out of me, bec why would i WANT problems and troubles to follow me! At times when it is others i think?? negative about, i end up having to experience the situation myself, another reason why these 'thoughts' terrify me.
<br>
<br>
If indeed , my troubles are caused by negs, i am begining to feel a rightful anger against these creatures and wish to fight back. Indeed i feel its payback time #$%@! In this i ask all of your help. Pls share your experiences about this, if any. What might be the most effective way to guard oneself against strong, negative, often scary and obsessive thoughts.

  I went through the same thing some years back.  For about a month I was too afraid to sleep for the nightmares.  Thinking back, I'm sure it was some kind of psychic attack.  The main thing is not to feel fear - the hardest thing to do, but know that nothing can really harm you.  Do not be angry - that is a by-product of fear.  Ask for help from a higher source, it is there if you need it.  And dont give any energy to negativity, that means not paying any attention to negative thoughts and immediately replacing those thoughts with positive thoughts, instead of trying to analyse why, how, what, where...  Find yourself a positive 'mantra'  or prayer and say it over and over, when you need to, so there is no room for anything else.   Listen to music that you like, to lift your mood.  It will pass so be patient.  Be aware, but dont pay attention.

What you are experiencing is the typical kind of emotional interplay that goes on within the base-level Astral region. Your problems feel like they are being directed against yourself, by yourself, because that is precisely what is happening.
<br>
<br>
Understand that fear is a very prevalant emotion amongst people generally. What happens is (often with children) while sleeping it is possible for your mind to get stuck in a base-level Astral region. A region that is just beyond ordinary dreaming, that I termed the Training Ground (beyond which is the Astral proper).
<br>
<br>
In this state, your sense of conscious awareness has woken up, but only to a limited extent. It hasn't woken up enough to give yourself your normal, full degree of conscious understanding.
<br>
<br>
Under such conditions, you find yourself having some of your senses working, like, you have sight, plus maybe hearing, together with motor control, i.e. the ability to move. But your powers of conscious reasoning, longer-term memory, and so forth; in other words, the part of your mind that forms your "higher intelligence aspects" are missing.
<br>
<br>
Under such conditions, it is only natural for you to become a little fearful. What happens is your base-level fight/flight response, finding yourself in some kind of abnormal mental condition, wonders what the heck is happening... then all hell breaks loose.
<br>
<br>
BIG PROBLEM IS: on the Astral, thought -release- emotion is a primary energy. I've posted on this subject before so, if you are interested, then you might find it beneficial to read some of my past postings.
<br>
<br>
It is all too easy to get in a downward spiral. The only way of stopping it is to wake up. Usually at some moment of trepidation where you are going to be eaten by some monster or other.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Well, it could be monsters, or being thrown off tall buildings, or whatever. That basically depends on the character of the person in question. With me, I got stuck in this region for about 5 years. I'd had quite a turbulent upbringing, so I tended to experience lots of violence in the form of fighting wars and fighting all kinds of demons, slaying dragons, etc.
<br>
<br>
Also, it is only natural for you to get angry and want to fight back. Yes, I know that feeling only too well. However, the anger you feel will simply be reflected back at you causing you to feel ever more angry. The greater level of anger will cause yet a greater level of angryness to be reflected back at you; thus causing you to feel ever more angry, and so on.
<br>
<br>
Again, the only way out of this downward spiral is an enforced awakening, usually at some unbearably scary moment.
<br>
<br>
If this situation is allowed to continue, following the "fighting back" stage, comes the "possession" stage. As I say, fighting back merely makes the situation worse. The reason is because it is *your* emotional energy that is directly fuelling the circumstances that surround you. As the situation deteriorates, then it is only normal a person would, in some way, feel "possessed".
<br>
<br>
Again, problem is, uncontrolled feelings of possession will simply act as yet more fuel for the fire, so to speak. Meaning circumstances will come about in order to justify such feelings, etc., etc. So the downward spiral continues, ad nauseum.
<br>
<br>
The proper solution is to realise the truth of the matter. Which is all too easy to say but ever so hard to put into practice *at the time*.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

greetings Utopia ,
<br>
It would appear to me that what you are experiencing is your own ego's. I find it easy to look at life from the point of view that whilst hear in the physical our consciousness is never to a great extent our own.
<br>
<br>
The Ego's originate from above the physical and enter when they get a chance. By practicing self awareness,concentration and being in the momment ect, you can watch them coming in and out so to speak. Watching them is one thing, getting rid of them is another, there numbers are many and they do not like to be suppressed or
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///annialated.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 annialated.You
</a>
are lucky in a sense that you are aware of these thought's,study them well and then hit em where it hurts, there is a saying, that whilst on a spititual path, "you must die unto yourself".
<br>
Do not fall into the trap of thinking that the Ego's are something totally external to us, they are the main sum of us.There is not much of the divine that has a chance to shine.
<br>
I've done a lot of work in the physical in relation to ego's l and thats what has led me to this forum. I'm hoping to further my spiritual work in the astral and above. Reading Franks reply to your post reinforces the fact that I'm the right path.( Frank if you read this, "write a book mate")
<br>
<br>
Regards Steve
