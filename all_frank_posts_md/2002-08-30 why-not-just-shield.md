<section>
Ok, I've been gone for while....maybe it's my mood, or just a new perspective, but I really have to ask....
<br>
<br>
Why are so many people having so many problems with entities ('negs') and such?  A couple of months of daily work...and nothing arduous mind you....should be enough for the vast majority of people to learn to make shields effective enough to keep out all but the most skilled of entities.  And those are few and far between.  There's a lot of spirit fauna out there, but the bulk of it is the equivalent of squirrels and mosquitos, not pit bulls and alligators.
<br>
<br>
I mean, come on...running water?  Garlic?  Get a grip!  You fight energy with ENERGY.  YOU are a spirit entity, as much as they are, and you can use the same abilities.  You're also bigger and stronger than the vast majority of them, if you only take the time to learn how to use it.  Sure, a mouse can bite a cat on the nose if the cat doesn't know how to hunt, but the cat SHOULD be able to take out that mouse easily.  What I'm seeing here is the cat's trying to get the mouse off it's nose by tapping it with a piece of cheese, or putting pepper under its nose to make it sneeze.
<br>
<br>
Use your claws and teeth!  It's simple, direct, and NOT that difficult.  Do some basic training--NEW here, even, will give you the energy control necessary to shield well and hit back, if you only apply it.
<br>
<br>
I just don't understand!!

What the mouse relies on is finding some sort of crack in the cat's defenses, so it can slip under the cat's skin. Then it drink's the cat's blood and sticks its snout out to breathe (mice breathe hundreds of times per minute and their pulse is also hundreds of beats per minute). Most adult cats are injured by school, parents, friends, employers, and other people in just such a way as to create the cracks mice love to hide in. When everything is out in the open, it is easy to deal with the problem. Most cats are accustomed to hiding the cracks from themselves and do not accept that mice exist. It is a lengthy process to go from the usual starting position to complete health.

<section>
Yes, but again, all it takes is a few months of work for a cat to learn how to use its claws--it can then dig out the mice no matter where they may be hiding.  It can certainly prevent further mouse infestation, if it should need to get help with a mouse removal.

<section>
The only time I've been effectively attacked was before I learned how to shield properly.
<br>
My shields are 24/7.  If something came along that could break them, and I couldn't drive it away with a counterattack, I'd ask friends/mentor for help, of course.  So far, this hasn't happened.  My shields have held against everything/everyone that's tried to attack me.

<br>
Mainly because most people dont know how to shield and because they dont think they need to. People generally only start to think about shielding *after* having realized they have a neg problem. And if the neg has managed to entrench itself into the person then a shield wont solve the problem. It might prevent future attachments but the person still has a neg to get rid of.

It can block any psi if you construct it properly.

It's not just the people who didn't know, and have learned their lesson now...but there's an amazing number who have a problem with entity attacks, and STILL fail to even try to learn how to shield, so they continue to have problems over and over.

 Charge your skin. Visualize a beam of light coming from your head, and contacting your entire body--where it touches, the energy on your skin solidifies into an impenetrable barrier. (If you know how, do this by projecting the energy from your head). Be sure to concentrate on the barrier becoming impenetrable.

<br>
How does one "charge your skin?".  Where do you draw this energy from with which to sheild?  And how does the beam of light come out from your head and contact your whole body?  I can imagine a hole in my head that light flows out of and down my body, not a beam?

<section>
I totally believe in psychic shields, and it makes me shiver to think that people deal in the spirital relms without it.  I shield myself EVERY day before I even interact with anyone ,and I even shield my car or any vehicle that I have to ride in.  There are negatives all around us.  It doesn't have to be just negative entities but any negative thoughts and feelings that are thrown your way.
<br>
<br>
Your best friend is having a bad day and vents on you, without a psychic shield all those bad vibes drain you emotionally, mentally and energetically.  Even your aura suffers and weakens.  A shield doesn't stop all the neg vibes but at least some.
<br>
<br>
I envision  the most purest white light that you can, feel it's warmth and positive energy.  You can start at your feet or at the top of your head.  I like the top of my head.  Envision a glowing orb of that white light at the top of your head and see and feel it coming down over your head, neck and all the way down your body.  Your body will grow warm most of the time.  When I start at my head I can see a soft glow of light with my eyes shut even in a dark room as it starts at top and goes over my face.  After you are done, envision your whole body engulfed in this warm pure white light  make it grow as bright as you can make it.  And remember that when you are being attacked that you are well protected.
<br>
<br>
*I thought that everyone knew of such sately precautions!!!
<br>
<br>
People really should check out astralpulses many link sites on protection.

Hi - just in case any of you have trouble sending shielding material out from your heads, you are not alone!  I have a heckuva time with it, so I pick a different part of my body.  My chest works real good, I can get a shield up in seconds.  I just feel an energy blast from either the heart or solar plexus spreading about your body and forming a bubble.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, when I'm in a hurry, I can send shielding material out of my hands, feet, head, chest.  Bam!  Shields up!  Just like StarTrek.

mcarthur said: "People generally only start to think about shielding *after* having realized they have a neg problem." you're probably right, but for myself, i realized that it would take longer to develop attacking capabilities than defensive ones, so i developed defensive capabilities first. plus i was still going through the "am i insane or is this really happening" stage
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
, so i would think i was less insane by trying to defend myself than by trying to figure out it this stuff was real.
<br>
<br>
funny thing is, i don't even shield now!  :p  i just take life as it comes, deal with the crap and enjoy the joy. i gained a lot of power and skill in the martial arts and i used the training to help me become more powerful using energy and being able to attack spiritual beings that attacked me. me fierce tiger, not some lame housecat
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.
<br>
<br>
my philosophy is that you shouldn't block out life and pretend it isn't there (and yes, i know you aren't pretending it isn't by using shielding), but that you should have fun when it comes to you and stick it through the bad times because you can then help others through similar experiences when they go through it.

<section>
Hey, all
<br>
<br>
kakkarot, glad to see you are holding true to form, dude. Unfortunatly most people do not have the energy skills you do, let alone the willingness to attack back. I am not sure of your "awareness" ability, but what do you do if you are asleep, or otherwise incapacitated. I had one attack at the moment of release during an intimate moment with my wife. I am not developed enough (nor do I have the desire) to keep that much of my mind "reserved" all of the time.
<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts, dude. I worry that some day a dragon is going to come along and singe that tigers tale of yours. And I have lived through that, it IS NOT fun.
<br>
<br>
As to the rest, I too did not realized the neccesity until it was to late. Or the full. I created some stuff, but did not check up on it, or truly learn how to monitor things. And then I was not able to.....
<br>
<br>
I think Winged Wolfs point is very legite. Walking around without some form of shield, or at least a perimeter warning system is like being in the wrong part of town, displaying a lot of money, and looking helpless. Sooner or later something or somebody is going to make a move for the easy target.
<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.
<br>
<br>
Take care, all.

<section>
Hi all
<br>
<br>
The way I see it I put a lot of effort into my development and I dont want my time or energy taxed by getting into fights I dont have to. Or worse outright losing a fight with a powerful neg and being damaged from it. Yes a human aware of what they really are is something to be reckond with, but there is no positive to being attacked other than the potential for the satisfaction of lessor emotions.
<br>
<br>
I also have a question on shielding, I was going to start a new thread on shieldind methods but here will do.
<br>
<br>
Ok the method Winged Wolf mentions and the suit of light method ect, all create a shield around the body. What Im curious about is the protection of the aura and if it is covered by such a method. I have read many times  that thought forms exist inside the aura, I am curious if a shield that covers the skin will keep out forms that attack the aura, or only negs and people who try to attach directly to the energy body or an energy center.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps constructing an egg or sphere of light about say 7ft in diameter (or across in the case of the egg - an egg's more to the shape of the aura) would be sure to block out all forms of nasty more effectively? I have an efective shielding method using a sphere but some good points have been raised in the favour of a permanent shield. My only concern is that some of the methods of sealing the aura I have will make you hard to identify with if used for any extended period of time (as anothers aura can not share with yours - a normal part of being near someone). This can potentially break up relationships and lose friends because people dont feel they know you anymore. If a permanent sheild has the same effect than that is a serious negative to consider.
<br>
<br>
If anyone has any ideas I would be greatful
<br>
<br>
best regards
<br>

or run the heck away if i REALLY have to.
<br>
<br>
but still, i view shielding to be part of fighting (unless you are shielding for a more mundane reason, like because you are a very sensitive type and you shield to prevent an overload of emotions surging through you in crowded areas) so why bother until you actually do encounter a fight? i view it as a waste of time and energy to do things you don't need to. train to get really good at raising shields quickly, then you really don't need to worry much. and, luckily enough, it doesn't take much time, for most people, to learn how to shield quickly.

Hello Kakkarot
<br>
I see shielding as a way to prevent fights. It can be used to keep out any energy that you do not want in your aura or your space. Anyone that does magic or has psi abilities in any way should learn how to do this. It makes your life easier and also makes it where you don't take a chance on anything harming you.
<br>
I use a circle of energy around my physical self, my mental self and my astral self.  I try to make it vibrate and resonate at a high frequency. I add in any special touches that I want to the intent of the energy. Example-reversal of bad energy, camoflage, confusion etc.) I do this every morning and then go about my day.

<section>
Why would you want to open yourself to needless damage from attacks.  And what about those attacks that you aren't even aware of causing damage to your chakras and energy systems and other vital areas.
<br>
<br>
I don't find shields a nuisannce at all, in fact I find them refreshing and peaceful.  Since shields are made of  positive energies, I don't see how your aura would be shielded from other positive people.  This is only my opinion. Maybe if you could alternate different shield types.
<br>
<br>
As with a shield being large enough to protect your aura, I personally "will" my "suit of light" to include my aura.
<br>
<br>
I have recently read about a different type of shielding, using symbols that wilt as it encounters negative influences.  Basically, you envision a symbol that is meaningful to you such as a rose or a car ( if you love a certain car)or what ever.   See one above your head, under your feet, one in front of you and one behind you.  Throughout the day check on their status because they would wilt as it collects the negative influenses.  Replace each one with a new symbol.  Watch as the wilted symbol desintegrates to dust before you.
<br>
Has anyone heard of this shield and actually tried using it?  I really would like to know any comments on this.

<section>
Reiki Master: Stay on this thread, you will attract someone who can help you. Get PPSD, there is a lot of good stuff. Also in the download area there are a lot of things that should help. The "Lords Prayer" from the christian faith works wonders, I have removed things using that. Robert lists several psalms in his article in the download area. A Priest or Pastor that will listen to you can do various forms of excorcism both "on location" and from a distance that will help. I recieved help that way also.
<br>
<br>
Fenris: I have learned a shield can be as variably permeable as you want it. This could allow all emotions that nurture a relationship to pass through. It is based on what you set up, and what you let through. You do not need to "maintain" a shield all of the time, plug it into kether (God), there is always energy there, and that is the vibration you are looking for. (I think, anyway).
<br>
<br>
kakkarot: See above. Can you make the direct connection to divinity? I am pretty unknowledgeable about your sources of energy, but I get from your posts that it is more like a "life force" thing than anything else. There are ways to tap into constant energy, where you only need to check things, and expend a very small part of your own energy (maybe none at all) to maintain the shield. I am sure there are people that know ways that suit your system better, but I would recomend the Qabbilistic Cross to you. If you got this down, you should be able to overcome a lot (or all) of the energy starvation problems you encounter. Plus this can be used to channel continous energy into things like shields.
<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, guys. I am no expert, but this is what I have peiced together/found out for myself/had taught to me.

Take care, all.

I have been wondering exactly the same things as Fenris.
<br>
I'm convinced that a shield is truly a valuable thing to have, but I still have some queries regarding its affect on the aura.
<br>
<br>
I'm basically just trying to figure out which type of shield would be best (sphere type, one that touches the skin, or both) I assume that the best type of shielding would be that which is built up of layers (suit type plus sphere layers) but im just curious as to the affects of each one in isolation.
<br>
<br>
Say you constructed a sphere type shield large enough to mask the entire aura (this is taking the assumption that the aura is bounded by space, which could very easily be hooey "?") and you had no others underneath. My question then is 'If someone got close enough to you so as to be within this boundary (say a psi vampire sat next to you on the bus) would they then be free to feed away on your energy, no matter how solid your shield was?
<br>
Or is it all alot more technical than this?
<br>
<br>
Now for the suit type shield that touches the skin:
<br>
does this shield only that which is beneath it? does it shield the whole aura? or is it a matter of intent?
<br>

<br>
<br>
What does the aura look like of someone who has a shield up? is it even readable at all? I'd experiment with this myself but I dont have any friends who shield. Plus I'm only in the begining stages with my auric sight.
<br>

  psi-active persons can deliberately project a color in their aura, so that everyone WILL see that color...but the meaning will be whatever that person thinks it means, not what the viewers think it means. For this reason, my aura is almost ALWAYS blue (my version of octarine) or flame-colored (the phoenix association), or blue-green (my favorite color).
  <br>
  I've yet to hear anyone describe it otherwise. That's simply my self-image, and the blue color means....nothing! It means energy.
  <br>

<br>
<br>
Is this the same as with shields? Will anyone who is trying to read your aura see only the shield which you have constructed?
<br>
<br>
All responses to help ease my confusion would be much appreciated

<section>
Sahlyn,
<br>
<br>
I feel as if I am well shielded, it isn't the most perfect shield and the amount of concentration and energy you put into will be the strength of it.  And as the psi vampires, it depends on how much auric matter they are depleted by vs the strength of your shield.
<br>
<br>
As with being able to read an aura with functioning shield material, my husband as been able to see mine without any difficulty but he isn't a professional.  We all know that an aura can be seen, but who is to say that a shield could even be seen in the physical through the physical eyes.
<br>
<br>
If you aren't happy with the type of shielding out there, use your creative skills and invent your own.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes
<br>
<br>

Here is a great page about Magical Protection that has shielding techniques for those interested and maybe to discuss the methods it mentions. Also if anyone else has a link to similar information/techniques please add the link to this thread.

besides this website. Rawn Clark has a article on shileding in his essays and commentaries. I know that I do multiple layers of shields, that I can pick and chose what I let into my shields, and that I don't use my own energy but a source energy as described in the above article.
<br>
I have had many years of practice with them. I notice no effect upon my aura and anyone can color their energy anything they want too. It will still be the colors that indicate the energy signature under the colored energy. It is just a method of identification or camoflage depending upon how you use it.
<br>
On symbols I have a tendancy to use a sacred symbol if there is very strong activity and have it change color. It also gives extra energy for the shields.

Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback on my question.
<br>
<br>
"You do not need to "maintain" a shield all of the time, plug it into kether (God), there is always energy there, and that is the vibration you are looking for. (I think, anyway)."  Ides315
<br>
<br>
Thanks mate that is absoulutly brilllant advice! Such a logical and simple thing I had not even considered! With all of the Middle Pillar work Ive been doing lately this should be easier than ever.
<br>
<br>
Something I find very interesting that a few of us have touched on,  is programing shields to do fairly complex things. As mentioned in responce to my earlier question there is no reason that i cant program a shield to allow full access to certain people or certain incomming emotional interaction.
<br>
<br>
Regarding vibratory rates, I imagine that you would want a high vibratory rate because most negs exist on lower ones. Is it as simple as this?
<br>
<br>
One thing I have tried before is rather than using a normal shield as such is considering my aura itself to be a sacred space that can not be crossed by negativity. I see the whole aura as the brightest white and use a self affirmation such as "This is my sacred light that may not be crossed by that which intends to harm me. This is my holy space". I guess its the same thing as shielding with a different twist, its actually a rather invigorating to do this, it leaves you feeling like you you have just done a session of energy work. I think it would work well after the LBRP if you were in a heavy situation where you were doing a lot of protection work.
<br>
<br>
Anways once again thanks for the feedback
<br>
<br>
best regards
<br>
<br>

Hey, Fenris.
<br>
<br>
You want a very high vibration rate. Check out the link Nita mentioned. I learned a lot of what I am sharing from information that came from there. The bright light seems to have an effect ot me, and could be part of the whole package, but feels like it is just a detterent, not a major blockage. Something determined will probably ignore it more or less, and just deal with the "bad taste" it creates. I do not know how to describe the vibration rate I was taught. I was let feel it, and went from there. It is extremely "excited", and causes a reaction in my energy body if to close. It makes me think of zig-zag patterns layered up, and each one vibrating at a blurring speed.
<br>
<br>
Good luck
<br>

<section>
reiki master: try burning them out. you use energy, right? focus as much of that energy into your stomach, then cut off your connection to your source of external energy (so there is no possibility of backlash and you can concentrate on only one thing instead of two) and then have the energy burn out everything from your spirit. i warn you that this should hurt spiritually: a lot. it may even hurt physically depending on how much energy you use and how you burn it.
<br>
<br>
burn the entire area of your energy and spirit to destroy anything that feels "funny" (anything that feels like it isn't a part of you or your aura or your energy.). a "neg" might be able to disguise itself so that it feels like it is part of you, so start burning everything that feels even the least bit suspicious, and stop burning it if you feel it hurting you while not hurting something else as well. when you are burning things that are attached to you spiritually, it may hurt you spiritually as well, which is why you have to keep your perception open to feel if something else is in pain as well.
<br>
<br>
if you think you have a spirit-guide/guardian-angel/something-like-that, tell it to get away from you when you are doing this so that it doesn't get burned and so that it also doesn't mess with your sensing of other beings.
<br>
<br>
and on a side note: if you use this method to affect your physical body you should be able to destroy things that are physically ailing you (but the pain will be much more physical in nature and will probably be more intensified. so use caution.) i have only used this method twice because i have only needed to use it twice. the first time i burned out absolutely everything from my system, including the cold virus that is supposedly undestroyable (but the very next day i caught the cold with a vengance because my immune system was unprepared (first day in my life where i was actually bed-ridden not by choice)). and the second time i used it i almost did the same thing until i realized i was getting rid of the cold virus; i stopped before getting rid of all of it, but it still came back fairly hard the next day and took nearly two weeks for a full recovery. and i don't get sick very often (once every year or two).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
sahlyn: "My question then is 'If someone got close enough to you so as to be within this boundary (say a psi vampire sat next to you on the bus) would they then be free to feed away on your energy, no matter how solid your shield was?" move your shield. the shield is not an inflexible thing unless you design it so and never change its design. if you don't make it rigid, then you you should be able to move it by simple mental or spiritual command.
<br>
<br>
<br>
ides: "Can you make the direct connection to divinity?" yes, but i have cut myself off from that power, for a reason which i would rather not disclose.
<br>
<br>
"I am pretty unknowledgeable about your sources of energy, but I get from your posts that it is more like a "life force" thing than anything else." that is pretty much most of it.
<br>
<br>
"There are ways to tap into constant energy, where you only need to check things, and expend a very small part of your own energy (maybe none at all) to maintain the shield." unfortunately, in calgary there isn't much energy at all, even in the areas of "high" concentrations of energy. so this isn't a very good idea for this location. otherwise, that is what i probably would do if i shielded.
<br>
<br>
"I am sure there are people that know ways that suit your system better, but I would recomend the Qabbilistic Cross to you. If you got this down, you should be able to overcome a lot (or all) of the energy starvation problems you encounter. Plus this can be used to channel continous energy into things like shields." thanks for the advice, and i will look into the qabbalistic cross thing, but i don't think i will be using it. i am very certain that my time in calgary is supposed to happen so that i get three things out of it: the first being greater control over my power at low levels so that i will be used to it and so that when i go back to having lots of energy i will be even more powerful than i currently am; the second being a greater understanding of why i should not get "power-mad" or "power-hungry"; and the third is actual control over dark ki because that is one of the most powerful forms of energy that i have yet encountered and i am very certain that i will be using it in certain times, meaning i will have to be able to control it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
tracy: "And what about those attacks that you aren't even aware of causing damage to your chakras and energy systems and other vital areas." i am aware of myself very keenly so i don't have to worry about this. but i can see how this would apply to others and is definately a good argument as to why one should shield.
<br>
<br>
"Since shields are made of positive energies". also, while i am sure that many people like to use "positive" energy to create/maintain their shields, a shield does not have to use positive energy. if i had greater control over the dark ki i am sure i could make an incredibly powerful shield out of that. and i also know that many people use shields made out of neutral energy (neither positive nor negative) because most peoples' "personal" energy is neutral-ish and many people use their personal energy to create shields.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
shielding techniques are many and varied. but i still like to feel my environment and act in accordance with it than to shut myself off from it out of fear or paranoia.    but that's just me!

Hey, kakkarot
<br>
<br>
I do not know what you are doing, and I understand personal things that are preferred not shared. I would have a long hard think about cutting off  your connection with divinity. I mean that as serious as anything I have ever said. Skip the Qabbilistic cross, it is a form of that link. Turns you into more of a conduit actually, but it can be modified to intake.
<br>
<br>
Shields do not need to isolate you. They can be about as complex and variable as you want them. Some people set them up as warning, only. Then they decide what to do with what is incoming.
<br>
<br>
Take care of yourself man.

Hi Stephan
<br>
You are right in the fact that shields or wards are what you make of them. It is nice to know that with a little bit of research and practice everything that you care about and love can be protected.
<br>
Anyone else that has more links upon shields could mention them also. If you have trouble visualizing make a model and use saran wrap and a frame to make it where you can energize where you want wards around yourself, your home, your vehicles and anything else you want to protect.

Hey, all
<br>
<br>
This is a long one. Here is one of the articles I found when I started researching, many moons ago. I do not remember the source, but have included the author, etc... Though it is geared from a psi perspective, and (to me) is a little cryptic, there is some very useful stuff in it. Enjoy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
[      Subject: Psi Shields..]
<br>
[ Performed by: Eu'ohara.....]
<br>
-------                              -----------------
<br>
<br>
Psi shields are structures constructs of the
<br>
mind, the mind requires focus and concentration.  The
<br>
nature of psi shields is such that it inhibits violation
<br>
and modification of psi energy fields and chakra
<br>
points.  These alterations can take place via magic, psi
<br>
attack, negative residue, et al.  There is usually some
<br>
intention that wields energy against another force.
<br>
This intention is what causes the deliberation and
<br>
invasion.  What the psi shield is accomplishing is to
<br>
extrapolate the energy field that is directed by the
<br>
intention into harmless free-flowing energy.  Usually,
<br>
if the psi shield is coupled with thought patterns that
<br>
are regulated by the Light Forces and/or energy patterns
<br>
that are founded by the ultimate power of the universe
<br>
(noted here) which is LOVE, then the force depletes
<br>
itself into nothingness yet an equally calibrated energy
<br>
construct is redirected upon the source... FOR.. "What
<br>
thou sends out wilt thou also experience in return" is a
<br>
motto well learned and well adhered to..
<br>
<br>
There is a misnomer with the concept of the psi
<br>
shields.. many construct it as a dome or fielding which
<br>
surrounds the being.  The strongest psi shield is one in
<br>
which takes root within the universe and extrapolates
<br>
upon itself, this is the psi shielding of the 4th
<br>
Chakra, the Heart Chakra..  One moved by Love centers
<br>
the entire universe as a radiate supernal thing.  There
<br>
is no need for protection for like will always attract
<br>
like, perceptions need be clear.  That is all we can say
<br>
on the matter within regards of what psi shields are and
<br>
their nature.  As for their construct we offer some
<br>
suggestions on an almost limitless option criterian.:
<br>
<br>
There is no psi shield of the 7th level for at
<br>
this attainment one realizes the impracticality of
<br>
shields...
<br>
<br>
Psi Shield of the Mind, make use of the 6th
<br>
Chakra, it serves to deflect all energies which are
<br>
based on lower structures (usually impassioned beings
<br>
who pursue ignoramous goals).  Focus the field of the
<br>
chakra around and about the body making use of the
<br>
vitality and energy characteristic of the being which is
<br>
unique.
<br>
<br>
Psi Shield of the Will, make use of the 5th
<br>
Chakra, it serves to countereffect force with force...
<br>
If the root is pure then the force is strong.  Negative
<br>
is neutralized with positive.  NEVER use like on like or
<br>
you will produce a vector field that is triunary by
<br>
nature.  We only make caution of this when using
<br>
negative energy.  Negative energy produces the triunary
<br>
vector or force which counters and overpowers all of the
<br>
sources energy and lets loose a repulsive effect on all
<br>
concerned.  The positive psi shield isn't really a
<br>
shield per say but a vitality imbiber.  It causes
<br>
oneself to be imbibed with vital motionary energy.  This
<br>
is more geared in healing.  Negative is life sapping,
<br>
this is where the triunary force
<instead creation="" of="">
 <br>
 propagates deterioration.
 <br>
 <br>
 Psi Shield of the Heart, make use of the 4th
 <br>
 Chakra, it serves to not only negate the initial field
 <br>
 but to cause transformation in the source that sent it.
 <br>
 This is one which we specified roots itself centerpieced
 <br>
 within the universe.  This made use of will potentially
 <br>
 harmonize beings found in discord.  As well as dissipate
 <br>
 the intention and the energy driven by intention into
 <br>
 free-flowing energy.
 <br>
 <br>
 Psi Shield of the pure force, make use of the 3rd
 <br>
 Chakra, it serves to Overpower force.  This is the focal
 <br>
 point of power and its determination without awareness
 <br>
 and consciousness is based in pedastaling it's nature
 <br>
 and seeing itself as the grandiose overbeing.  It is the
 <br>
 bare essence of force, if misdirected well ... the
 <br>
 outcome always is grim.  We only serve to warn you of
 <br>
 it's nature via an addage that goes as follows:
 <br>
 "With Great Power Comes Great responsibility,"
 <br>
 "Abdigate that responsibility,"
 <br>
 "And Be consumed by the power."
 <br>
 BUT should the shield be used in its proper form
 <br>
 it is to rebuke the original sources intent and energy
 <br>
 sending it back.  It does not serve well the forces of
 <br>
 revenge and avenge.  It serves well those who wish to
 <br>
 keep things in check.
 <br>
 <br>
 Psi Shield of the 2nd and 1st charka is knwon as
 <br>
 the Psi Shield of Essence.  It's base is that of nature
 <br>
 and differences.  If used properly it serves to surround
 <br>
 the being in an impenetrable wrap that excludes itself
 <br>
 of the subtle energy fields which is what is most
 <br>
 commonly used against other beings.  It's binding force
 <br>
 is the pure essence of itself as a characterized
 <br>
 individual with the inherent right to BE.  If used
 <br>
 improperly, it not only shields the individual but
 <br>
 isolates the individual from growth and development.
 <br>
 The shield should not be maintained but used only at
 <br>
 times when the core essence is required to rebuke
 <br>
 offensive and disruptive energy caught within it's
 <br>
 stratospheric surroundings.
 <br>
 <br>
 The order I gave this to you is based on my
 <br>
 inherent suggestion as to what to use.  The first is the
 <br>
 best, the last is the no-alternative type thing.  It
 <br>
 parallels the conceptualizations of the martial arts
 <br>
 warrior..  THe motto of life preservation..
 <br>
 <br>
 Rule #1, avoid fight at all costs.
 <br>
 Rule #2, if Rule 1 is nondoable, then hurt the
 <br>
 opponent and revert back to Rule #1.
 <br>
 Rule #3, if Rule #2 serves no deterence to the
 <br>
 fight, cause pain and revert back to
 <br>
 Rule #1.
 <br>
 Rule #4, if Rule #3 serves no deterence,
 <br>
 disenable the opponent and revert to
 <br>
 Rule #1.
 <br>
 Rule #5, if Rule #4 serves no deterence, THEN and
 <br>
 only then eliminate the opponent.
 <br>
 <br>
 As you will note, the extreme case of
 <br>
 no-alternative is used at the end.  The HIGHEST form is
 <br>
 the first.  Not many realize this and many easily forget
 <br>
 rule #1 and move down to rules 2,3,4 and some even to
 <br>
 5.  They allow their ego's and their ignorance to speak
 <br>
 for them versus their intelligence and wisdom, such is
 <br>
 the sorry state of affairs.
 <br>
 <br>
 With that I end this trance mission.  I hope it
 <br>
 has assisted you in discovery of psi shields, actually
 <br>
 shields of any sort attributed to the mind.
 <br>
 <br>
 Peace and Awareness, Love and Light,
 <br>
 Always on to forever,
 <br>
 Be.

G'day folks!
<br>
<br>
Shielding is a great idea, if you are the type of person who is internested in practicing magic or metaphysics and likes to take precautions.  Most people, however, are just interested in reading and or chatting about this out of interest, because its an interesting subject.  Shielding is the ideal solution to protect against many kinds of psy or neg attacks.  But it takes months of time and effort for a novice to create even modest shielding. Creating shields to protect against stronger negs like demons takes a great deal of knowlege and skill, which means years of serious study and work.
<br>
<br>
The majority of people will not do any preventative work. This is a fact. Here I am talking about the bulk of humanity, and not magical practitioners of any level. Most people just want to get on with their lives and not be bothered by Negs, eg, the average mom or dad who are generally very busy and lacking in free quiet time. It might sound a simple solution to spend an hour a day for a few months building a basic shield, but many people don't have a spare quiet hour per day free to prepare for something they hope and/or believe will never happen. Therein lies the problem.
<br>
<br>
My book, Practical Psychic Self-Defense, was written primarily for the average mum or dad who suddenly finds they have a wierd problem on their hands. It gives them effective countermeasures that can be used immediately without months of training.
<br>
<br>
When you come under a psychic attack, or are invaded by a negative entity, this is often so traumatizing and unbalancing that it is difficult to function. If you have ever suffered a major attack you will understand.  If you have not, count your blessings.  A sudden direct attack makes new shield creation impractical for anything but placebo purposes.
<br>
<br>
The average neg attack lasts about a month and then ends when the negs involved have done what they planned. This is way too short, especially given the disturbed environment a neg attack creates, to create any kind of shield.
<br>
<br>
For the average person, or even the advanced mystic, witch, shaman or magician, an allopathic technique like crossing running water can be a godsend if they are suddenly caught off guard.  Some may laugh at the simplicity of this method and decry its effectiveness, but this criticism will 'never' come from hard experience.  Its easy to poo poo such ideas and say 'don't use these silly methods, just spend a few hundred hours building a shield and nothing will be able to get to you", but this is obviously an impractical statement of expected perfection given the willingness of the general public to take such precations.
<br>
<br>
The fact of life here is that most people in the modern world want a quick solution, one they can use if and when a problem arises. Even if such a person comes under a major attack, once its over they'll usually not put any effort into preventative measures like psi shielding. Modern medicine has the same problem trying to convince people to eat and exercise better to improve their health.  They might do this during a health crisis, but after its over they'll usually go back to their old sedentary ways.
<br>
<br>
Everyone is of course entitled to their opinion...but some evidence to support negative statements and criticism of my work, or the work of others, would add a nice touch of philosophical honesty to this forum. Just saying that you think your way is better will not cut it.
<br>
<br>
Please trust me one-and-all when I say that the running water method is 'extremely' powerful and will stop the vast majority of negs cold, even a major demon if the volume of water is high enough.  Sure, advanced negs may wait for another opportunity to attack, but the initial attack will have been broken. This provides a little spiritual peace and quiet time to take further precautions.
<br>
<br>
And please keep in mind that shielding will not totally block out attacks, especially strong or advanced attacks. It makes it harder for the attacker to get inside and hurt or influence victims, and it reduces attack symptoms, but it will not stop the actual psi or neg attack.  I know many cases, including my own experiences, involving advanced metaphysical/magical practitioners, with rock solid shields generated over many years, coming under attack from very powerful negative entities, including major demons. Shields help, but will not stop this level of attack.  Other methods are required, eg, some form of effective banishment or other way to break an attack.  But if you don't know an effective banishment method, running water and etc make good emergency options.
<br>
<br>
I would also like to point out another factor, and that is that if an attack cannot reach the intended victim, it will be deflected onto the people around the victim, eg, family and friends. These will be influenced to cause problems and disharmony to unbalance the shielded victim and make them more vulnerable.  This is one of the reasons, I think, that metaphysically and spiritually advanced people generally live alone, or need to spend a lot of time alone.
<br>
<br>
I work in this field full time and have done for many years, and help people with a variety of neg attack problems on a daily basis, both hands on and through email consulting.  I have gathered a significant amount of data and experience.  I simply do not use or recommend methods that do not work, or that are impractical for the average person.  Other methods may sound great in theory, and may work in the hands of skilled practitioners, but if they don't work in real life or are too complex and demanding for the average person then I toss them aside and stick to what I know works at that level.
<br>
<br>
Please note that there are many books on medium to advanced magical types of defense available today.   But there is only one written specifically to cater for the needs of the average person: Practical Psychic Self-Defense.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

G'day/night all. Just wanted to say a few sentences here in regards to what Robert said about shielding and using running water to stop neg attacks. I mostly wanted to try to help back up what he's said. Running water and shielding does work and has worked successfully for me nearly evertime I've felt that I might've been under a psychic or neg attack of sorts.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes for no reason at all, whenever I suddenly come down with some kind of sickness or uneasyness, I've turned on the faucet and held my hands over the running water for a few minutes and have also combined this with visualizing white light around myself. This kind of thing actually does work. Disbelieve Robert and I all you may like, but if you've ever experienced a psychic or neg attack of any kind, wouldn't you think to try something fast that just might work?

Hey, all.
<br>
<br>
I also have to back Robert up. I am probably guilty of not employing his techniques as much as I should, and trying to make things to complex. I have direct experience with the water crossing method, have (and do) use music and mantras, prayers, and many other things he has mentioned. Slipping on things now and then, I have seen and felt immediate reactions when I put them back in place.
<br>
<br>
Sorry Robert, I cannot argue against you

Hi Robert -
<br>
<br>
Having your heartfelt experientially based sincere assertions and beliefs  argued with and negated is a frustrating exercise.
<br>
<br>
I have actually experienced something that really felt like acute onset neg activity while on water.  In my boat on running water, after jumping in the water, and  crossing water.  Lake Roosevelt Washington to be exact while on a camping trip with my family this summer.
<br>
<br>
If I am right - then I'm dealing with something that can piggy back across water or has become part of me - or that is me, and not a neg  - my husband too.
<br>
<br>
I am wondering if after experiencing years of a  long-term entrenched neg problem, if what an individual is "conditioned" for can't function on its own through those conditioned behavior patterns - like a system that has been "magnetized" for so long that it holds its pattern - like a tape casset that has been recorded over and over and over such that the imprint maintains its integrity for extended periods of time.... and if a person were to try to erase it (with water)  that the erasure would not establish itself with "integrity" would not "stick" because the tape material itself is degraded - full of "magnetic holes".
<br>
<br>
Or - what if the process of erasing created conditions of catharsis - an expunging of behavioral and emotional energy that functions and articulates itself according to its design - when it comes up to be purged it looks and feels like the program.  After all, matter does not disintigrate into non-existance, it goes through transitions and dissipates into more loosely held together forms - like how ice becomes vapor.
<br>
<br>
Just some quizzical thoughts.

Hi  Everyone
<br>
I was just interested in getting a good description of shields. Crossing over running water is a type of shield albeit not one personally made. Herbal wards are also a shield including incenses such as sulfur and chilli peppers. Anything would leave after that! I just took the persons opinion as just that and forgot it.
<br>
I figure most of those  opinions will shatter once someone comes up against something that is really negative. I have noticed a lot of people who sound that way don't have as much experience as they want everyone to think they do.  On long entrenched neg problems most of the time it happens because the victim has something negative to attach too. The victim has to change that even after the neg is gone or they may draw in the same problems again.
<br>
The hardest thing to do is to figure out  the what , when and where and apply it to yourself.

<section>
G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
I must make a clear definition concerning running water countermeasures.
<br>
<br>
1. Crossing running water will break any Neg attack, as long as the attacking Neg has not achieved 'hitchhiker' or 'overshadowing' status.
<br>
<br>
2. Lengthy exposure to a significant quantity of running water will weaken attached and hitchhiking Negs, and if continued for long enough will break attachments and evict resident Negs.
<br>
<br>
3. Exposure to running water plus visualization, as per PPSD, say by standing under a shower or atop many coils of garden hose gushing water, will break a Neg attack, and will also break manifestations of attached Negs.
<br>
By this I mean that if an attached or possessing Neg is trying to manifest through its host (the victim) and they carry this procedure out, it will drain the manifesting Neg and stop it manifesting.  This will not actually exorcise such a Neg, but it will stop it taking control (full possession) at that time and weaken it to the point where it cannot do anything major for some time.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, just taking a boat ride will not remove an attached Neg. A couple I have been helping with serious Neg attachment problems recently went on a 6 day boat trip on a river.  While on the boat, the symptoms of possession and Neg influence were greatly reduced, but did not stop entirely. When they got off the boat at the end of the trip, the Neg related problems returned full force.
<br>
<br>
Now one would logically think that such exposure to running water would evict any possessing entity. But this obviously does not work.  We don't know enough about the energies we are working with here, so much experimentation is needed. I suspect that the trick is, for evicting an attached entity, involves an unknown interaction between the surface of the earth and running water.
<br>
<br>
In my case, when I freed myself of major possession (see PPSD for the full story), I spent a week in the hills sleeping on the ground directly above an underground stream of potable water.  Apart from fasting, (which I have proven will not remove an attached Neg), the main ingredients in my release were that I was sleeping on the ground, in the dirt, above a large quantity of moving potable water, eg, clean and drinkable water moving beneath me.
<br>
<br>
The conditioning and damage that KB speaks of is an important factor to realize.  To truly take oneself out of the reach of Negs, one must remove the internal factors and weaknesses that are attracting Negs and/or allowing them to influence and/or interfere.  This is an ideal solution, but only really works for adults who have the intellect and willingness to undertake such work.  Children, especially babies, are outside the reach of this equation.  However, if parents of Neg effected children undertake this work, problems will be greatly eased, if not solved, for their children.
<br>
<br>
I have long suspected that parents problems generate many of their children's problems, eg, 'the sins of the fathers are passed on to their children, and their children's children's children, etc'.  So, logically, apart from using sensible countermeasures as necessary, the ideal long term solution would be for parents to undertake inner work to restore their mental and spiritual balance.
<br>
<br>
However, the problem is that if parents do not have any noticeable Neg problems, they are more likely to seek an alopathic remedy for their children's problems, rather than undertake any inner work for themselves. This is because the cause and effect of Neg related problems are often unclear and difficult to identify.
<br>
<br>
The most direct method I have found to achieve such inner psychological and spiritual balance can be found in the early lessons given in Franz Bardon's book, 'Initiation Into Hermetics', especially the 'Soul Mirror' work.
<br>
<br>
I can boil this down into a nutshell by quoting the greatest single piece of advice every given:  "Man, know thyself."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

<section>
I read through the above postings with interest , and thought I would put my perspective forward  .
<br>
I've never  shielded  and unless things went badly wrong never will .
<br>
Having been born to a father with metaphysical interests ,its not as if this area is foreign territory and to date  there have only had two experiences which would make me rethink my stance. The first was a number of years ago while lying down, I heard a screaming coming towards me it was  terribly so I shielded my bed with white light, but it landed with a  bang  waking me. The second  was when I met a charismatic man called Mark ,on arriving home I thought what was his name. It was loudly shouted  at me from out of the air ,the only time that has ever happened  I later found out that he practised the black arts ,but he left my life without any  trouble.
<br>
As  Robert has written time is a factor and to maintain sheilds every  day  would drive new crazy. I was also told   by a teacher that as we grow so does our inner light ,this shines from us protecting  and pushing away anything that is foreign to our vibration.

I'm just wondering what effect does essential oils have on shielding along with the N.E.W meditation?  I've been trying agarwood from india and helichrysum which is known to enhance oxygen to brain and cerebral function I swear I've been having a lot of LUCID dreams.  One time however I think someone was invading my dream, I woke up in a virtual type OBE (not the real deal) and saw kid over my bed, then he took me to another room then it turned into a dream afterwards and showed me the person who was attacking other people (symbolically) and maybe this person was also attacking me, and when I woke up my whole body was very electric (usually I'd see lucid dreams if my body is energized like this).  What are the symptoms if someone is attacking your psi and you got your shields up so to speak, would the energy start flowing great around the body to ward off the attack?

Hey, all
<br>
<br>
I thought I should qualify my statement about "white light" shields. After reading Roberts post, and knowing some things, and thinking about others, a few things occur to me.
<br>
<br>
As I understand it, "plain" white light is not sufficent for a shield. Robert talks about this in one of his articles available in the download area. The type of white light "brought down" in the middle pillar ritual is (I think) the correct kind. As i understand it, this is very good for making a shield from, and can be molded to fit the requirments of your own personal shield. I do not "see" colors, etc... so much as i fell them. At the time I was doing it that way, there was incoming psychic attacks, and my enviroment was anything but settled.
<br>
<br>
I did feel some things being detoured, so I probably had it right. Or partially so anyway. I also am in no way advanced at these things, only sharing my own personal experience, and the things that worked/did not for me. I have stated this before, and would hope that like myself, most (all) people would sift through the information offered, and find what is useful to themselves.
<br>
<br>
People that are truly interested in learning would do good to go to the download area and get the files put there by people that have been able to confirm thier information based on more than personal experience.
<br>
<br>
Take care, all.

Hi all...
<br>
I'm wondering about shielding. i've been doing it for several years and i do feel confident with shielding. it works for negative entities, but when you step into the arena with a demon - hell break loose. it happened that my shield shattered like glass, and all it did was looked at it. i then created a shield of thorns (my favorite counter defence), i guess that was a big mistake, since not only did it shattered it again, but drained my energy. anyways, i just wanted to add that shield holds to a certain point, but when dealing with much more powerful entites, then its not going to hold.
<br>
now a days i don't do shielding anymore. i found a buddhist mantra (in pali) called diamond armor. actually i didn't know what it was until i projected out of my body and found a void, i can't explain it. somehow i was shimmering, yet i do not exist. i thought it was an effect of the projection, until my some of friends projected, some looked with astral sight, and some scryed, and they confirm it during the time i was awake.
<br>
a dear friend channeled Gaia and higher entities to try to uncover me, they said it was not possible, since the mantra does not reside in the astral plane, but the causal plane.
<br>
cheers!

<section>
Hello All
<br>
You have to have a great deal of practice to build a shield that will slow down a major demon. The best thing is to use layers so that by the time it gets through the layers you are able to do something.
<br>
Shielding is good for everyday life. Protecting yourself from negative energies and  minor entities. It is also true that if you know yourself and your energy signature then you can cleanse anything out of your energy that has no intelligence. I like doing it in a swimming pool or water.
<br>
A good shield will not cut you off from anything except negative energy. It has to be combined with other working methods to keep yourself safe. Anything that keeps a entity from attaching to you quickly gives you the time to start banishing it or find some other countermeasure.
<br>
Essential oils help to raise the vibrations in your aura and make it harder for things to attach. Ground herbs that you put on your breast bone will also make it so your vibrations are raised. No one method is a cure all and divine energy will only enrage a entrenched neg unless you know how to unattach it and banish it.
<br>
The best thing is to learn counter measures and how to do things to prevent it from attaching or becoming entrenched in the first place.

Hi Kristen
<br>
I would say the best way is to  try to see the energy circulating around your hand. First you put your finger in it and try to hear a pitch. You keep trying until your do. You then look at your hand and try to touch the energies and you should hear notes. You then do the two together and you should get a melody of sounds that make up almost a muscial signature. It is your energy signature.
<br>
Another way is to go out of body and touch the energy around you. It should play all of the notes, pitches, and melodies that make up the essential you.
<br>
The third way is to meditatte. You will notice that anything not of you looks and feels differently than the rest of you. You push it out saying this is not me. If you don't know for sure ask for angelic or divine aid to push away something that isn't of you and banish it. You also state that if it is of you please help you to understand this.
<br>
You can clean out your chakras, your energy system, and note anything attaching to you with this system. If you notice something attaching to a point on your energy body then do Robert's core image removal exercise.

so the topic is "Why Not Just Shield?", but i started thinking, "Why Not Just Fight Back?".
<br>
<br>
it seems that most of the people who are talking about using shields seem to think that the shield stops any possibility of a fight dead in its tracks. but as Astrocio said, when he went up against a demon, his shields were worthless. so why not use the shields as they are used in the real world: a means of defense to allow you to counter attack? rather than just sitting inside your shield and hoping your shield will protect you, why not fight back as well? this is why i don't shield: i just attack the thing and then protect myself DURING the fights whenever i feel that i should protect myself.

<br>
"As I understand it, "plain" white light is not sufficent for a shield" ~Ides; i agree, i think the white light has to be an 'active' or radiant kind of light. for some reason i hold contempt for these kinds of shields. i think they are too defensive and they tend to make the person inert the confrontation. if something is attacking you, i don't think you should just defend against it once or twice when it attacks and then hope it will go away and never come back. i know they work (i've used them), but its like taking the easy way out, and you don't get any good combative experience out of the confrontation.

<br>
take a shower when you feel lousy; don't you feel good afterwards? even a cold shower feels good: but why? is it because it is getting rid of negs and combatting psychic/spiritual attacks for you, or is it just relaxing or invigorating your body? i don't know. but i think the running water shield has to do with the natural energy that it holds and carries with it, that prevents some spiritual being from 'crossing' it and helps deflect "negative" attacks. and also, when you take a shower, you body absorbs water (rehydrating itself) and that energy as well which are both good for you.

Hey, Astrocio, Care to share your mantra? If not, I understand completely. I am not interested in it for myself, so much as a few loved ones.
<br>
<br>
kakkarot, Wasssup man?!  I agree with you about hiding behind shields continually. I have also figured out in this confrontation that my aggresion is used against me to some extent (a rather large one at times). It is not to often (never?) that I get attacked now where I am in a good position to to "return the favor". At various times there have been attempts to draw me into combat, preferably while enraging me at the same time. It has the appearences of causing more damage to my "enemy" to hold a more passive position.
<br>
<br>
All that, and the power behind this is the most evil thing I have EVER felt. I have defeated it in battles, but the same tactic never seems to work again. The human behind this loses strength and wavers when I do not get into a "shoving match" with them. I have brought "reality" of their actions to them, which has caused a withdrawl more than once. I wish it could be handled with a "big stick" (I have a few), it is more complex than that. I think one of my lessons this time around is to find a different way.
<br>
<br>
If the psychic was correct about the history of this, I have tried the big stick before, and it always loops back to be re-done. I don't like doing things over (and over and over....) so it is time to finish it right.
<br>
<br>
You might even find a couple of useful things in here.

Hi Kakkarot -
<br>
<br>
You wrote "it seems that most of the people who are talking about using shields seem to think that the shield stops any possibility of a fight dead in its tracks. but as Astrocio said, when he went up against a demon, his shields were worthless. so why not use the shields as they are used in the real world: a means of defense to allow you to counter attack? rather than just sitting inside your shield and hoping your shield will protect you, why not fight back as well? this is why i don't shield: i just attack the thing and then protect myself DURING the fights whenever i feel that i should protect myself."
<br>
<br>
I think - and that means in my fallible opinion - that fighting back can get one into even more trouble than one is capable of handling - depending on one's own ability and what is actually attacking. Questions I've asked myself are what if the attack is originating from a person and that person doesn't really know what their thoughts are doing?  Or - what if a person were actually purposefully attacking and using a demon to do their dirty work and its much more powerful than you?  Or - what if what is attacking doesn't derive its impetus from a human mind in the first place - and is much more powerful than you?  Or - what if the attacker is the person's own dweller on the threshold and you end up fighting yourself in a sense?
<br>
<br>
I think its important to know exactly what it is that is attacking and why and how before making a decision to fight back - otherwise, you could end up hurting someone in ways you would not have chosen - or yourself.  A person could end up being involved in a retaliatory loop that feeds itself - and - which feeds a neg.
<br>
<br>
Another way to look at it is this - you could be providing reinforcement for a particular behavioral dynamic  (in a psychological sense) - a dynamic which involves the attacker and yourself - by paying attention to it and responding to it.  One excellent way to diminish the probability of being attacked is to not respond.  Its like when two year olds throw temper tantrums - sometimes if you try hugging  them or restraining  them to keep them from screaming and kicking, or spanking them,  the tantrum escalates to undesired proportions and you can end up expending energy in inefficacious ways, getting frustrated and irritated while trying  to get it to stop - and the toddler feeds off it and screams and kicks some more.  Three hours later you're ticked and drained and the toddler hasn't learned to control his own frustration.
<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that at the very least I would caution anyone that is considering fighting back to "study the enemy" from a safe place... and to study yourself.   Know what "it" is and why it is, how it is, and where it is coming from -  if at all possible.  Good generals know the weaknesses and strengths of thier own fighting forces and do their utmost to know that about the enemy.
<br>
<br>
If you can't gather information then shield yourself - shield yourself anyway - don't strike blindly/out of aggression/some sense of angst - because if you do, then you could be serving some purpose that you wouldn't agree with.
<br>
<br>
<br>

Hello Ides and Kristen
<br>
You are both right in that any energy you use to attack something can be used against you. If you don't want it done to you then you never do it to anyone else should be a magical rule.
<br>
On attacking demons. Anyone that can destroy a demon is not fighting a demon but a thought form. You attract what you put out and sooner or later everything you get around you will be attacking you back.

Sorry I've been away, I was having connection problems.
<br>
<br>
Ok--skin tight shields versus bubble shields.  If something damages your "aura", wait 5 minutes.  Your body generates the energy that makes it up, it has no permanent structures in it.  What you want to protect is your nervous system, and associated energetic systems, and those are inside your body.
<br>
If you make JUST a bubble shield, someone strong can come up and shake it  until you rattle, if you get my drift.
<br>
As for psychic vampires, it's hard to make any type of shield to completely block one of them.  Much of the time the best way to deal with that kind of attack is to fight back.  In the vast majority of cases, they're not interested in a fight and will look for an easier target.
<br>
<br>
Entrenched parasites--first, find out where they are, and track down all their little tendrils or attachment points.  Then, build a VERY strong shield around them, making sure you encompass the whole thing.  Draw the shield in so that they are forced into a sphere, and pull it out.
<br>
I've done plenty of these.
<br>
You can also hit the "main body" with controlled psi-blasts until it fragments, if the entity is too strong to lift otherwise--that will weaken or injure it enough to use the above method.
<br>
<br>
If you don't fight back, you're going to get beat up.  If you do fight back, sometimes you might get beat up, but probably less often.
<lol>
 <br>
 Yes, you do need a backup plan in case you come up against something that can get through or take out your shields.  However, you should be continually improving your shields.
 <br>
 You will learn to work through them--you know how you made them, your brain just has to get used to dealing with them....and it will, in less than a month, if you keep your shields up full time.
 <br>
 <br>
 As for how you charge your skin--the same way you'd charge your hand, just over your entire body.  Push energy into your skin, and encourage the nerves there to produce more energy.
 <br>
 You expected all this to be quick and easy?

Hi Winged Wolf -
<br>
<br>
What did you mean when you mentioned something strong coming along and shaking you in your bubble?
<br>
<br>
I'm curious because I frequently experience strong occillations and rumblings and other weird energetic sensations that I do not understand - as I'm sitting here now writing this as a matter of fact it feels like a small earthquake is going on.

Basically, if someone is strong enough, because the shield is generally "hollow" or less dense inside, they can shake it until a person's nervous system gets pretty well rattled.

Hey, all.
<br>
<br>
After reading some of these posts, and comparing it to what I have been doing, I have a couple of questions. Maybe I have it figured out.
<br>
<br>
I have removed several things attached to me that almost all feel like Winged_Wolf's description of the "bugs". The feeling of the "tendrils" (I think of roots) is quite strong, and most of the major ones had these running into my chakras. Specifically the heart, but pretty much all of them. They also primarily used my spine to access most of my body. I would guess that the core image work is still needed  to take care of what there primary attachment point was? I don't "process" the core images in accordance with Robert's description, but following the "issue" will usually take me to a "bug".
<br>
<br>
Of note, the first time I started to remove things, it was more like I could feel a forest of black, wicked, leafless, alive trees on/in my head. It was the first time my Kundalini had been awake in years, and I just went in and played Paul Bunyan (legendary lumberjack) with a sword and torch. There was a big forest.  A couple of the big ones could regenerate almost as fast as I could cut, so I would burn the cuts between swings to keep it from growing back. Though I had very few images to go with this, it relieved a LOT of the mental stress I was going through at the time.
<br>
<br>
OK, the second question. Is it possible for someone to put something on you that needs an outside food source if you do not generate enough negativity? My shielding is coming up, and as I construct them, I am cutting contacts. This in turn seems to be weakening a couple of things that are left on me, and allowing me to be able to find and attack them.
<br>
<br>
Any thoughts would be great.
<br>
<br>
Thanks, all
<br>
<br>

<section>
Hmmm....yes, it's possible for an entity to merely use you as a favored feeding stopover, as it were.
<g>
 It would generallly leave you, and go elsewhere during that time, though, rather than remaining attached to you.  Most of the entities that attach themselves seldom or never leave their host.  An entity that did leave, might "install" an anchor--an energy structure that it merely needs to dock with to link fully to you, rather than having to go through a complex linking process all over again.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, what seems most likely to me in your case is that as you bring up your shields and get to work, you're getting BETTER at this.  It's not that they are getting weaker, but instead that you are getting stronger.
 <br>
 Your description of the regeneration of the entities you were removing is precisely the reason you have to track down all the tendrils, if any, when you go to remove an individual spirit--if you've got them all, then you can be sure you're not leaving anything behind to regenerate.

Hi, Winged_Wolf.
<br>
<br>
Intersting. The "docking structure" makes me wonder a little bit. For months now I have been aware that 2 specific days out of the week caused depression in me. Always the same 2. I was able to do some other things that started disrupting links that had been made to me, before I got my (own) shields up. This caused a banshee type scream, for a while the first night, And one of the 2 days was no longer an issue. Since I have started shielding, the other day is not either. Though I did have an attack at midnight, right before the last one passed.
<br>
<br>
Whatever is still there, spell or entity, is persistent, and has atleast a limited amount of intelligence. I became fully aware of it a few days ago, when I was building shields around a family member, and some images intruded into my head, in an attempt to divert my attention. They where directly related to what had happened. I finished what I was doing, and chased after them. I found this thing in my belly/chest/forehead. I have encased it to some extent (actually, not knowing why or what I had done this instinctively about a day before your post on that), and have been sending energy at it to disrupt it.
<br>
<br>
The other thing about a docking structure, is that when I had my largest expulsion, there was a lot of physical with it. But one of the things I had noticed then, and forgotten over the many months that followed was It did not feel like everything left me that night. What was left was in the same area of what is still there. Of everything I have dealt with, that one was the strongest, it caused a dry hissing reaction as it came out. It did not come from my lungs, but (after gathering) mostly from my belly. It felt like I was going to vomit something alive, like a knot of worms (this was the mental image), or something from "Alien" (That is how it felt). All that came out, was a dry hissing, and terrible contortions of my face. And my tongue almost dislocated sticking out that far.
<br>
<br>
I am 1/2 guessing, but I heard it is not nice to tap on the side of a fish tank.
<br>
Thanks, though. Still learning. Don't have much patience with "tappers" right now, still need to work on the eyes.

Even shields are not 100% effective.
<br>
They were one of the first things I learned to construct when I began my occult studies.
<br>
Sometimes, things just slip through. Parasites are good at that. It's what they do.

I do have a sheild and  I re-charge it every month.

<section>
Hello Leyla
<br>
I think that shields are least effective when you are first learning. I also feel everyone should do a simple shield renewal every day. I do mine in the shower. Most shield failures happen because the person doesn't renew them often enough.
<br>
Everyone interprets things differently Ides so that could be why you see things shaped as bugs. It is not a docking structure so much as the things you have left in you. Roberts description of it attaching to the negative elements in your psyche is completely accurate.
<br>
If anything can rattle you around in your wards then you aren't doing it correctly. I speak from experience.  A shield that defends your mental  self, physical self and astral self is the only way to go.
<br>
Engry fluctuations are what normally causes the rfeeling of being rattled. You have to attach the wards to a proper energy source for this not to occur.
<br>
You can entrap and push things out with shields but this requires that you can identify your own energy and what is you. The core image removal is probably the most simple way to do it,

Hey, all
<br>
<br>
Interesting points about identifying what id you, and what is not. When I really work on it, it feels more like a fog, or some sort of 3D net in me. None of the attachments have really felt like "bugs". That is just my rating for them in the grand scheme. No sense in giving something more credit than it deserves. For a feel (to me) they feel like a cross between a maggot and an earthworm, with a root system (potential) that a Willow tree would be proud of.
<br>
<br>
I think part of the "misson" of what is left is to keep me from defending myself. I doubt I grew a whole bunch stronger the minute I built a shield (unless there was a LOT of drainage), but that is what made me almost instantly aware of it. One that is gone now, popped like a boil. Right after my first set of sheilds. What I am dealing with now came on as I started layering up, and sheilding others. It is trying to get negativity wherever it can, fighting for its pathetic little life. Excuse me, but I REALLY dislike this things.
<br>
<br>
Take care, all

I always just shielded them all, one at a time if necessary, and used a bit of force, or a "razor" construct to remove them from their attachement point.  You shield the main body first to help prevent it from sending out more tendrils while you track down the ones that are already there.

Hey, all.
<br>
<br>
I only started shielding them internally lately. It works well. Gave me the impression of starving them out. I have been using something like the razor method also. Unless it  is particularly well hooked, I have had a lot of success with (once it's located) just grabbing and pulling. Kind of like up rooting a tree by force. I us something like Winged_Wolf's razor method, or a blowtorch (Usually both) to get the ends of the tentacles to break loose. Some of the more ingrained ones can take days of work. Anything you can do to weaken them during this time is good. Robert has several methods.
<br>
<br>
For the last one I have been working on, I have gone out onto bridges, and attacked it while standing over running water. After the first time I did that, I swear I could feel it cringe at the thought of more sessions like that.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck

How does one know if they are being attacked by a neg? What are the signs? I don't think I really have problems with negs but I just want to be sure. I feel like they don't attack me. On the other hand, I don't think I've seen or encountered any entities at all, unless maybe in a dream. But even then just two or three of them. They were good entities though. I am certain I already instinctually know how to shield because of this, but do you think I'm giving something off that repels all entities?All I know is that my aura is green and it flashes purple. I've seen it with my own eyes (all three of them, my 2 physical and my 1 mind's eye). But I don't see anything radiating from my aura.

It can be difficult to tell what's caused by entities, and what's caused by other physical things.  For example, one person reported they had some minor aches and pains in areas where there were very small parasites attached.

Reading this topic i was so happy and relieved Robert Bruce responded on this one.
<br>
<br>
First comment, one way you can tell people who are experienced and have actually been through an attack versus those who are like any group who studies and "knows" on an intellectual level their way will work is humility.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who has ever been attacked (at least the first time one is attacked) on the physical level wil probably agree with one thing it is the most humbling experience you will ever go through.  I really believed i could visualize a shield, visualize God, make my energy strong enough to ward off an attack before it happened.  The ones here who spout "i dont bother wiht protection" or the ones who are saying "what's the problem I visualize a shield and nothing can harm me" are the ones you dont want to be getting advice from.
<br>
<br>
Trust someone who has been through it and the one reason I really respect and right away knew RB was legit was his practical proven methods that are apart from "shielding and visualization" because when you're attacked your ability to shield is shaken.  Of course lets hope the ones who dont bother protecting and the ones who know they can't be touched through their invincible shields never are really attacked by something strong enough to shake them.  That way they can know they're right.
<br>
<br>
Im sorry but i dont have patience for much of this lack of respect or real appreciation of the strength of these entities which many in these forums spout as some type of strong belief system along with practice of spiritual matters.
<br>
Dont ask questions like "why not just shield" you are then taking on the tone of the young skilled chosen one who has seen it all.  Just know we all have a lot to learn and maybe step down a few notches on the ego totem and respect maybe people who have dealt wiht these things for centuries as well as those who have fought them not just imagined them maybe know a little more.
<br>
<br>
One last point I personally worry about those around me more than myself.  This shield yourself thing is foreign to me in that I am not only worried about myself.  I am not going to get every loved one of mine and i didnt even try when we were under attack to train daily on energy work because it isnt' going to happen.  Roberts methods were the only way i could at least help preserve some of their energy and help them in every way i could from the outside.
<br>
<br>
If you are a father or mother only worried with shielding yourself or trusting your guru like powers to shield everyone and shunning anything more practical or proven then on your spirital path you might want to look at ego and the chosen one complex along with other paths.

<section>
One clarification I am not saying shielding isn't effective I would never imply a certain method isn't effective except for maybe the "show unconditional love to any negative being you encounter" philosophy due to the opening up dynamic.
<br>
<br>
However, I believe if a person is really serious and finds themselves in a situation where they are under attack and take the whole issue seriously they will use whatever method they know.  But never underestimate the importance of knowing many, just in case your resolve isn't as strong as you think when the sh1t really hits the fan so to speak.
<br>
<br>
I am very careful what kind of advice I give out,  and when i read advice that seems more self promotion and a kind of "look how far i am in my development i dont even need corny garlic" instead of genuine concern and thought out advice I can't help but comment.
<br>
<br>
Add what you can and help where you can but dont undermine anything that may be the one technique that a person might need when they are under attack.  Its fueled more by a desire to show you're right than it is a desire to ensure a person is able to survive an attack.

nice opening posts. very wise in saying that we should not be slamming techniques since others may need them. after all, not everyone can do everything. people should pick and choose what is important for their individual needs, and what is within the scope of their abilities.
<br>
<br>
however, with regard to the "being attacked" thing, you should also realize that not everyone is as powerful as each other. some of us are very weak and even weak negative entities can do damage. some of us are powerful enough to be able to take on minor demons one on one and have a rather interesting (or what i call fun

) fight.
<br>
<br>
for many the white light works, in fact it seems as though it is a natural opposite to many "bad" spirits out there. in some situations it doesn't work. just like with shields. some shields work some times (or most of the time), while no shield is good enough sometimes. it all depends on many variables in a person's life.

 The thing is, there are a lot of people who post on the board who have problems with very weak entities.....entities which would never bother to TRY to attack them if they had competant (not even great, just competant) shields.  And they don't just have problems once....they have problems repeatedly.  They don't learn their lesson after the first incident.  That's what I was complaining about.  I can't understand why anyone, after being attacked that way, wouldn't do what they can to start learning how to defend themselves.  It's like repeatedly walking through tick country without ever thinking to put on some Deet, then whining and complaining about all the ticks you picked up, and maybe getting some other person to pick the ones off your back for you.

now now winged wolf. not everyone on the planet is a powerful and skilled energy user. i would even venture to guess that most people think that even weak shields are fairly difficult.
<br>
<br>
but i understand what you're saying: after training myself in the martial arts for a few years i had problems understanding why others were so weak compared to me. i had grown up being a wimp, but after having to start integrating with society again, it took me months to realize that i was stronger than i thought i was, and stronger than others too. and that still amazes me, how weak most people are when they really don't have to be.
<br>
<br>
but, then again, why would people need to be strong in north america's cushy, luxurious society? i mean, after all, people live in absolute comfort these days, with no worries about how to survive, so why should they be bothered to become strong in anything? their opinion (btw, i am not neccessarily picking out anyone on these forums or not on these forums, but at the generalness of society these days) is that medical science will keep them healthy, and death isn't even considered by most people now a days until it happens to someone near them. i guess my response should just as easily go in the philosophy forum as much as it should be a response here, but oh well.

Hey, kakkarot
<br>
<br>
Just as a thought, most of it does not come easily for the majority of people. These people can still have neg problems though. What some of us can achieve in a few months might take others several years, and vice versa. I would bet they were people every bit as dedicated as you in their pursuit of martial arts, but the progress they achieved was not equal.
<br>
<br>
Having read a lot of your posts, and having gone through my own experiences and learning curves, some of us just have an edge. In my philosophy, there is a reason for it.
<br>

As a comparison, I know people that have learned controlled conscious astral projection when they were 20 yrs old, without training. They located their guides almost immediately. From your posts, neither you nor me can do that, but these same people have no magickal abilities (psi, qi, whatever...) that they have really figured out how to develop.
<br>
<br>
Just something to keep in mind. In a lot of ways, I find it a hinderence in trying to show someone else, because my only explanation is just DO IT.
<br>
<br>
And yes it is nice and cushy in north america (well parts, anyway), but that just gives one more time and tools to take care of other business.

Jeez, kakkarot, you don't want to fight about it ;-p
<br>
<br>
The indiviidualism of magick (all forms, loose description) is what makes people better, as it is a highly personal thing. It is what made me look so long and so hard, and review a lot of different systems, including psi. If you can sift through the pieces, a (sort of) common framework becomes obvious. Even this is personal, as we all have different conclusions about this framework.
<br>
<br>
Just never close yourself of to other ideas, as one can learn something from almost everyone.
<br>
<br>
Best.
<br>
<br>
P.S. If you start shielding and helping a lot of people, you had better be good, as it will draw a lot of attention to you.

I appreciate your response winged wolf and understand the distinction you were trying to make.
<br>
<br>
My response was aimed more at the one or two people i've seen on this forum who in their own way seem to imply attacks are the persons fault either cus they're weak in shielding or afraid.  These entities exist outside of us and i dont think we know enough about them to really say "they'll only attack if ... "
<br>
I see now what you mean about the astral wildlife and lower forms.
<br>
<br>
Is it true though that trying to shield others and protect them will make you a target even more?  It seems the ones im concerned about ar becoming more isolated from me now that im more aware of outside forces.  Im very careful not to be invasive and the measures i take are really passive so im pretty sure its not because im more "in their face"
<br>
<br>
I wonder how this works although I do know RB stated somewhere people you have energy problems with will probably fade to the background while you're working on this stuff.

<section>
well, goingslow, how are you shielding them? some shields will cut off the emotional attachments that humans kindof need (being the socialistic animals that we are), which could result in them becoming more introverted.

Hello Going Slow
<br>
I do a lot of shielding of other people. Entities need to be banished after they are kept away from people. I can do this at a distance but Robert has things to do this in his book. Negative forces that are being sent at someone are normally when the person who shields others is targeted.
<br>
I agree on knowing all sorts of methods is the best way to go. It expands your knowledge. It is also true that alot of people here have ways to do things that they think are best. It is a individual art so do what works best for you and the others that you are helping.
<br>
I can truthfully say that shielding is a worth while thing to do. It has to be done correctly and nothing can cause the harm to others that you are helping or yourself.
