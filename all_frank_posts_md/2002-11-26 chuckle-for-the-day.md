<br>
Two men are waiting at the gates of heaven and strike up a conversation.
<br>
<br>
"How'd you die?" the first man asks.
<br>
<br>
"I froze to death," said the second.
<br>
<br>
"Gee that's awful. How does it feel to freeze to death?"
<br>
<br>
"Initially it's very uncomfortable. First you get the shakes. Then you get pains in your fingers and toes. But eventually it's a very calm way to go. You get numb, after which you kinda drift off. Just like if you were sleeping. How about you, how did you die?"
<br>
<br>
"I had a heart attack. You see, I knew my wife was cheating on me. So, one day, I showed up at home unexpectedly but found her alone watching TV. I ran all around the house looking for her lover but could find no one. As I ran up the stairs to the attic, I had a massive heart attack and died."
<br>
<br>
"That's so ironic."
<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"
<br>
<br>
"If you had only stopped to look in the freezer, we'd both be still alive."
<br>
