Anyone know of other BBS forums that mainly specialise in obe?
<br>
<br>
I'm not looking for any negative tosh. Just plain and simple obe experiences and/or how people can work towards having them... but mainly with members that are *already* engaged in the process of obe.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Greetings Frank , I'm on the mailing list of the link below, it deals in main with lucids in a very methodical approach. The emails i've recieved to date are interesting but out of my scope at this stage.
