Hi,
<br>
<br>
I'd just like to say I am really happy to find forums such as these. I have been really interested in the idea of Astral projection fro some time now and I have read quite a lot of stuff on it. I want to introduce myself to everyone here, i know I'll find these forums a great place to learn more stuff and to meet people on the same wavelength as me!

hello-
<br>
<br>
To get started read the FAQ's, Permanent Astral Topics, and everything by Frank, Major Tom, Gandolf, and other moderators.  They will help you immensely.  Oh, and Frank has a book coming out, so be on the look out.
