Hello all,
<br>
I am new to this message board. I am a 31 year old woman, I am a Pagen Witch. I am always working on bringing myself closer to the Divine. I try my best to meditate often. I have recently started working with Tai Chi. This looks like a good board to talk and learn from others who are working on increasing personal energy/spirituality. I am looking forward to reading and participating on future posts.

Hi and welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
We are mainly to do with astral projection here but perhaps you will find things of interest. All the best anyway.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hi Rodi,
