<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
Just  was wondering as you do, if it was dangerous at all.
<br>
I'm only 13 and i was wondering if OBE's were affected by people age at all.
<br>
Also, what it you get stuck when you project and you can't come back?
<br>
How do you get back?
<br>
Just scared lol

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The only "danger" in all this is if you read the blurb pushed out by all the mystics who love to generate hysteria surrounding the concept of psychic attack. To me, their strategy appears to be scare people sh*tless... so they actually begin to have these scary experiences.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, within Focus 2 of consciousness (which is where virtually ALL beginners start doing their "astral projecting") there is a foundation rule that says as-you-think-then-so-it-becomes. Thought equals action in other words. This is obvious really, as you are actually within your very own individual area of mind. I was one of the forerunners of this research here and I, myself, many years ago, spent almost 5 years fighting every devil and demon that ever existed... until the penny finally dropped.
<br>
<br>
But the doom and gloom-style mystics don't tell you this because either 1) they simply do not know or 2) their little "scam" 'aint gonna work because people will start to put two and two together, when it comes to the sting, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
Now, considering what I have said above, look at it from the other direction. If you can actually
<i>
 convince
</i>
someone there are dangers, then they will actually start to perceive those very same dangers!
<br>
<br>
However, these people will not then turn around and say,
<i>
 "Ha ha, I 'aint falling for that trick! You put the belief in my mind and caused it!"
</i>
Nope, they are gonna believe that the mystic/guru was right. They are not going to view these unpleasant situations as their own mind-created reality that has actually been formed from their very own subscription to the belief that has been implanted into them by the mystic or guru. As I say, they are going to rally around that mystic/guru thinking he is god's gift to projection-danger solutions. So, if that mystic/guru happens to have some kind of book for sale that claims to be able to rid a person of these "dangers" then the person in question will buy it right away. And there, in my opinion, is the fraud. What let's these mystics/gurus off is no one can actually prove it in a court of law. If anyone could actually find some way of proving it, many of these mystics and gurus would end up in jail for perpetuating psychic fraud.
<br>
<br>
It's a seedy, horrid situation that has actually been taking place for thousands of years from what I can see. In the early days, it appears to have been used to scare people into compliance with the ruling regime. Anyone not falling into line would be dunked as a "witch" or burnt at the stake, or whatever. Nowadays, it is used as a method of creating a "following" and extracting money from people. No matter what belief you instil in a person, they will perceive it. So some mystics/gurus follow the psychic-attack style of route (fear is an extremely powerful suppression and/or compliance tool) and others try more subtle avenues like being closer to god, and all that jazz.
<br>
<br>
The core element to bear in mind is that the mystic or guru only has to get you convinced initially so you believe it and therefore perceive it. Then the person doing the perceiving will think the mystic/guru is right. So they start believing that particular mystic/guru even more, and become open to even more suggestions by the mystic/guru in question. So they will perceive this even more and they become even more open to their suggestions! And so they believe it more, and so on and so on... before they know it they are completely hooked. But they don't actually realise they've been hooked, and that's the nature of psychic fraud.
<br>
<br>
These mystics and/or gurus tend to prey on the more vulnerable in society.
<br>
<br>
Young people a little lost in life wanting "direction" or a person may have had a few really scary projection experiences, and they get fearful thinking they need some kind of "protection". These mystics/gurus specialise in preying on the more vulnerable. For example, I saw a TV program a while ago where members of a paedophile-style sect would look around railway stations in major cities looking for youngsters who had run away from home, that kind of thing. They would take these youngsters in their care and sexually abuse them.
<br>
<br>
You say you are only 13 years of age. So please be careful and keep your age to yourself while online. Many of these abusers can be very open and friendly and even hold down responsible public positions, may even be public faces, someone who presents himself as an authority on whatever it is. But the moment they start to lure you into somewhere more "private" then watch out.
<br>
<br>
When I say private I mean in terms of a physical location, or maybe even a private section of a website. If it is to do with some kind of mystic or guru or sect... it could be a cover for child abuse.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
in your personal experience then...there were actual mystics/gurus involved in manipulating your mind/perspective and planting some kind of "attack" seed that ensued for 5 years? was it a cult or an individual, or just something you heard passed about? what was it that finally woke you up to this? and how drastically did things change afterward? when you became aware?
<br>
<br>
lots of questions

Darkhorse:
<br>
<br>
No problem, just trying to advise you. Please keep your age to yourself as it can be a bit of a weird old world. Especially where these sects and gurus are concerned. There is a famous one in India called Sai Baba and he has been implicated in child abuse and things. The British Foreign Office were warning about him several years ago. So please be wary of announcing your age. Stay safe online my friend. Like I say, it's a weird old world.
<br>
<br>
Even people you would think totally legitimate could be implicated in all manner of sordid practices. This Sai Baba bloke sounds a right weirdo and I would be very wary, personally, of anyone who was a fan of his or who claimed some kind of friendship or association. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg. There are sects in the USA that have fed their members poison, and there have been mass deaths. It's just incredible what these weirdos and their followers get up to.
<br>

Yours,
<br>

you youngsters will be professional astral projectors by the time your my age,25, if you keep it up.  Man, to be that young again.....well, actually that would suck ( I like the bars and girls too much).  J/K.  Keep it up, there is NOTHING to be scared of in the "Astral".

<br>
Yeah, I think about that. Wow, if I could have had a facility like the Internet and forums such as the Astral Pulse at age 13! That would be incredible. To be just 13 in this day and age, that must really be something. Growing up with computers, I can easily remember the days when there were no calculators, never mind computers, lol.

Nah, Frank, having Internet access while being a kid is overrated. I don't mean to suggest that everyone's experience is the same as mine, but when I was 13 and had access to the Internet (about 9 years ago), all that happened was that I became supremely addicted to chat rooms and ICQ.
<br>
<br>
Being able to
<i>
 instantly
</i>
form personal relationships with people independent of any bias, prejudice, and tangible social contact was very alluring. There's no doubt that connecting with people in this way added to the sheer magnitude of time I spent on the computer and, although wondrous, was ultimately unhealthy.
<br>
<br>
If you are of particularly youthful boldness (like I was) and do not treat use of the Internet properly, these relationships end up being ephemeral and unsatisfying, since there is no sensory component. Like a cheap drug that loses its effect, you may try to find more like-minded strangers, and even begin using different names and pseudonyms, experimenting with different personalities and behaviors. You can imagine where that might lead.
<br>
<br>
This is part of my motivation in being such a strong advocate for contributing to the actual sensory experience of other astral projectionists. Without demonstrations of interactions in a common sensorium, this is all talk.
<i>
 [Edit: And under the circumstances that can be dangerous - as we've said about negs and religious constructs, etc.]
</i>
<br>
<br>
But I'm just saying, Frank, in the hopes to make you feel not so jealous, that from your perspective being young and having a computer might look very amazing and luxurious, and indeed it is, the added benefit may be illusory.

It is true the Internet is a major plus for anyone whom does not abuse it.
<br>
<br>
I got my first computer at age 15 and as any other teenager did abuse it.
<br>
My grades felt that the most.
<br>
<br>
About a year later I got the Internet connection, and my grades were the one that have felt the strongest consequence of that.
<br>
Of course all I did back then was chat.
<br>
<br>
<br>
But I can say that now I am extremely thankful that I have Internet connection, because now I use it most for my education (usually not related to school - like this forum, books that  I can't get in the town etc.).

You hit on it with the availability of information thing. Younger people simply don't realise what it was like before, and long may they not have to. But I have lived right through the start of the digital age and now the sheer benefits I can get just mouse-clicks away, when it would have been a heck of a treck around the houses before. Of course, I am not taking account of any downers such as the addictive nature of Chat-rooms, computer games and the like, because these elements of the overall equation have never been part of my experience. Perhaps I would see it differently in that event.
