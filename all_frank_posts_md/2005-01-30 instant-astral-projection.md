Why do you want to get to the astral plane so much? Is it because of something you expect to find there or because of something you expect to leave behind here?

Hi Toast,
<br>
Motivation is very important.  Knowing exactly why you want or need to experience astral projection is vital to succeeding at it.  Doing it because it sounds cool, is not suitable, and nothing will work for you.  If you desire to Know Yourself, your capabilities, Remember your History and what you really are, then you will most probably succeed at it if the timing is Perfect for you.
<br>
<br>
You could try the White Light method as described in my home pages at Geocities, you'll find a link near my signature.. so click it and then click spiritual when you get to Simple Spirit, then click the White Light Method's MORE button.
<br>
<br>
If you do try it, do it every day, even twice or three times a day.. the more you try it the easier it will become for you.
<br>
<br>
Good Luck
<br>

<br>
Tayesin, do you think all motivation for AP is centered around knowledge of self?
<br>
<br>
Forgive me if that question sounds narrow. It's just that whenever I am motivated to project for something other than knowledge of self (like knowledge of the future or knowledge of others) it's extremely difficult. Since mystics are generally monistic, believing the universe is all made of the same essential Self, are they motivated
<i>
 through
</i>
knowledge of self to have knowledge of the future, knowledge of others, and so on?
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance. I very much respect your wisdom in these matters.

I only agree with the first sentence. It doesn't matter what kind of motivation someone has as long as he/she

 is
</i>
motivated. I'm not interested in any of what you mentioned, but I'll still succeed if I'm determined enough.
<br>
<br>
I doubt that I'm a special case.

Telos,
<br>
I think Self-Awareness (as in knowing/being the Higher-Soul you are) is the most effective motivation because it opens everything else up for you.  The more you experience of yourself (and there is a lot of you) the more easily you will direct yourself to places like the Akasha etc, to get info on other things.
<br>
<br>
If you already know through experience that you are a hugely powerful Soul in your own right, there is nothing out there (or inside) that is not able to be penetrated (perceived) by You.
<br>
<br>
Service to others is already being done by you simply from reconnecting with this huge self you are and Being that here in the world.
<br>
<br>
Veccolo,
<br>
That's okay to disagree too.
<br>
<br>
Yes you will succeed.  And it is okay to have whatever motivation you choose. All I am saying is Gnosis is the most effective motivation.

I did not mean to turn this into a thread about motivation. My point was just that it is common to want to go out of body to get away from something in the physical. That kind of motivation just results in being more solidly trapped in the physical. It is also really hard to have a very specific motivation to get out of body because of something about the astral plane before having very specific experience from being there. To try to get back on to the subject's original thread, does anyone have any ideas on directly converting strong motivation to explore the astral into a technique for going there?

Tom,
<br>
Time out from the 3D is important, well at least I think so anyway.  It allows us to get clearer perspectives on things we have experienced and other situations in our lives.  I use sitting in the white light for ten or so minutes a day, which is plenty of time to re-energize, re-evaluate, and re-adjust before stepping back into the day to day living.
<br>
<br>
I agree that it is hard to find motivation, by using something from astral experience, if there is not a lot of experience yet.   Perhaps desiring to know your purposes here, or who you are as a spirit might be enough motivation to start with.
<br>
<br>
Converting that motivation into projection isn't the hard bit.  The Intent we have is of key importance, so that is driven by the Motivation.  The hard bit is the getting out of body while you are awake and aware.  Try a method daily and see if it will work for you, if not, choose another one and try that one every day too..  for a while.  Try the White Light method at my home pages, it's fairly basic to use and some people who stick to it have reported good results so far.

Telos:
<br>
<br>
There is ultimately only knowledge of Self. We talk about concepts such as "others" or "future" as if they separate from us in some way. But we place these barriers, or create these distinctions, for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I think it's safe to say that most people want to project because it sounds AMAZING. I think it's getting pretty deep (psychologically) to assume that somebody wants to learn the art of projection because of some problem in the waking life. Again, I think it's safe to say that most people just think it sounds fun! Of course there are some people who get into it with a more spiritual approach (myself included), but I believe it is just as good to be interested for the simple reason that it is FUN.
