hello to the people

<br>
<br>
i have had 2 identicle screams like someone is being tortured  coming from within my head,  first i was watching tv and assumed it was that.  But it happened just now in the bathroom and everything was silent,  the Exact same scream from earlier,   it sounds bizzare,  but im assuming its because of the NEW work im  doing and the fact that my psychic self is being "born"
<br>
could maybe it be an evil spirit stalking me, knowing that i  will be a prone target sooner or later because of my projection attemps?

I have always had a very strange ability to hear certain things that others don't. I don't exactly hear them though, they are more of hearing a though inside my head. Before while meditating I have suddenly heard a loud scream out of nowhere. I also have the ability to unfocus my thoughts and let voices of many people i know closely to begin to speak. it sounds insane i know, but I have used it to turn people away who try to do me harm. Im only 14, so i still have to deal with crap from people at school. I can figure out what a person is going to say before they say it, and when i speak as they do, it terrifys them. I think you have an odd perceptive skill like me and/or have strong indentations of other peoples personalities on your mind. Its fun to learn to use and quite amusing too.

It's not odd.  I consider it normal.
<br>
<br>
I often hear many different voices when drifting off to sleep.  My mind sorta opens up.  They do not seem to come from any one direction but rather from all over.  I have not heard anyone scream as if in pain, but I do get people yelling some times.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest maybe either trying to block that one sound or if you feel up to trying to assertain who and or what is screaming.
<br>
<br>
But I urge you very strongly to trust your own instincts.  If you feel that it might be bad then do not do anything more.  Push it away, block it.  HOwever realize this as well.  Do not be afraid of it even if it is bad.  It does not matter to much that you are new to this.  If you have the ability to hear it then you have the ability to block it or protect yourself from it.   Trust in yourself.
<br>
<br>
I tend to be a little more openly curious.  I would try to find out why first.
<br>
<br>
A few notes on things you may hear.
<br>
<br>
1)  Often random noises are not to be worried about.  Yes they can be anoying but as hearing for the astral improves so does your physical hearing.  That means that you will hear a lot more noises generated by your enviroment.
<br>
2)  Voices can be a lot of fun at times.  Listen to them.  YOu may find some to be of people you know and others to be strangers.  Or even just random thoughts of people.  Some times they are conversations and such.
<br>
3)  Some times open communication is possible.  However you shold only commmunicate and not "invite" any thing in.  There are 2 reasons for this, one it could be a bad thing, and two, it "could" cause some what of a flood gate effect.  That being the same as to kicking out the dam holding back all the water.  The possible onslaught of information could prove a little over whelming.
<br>
4)  The voice pitches should never change!  This is important.  Just as if you were talking to some one normally thier voice does not change.  Should you encounter a voice that does change pitch while speaking you need to turn it off.  Do anything to stop hearing it and push it out.  It has been my experience that a change in voice pitch is an attempt for some thing to mask what it is.  And also in my experience they have always been bad.  If need be get up and do something different, like a physical task, some thing to take your mind away from your hearing.

The one HUMUNGOUS stumbling block for anyone seeking spiritual enlightenment is presented by the fact that the sense of conscious awareness you take with you, to the Astral, is the exact same one as you have with you on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
In fact, once on the Astral proper, tread the correct path and you will become aware that your collective sense of conscious awareness IS you; which is merely "plugged into" your physical body. Knowledge of which is quite exciting, at first. But the novelty eventually wears off, as you become more and more accustomed to the idea: to the point where you just accept it.
<br>
<br>
Another aspect of spiritual enlightenment which you must learn to just accept: is the fact that, at first, the protective aspect of your sense of conscious awareness will behave like a fish out of water.
<br>
<br>
I would say that what you heard is just Stray Energy. It
<u>
 very
</u>
<u>
 often
</u>
comes about just prior to making contact with the Astral. For me it's a signpost that tells me I'm almost there. Yet there are those who would readily agree that you could well be being stalked by an "evil spirit" preparing to entrap you the moment your set foot on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Well, if the spirit was so evil then why warn you of its presence. Surely, the "evil" thing to do would be to remain entirely hidden until your most vulnerable moment. But, then again, I don't know what an evil spirit is exactly. I assume people mean those "entities" I spent around 5-years "fighting" in a place I later termed the Training Ground.
<br>
<br>
<u>
 What I do know, for an absolute fact, is that Stray Energy can be perceived in many strange kinds of ways
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
When I was starting out, I would regularly hear all kinds of pops, bangs, yells, screams, rips, tears, hooting sounds, growling noises, etc. At first, on hearing such noises, what naturally happens is, the protective aspect of your awareness makes an
<u>
 instant
</u>
<u>
 judgement
</u>
as to what the sound might be...
<i>
 exactly as it would do on the physical
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Therein lies the problem:
<br>
<br>
On the Astral, different rules apply. As such, one of the MAJOR initial challenges is to teach the protective aspect of your awareness that there is one set of rules for the Physical, and a different set of rules for the Astral.
<br>

<br>
Yes, you have to please get used to the idea of listening to all kinds of sounds in your head. Monroe, for example, had worked to the point where he could "sense" his connection to the Astral all the time. With me, often I'll be relaxing, pottering around in my workshop, listening to all kinds of stuff going on within.
<br>
<br>
The big problem, still, is it's not something you generally want to be talking to people about. Hearing "voices" in your head I mean.
<br>

I've had some similar experiences too, but I'm not sure if it was enhanced astral hearing that you guys were explaining.
<br>
<br>
I sort of have an enhanced environmental hearing that if I'm concentrating I can hear things that most other people can't.
<br>
<br>
<br>
how do you get or learn that hearing skill?

<section>
wow it's so nice to read Frank again, thank you Leon!
<br>
<br>
How to get there?  It's a side effect, or by-product, of energy work.  Meditate, my friend!
