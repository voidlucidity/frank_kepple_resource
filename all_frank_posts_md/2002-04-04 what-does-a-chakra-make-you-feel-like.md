<section>
<br>
A couple of days ago, on another post, I said I wouldn't know a Chakra from a hole in the ground. But this morning I had an experience that I didn't recognise. I wondered if someone had an idea of what happened.
<br>
<br>
I have been slowing down the projection process as much as possible in order to make it as controllable (and as describable) as I can possibly make it. So this morning I was practicing slowly relaxing and feeling my legs getting heavier and monitoring that feeling rising upwards through my body. Only instead of just letting it happen, as I would normally do, I'd purposely induce a stray thought or two. This had the effect of momentarily halting the deadening process. Then I'd let it rise a little more then halt it, then let it rise a little more, etc.
<br>
<br>
Right, so at one point something very unfamiliar happened. I began to feel a continuous tingle through my whole body. Then, over a period of the next few seconds, it seemed my body became about 3 times its normal size. Then I had this feeling like my whole body was made of spongy foam. It felt like the stuff they use for foam mattresses and cushions, etc. And something weird happened to my breathing. I understand about breathing through the diaphragm and normally I can feel this muscle moving up and down in a cyclic motion. But it was like with each breath I could actually feel my lungs themselves. Each time I breathed in it was like the air was an electric current that I could actually feel flowing in and out of my body.
<br>
<br>
It was a very pleasant feeling so I ran with it for a while. Then it suddenly occured to me that, although the energy was spreading throughout my whole body (all 3x the size of it!) this energy actually seemed to be flowing in and out of my body from just one area of my chest. It was almost like a hole had opened up and this energy was flowing in and out of it. I concentrated on the exact area and quickly shut this thing down by willing myself to move... then immediately put my hand on my chest right where I had estimated this "hole" to be, before I forgot. It was then that I realised my hand was placed exactly where my physical heart is.
<br>
<br>
Can anyone give me a clue here?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That sounds like your heart chakra being 'woken up.' Just like if you eat spicy food, it will tingle and wake your mouth up, certain energetic activities wake your chakras up. Chakra is a sanskrit word meaning 'spinning wheel.' You can call them energy centers if that makes it easier. You can call them Hoopamajoobs, it really doesn't matter.
<br>
<br>
There's a WEALTH of information about chakras and the energy body on the 'Net, and I would suggest starting with Robert's N.E.W. system available to read on this website. Using N.E.W. could have a positive effect on your projections the same way eating right and living a healthy lifestyle could.

   When my heart chakra activates it feels just like my physical heart beating very fast and hard, sometimes I've been worried and put my hand on my chest to check that I am not having a heart attack as I suspect, and find the physical calm and normal.  As you are used to conscious projection you probably dont have such strong sensations.
   <br>
   <br>
   The other day, during an OBE attempt, I felt my brow chakra activate, which felt like air bubbles moving rapidly around under the skin in my forehead.  I dont know much about chakras myself but I assume it was my brow chakra.  Unfortunately all these 'sensations' have not led to anything '

Thanks for the info bitsmart but I cannot make head nor tail of it. I was flipping through and it all sounded mighty confusing, however, I found a brilliant little nugget of text that describes a part of what I felt absolutely perfectly:
<br>
<br>
"............ as the Sub-Navel centre is being filled it automatically overflows into the Sub-Heart storage centre; and as the Sub-Heart storage centre is being filled it automatically overflows into the Sub-Brow storage centre. So when energy is directed solely into the Sub-Navel centre, the two higher centres above it are automatically filled at the same time......"
<br>
<br>
Okay, it doesn't go into describing the feeling so much as the channeling of the energy. Reading that papragraph reminded me of something I forgot... just before the tingling feeling there was a feeling that some kind of "connection" had been made from my abdomen to my chest. Then it felt like the energy was being channeled upwards to my head. At which point I decided to stop to make some quick notes.
<br>

Hi!
<br>
The sensations you felt sound a lot like those you might get in a trance - do you know what your etheric body is? It is basically your energy body, chakras and all. When you go to sleep this expands and fills itself with energy (I think this is when most people get a lot of their energy...). When you go into a trance your mind shifts into the etheric body, which you percieve as your body, and the etheric body can expand in this state (depending on the depth of trance). Myself, when my third eye chakra was coming out of dormancy (age 15-16 maybe) I felt an overwhelming mental and physical "pressure" of being massively large and at time same time intesely small, with visual black/white contrasts (seeing strange patterns, black/white ones that is). Freaked me out it was so powerful. I think that as primary chakras start to awaken you can get some pretty odd sensations associated with them.
<br>
How familiar are you with trance? I also get a feeling of gentle expansion sometimes, a lot of trance sensations are odd but interesting.

G,day Frank
<br>
<br>
When I first got into Chakra's &amp; learning of their uses I had a
<br>
bit of trouble digesting it or accepting their validity.After
<br>
reading up on them for a couple of years &amp; experimenting I
<br>
discovered a science site,so being the skeptic I am, the science
<br>
explanation of the Chakra,s launched me into another world all
<br>
together,as I could see a physical reality to this idea of Chakra,s.
<br>
For some reason most sites dont go into depth about the "Real" &amp;
<br>
physical aspects of the Chakra system &amp; how it is related to
<br>
the endocrine system &amp; the messages the brain transmits through
<br>
the chemical secretions of "Cyclins" &amp; "Kinases" to all of these
<br>
Chakra,s.
<br>
<br>
When I swapped all the Chakra names for the names of particular
<br>
glands &amp; muscles,it really took off for me.
<br>
<br>
1)Root/base of spine/almost as important as the other end of the spine/Black Onyx or Obsidian used in conjunction with/corresponding
<br>
mucical note C.
<br>
<br>
2)Sacral/genitals/Carnelian crystal/musical note D.
<br>
<br>
3)Solar Plexus/Citrine/E
<br>
<br>
4)Heart/Rose quartz,ruby/F
<br>
<br>
5)Throat/Indigo/G
<br>
<br>
6)Brow/Amethyst,clear quartz,aquamarine/A
<br>
<br>
7)Crown/Amethyst,clear quartz/B
<br>
<br>
After putting together all the major glands in the body,it can be
<br>
easily seen that all of them coincide with a major or minor Chakra.
<br>
The Spleen,Adrenal glands,pancreas,lymph glands,thyroid gland,pineal gland &amp; the pirtuitary gland.
<br>
<br>
I find now that I can activate any one of these glands while
<br>
focusing on them for a short while.The pineal &amp; pirtuitary are my
<br>
favourites for obvious reasons,they are the brow &amp; crown Chakra,s &amp;
<br>
good old cerebral cortex.The easiest I find is the Adrenal gland,but
<br>
too much just gives me butterflies.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I don't see any difference between my control of my Astral
<br>
body &amp; my physical body.If you can get to the point where you
<br>
realize you can project your body &amp; that there is more to you,there
<br>
should be little restrictions in controlling your physical body,just
<br>
will power.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys

I found you post very interesting. Could you please tell us a little more about some of the various glands you mentioned - what effect does activating them have? Is it the same as activating a particlular chakra, and if not what method do you use?

<br>
Thank you for your post, Mobius, that's what I am now beginning to realise, i.e. these "Chakras" can be activated by just concentrating on them. My problem was, I couldn't grasp a sense of what I should actually be concentrating upon in the first place. You said in your post the Adrenal is the easiest. Now, if someone says to me to concentrate on some weird and wonderful concept of some Chakra or other then, personally, I'm hopelessly lost... but ask me to concentrate on my Adrenal glands and I instantly comprehend what is required. Hey Presto! I get a major feeling of butterflies.
<br>
<br>
Thanks mate.

G,day everyone
<br>
<br>
Inguma,I believe the descriptions of what Chakra,s do is somewhat
<br>
similar to what the particular glands in the body
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///do.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 do.You
</a>
allready
<br>
know what the Adrenal gland does &amp; your Gonads but the rest I
<br>
will let you read yourself &amp; anyone else who is interested a
<br>
description of each one.
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.umm.edu/endocrin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.umm.edu/endocrin/
</a>
<br>
<br>
The Pineal gland or the Third eye/brow Chakra is the one I focus on
<br>
for my Astral activities using the technique Frank mentioned of
<br>
rolling your eyes up,but I focus on the Pineal gland &amp; when it starts
<br>
throbbing I know I,m in for some fun!
<br>
Here's some more info on the old Third eye/Pineal gland/Brow chakra
<br>
<br>

 http://www.crystalinks.com/thirdeyepineal.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
Frank it sits a bit better with me too being able to focus on a
<br>
particular gland &amp; feed some energy into bugger!When told about
<br>
Chakra,s a few years back I thought "What the hell are they on about?"
<br>
I cant see these things &amp; it doesn,t mention anything in my Biology
<br>
books.When I eventually put the two systems together I realized
<br>
it was the Eastern worlds metaphorical picture of little energy
<br>
systems in your body.The Chinese system of Yin &amp; Yang &amp; accupuncture
<br>
made sense in this way of thinking as well.
<br>
<br>
I think everyone should be able to activate their Adrenal gland
<br>
after a bit of practice &amp; if they are capable of OBE,it should make
<br>
it much quicker to learn.Most people can remember a time in their
<br>
life when they had a "fight or flight" situation &amp; the Adrenal gland
<br>
kicked in giving you intstant energy,as well as increased strength &amp;
<br>
dexterity,some people have lifted cars while Adrenalin has pumped
<br>
through their
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///veins.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 veins.So
</a>
it's just a matter of thinking back to what
<br>
that feeling was like &amp; focus on it.

Mobius, good to hear someone else mentioning the relationship between the chakras and the notes on a musical scale. They correspond not just to the western scale, but the Saraswati (Indian), and maybe others as well, in ascending order. They also correspond with the first seven harmonics.
<br>
<br>
Healings Sounds, a book by Jonathan Goldman (www.healingsounds.com) tells ALL about the relationship between sound/vibration, energy, healing, harmonics, etc.
<br>
<br>
Amazing stuff!

Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
Kifyre I have lost the site where I got some of my stuff on Chakra,s
<br>
&amp; when I went through your link,it seemed very similar to the
<br>
sites I had seen,unfortunately I printed them all out &amp; cropped the
<br>

<br>
throw away
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///references.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
thanks for adding that site,we now have a
<br>
good little comprehensive guide for Chakra's with all these links.
<br>
<br>
Hi bitsmart,I was hoping someone would notice that (about the notes).
<br>
I really do believe there is a relationship between the notes &amp;
<br>
different Chakra's,the ancients "knew", I have read quite a few times
<br>
about ancients using musical notes &amp; chanting to perform all sorts
<br>
of tasks,my main interest with that respect is there is hard
<br>
evidence that some monks used instruments &amp; chants to levitate
<br>
anything up to 20 to 30 tonne! &amp; they did it 400ft up a cliff!
<br>
I should probably continue this in the "Power of music" topic in
<br>
Metaphysical Forum? good to see someone else has been down this road.

Hi ya Mobius &amp; Everyone else!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the info &amp; links related to the connection between chakras, glands, and music---my intent is to understand these connections more as I go (i.e., grow). Anyone else's interest to share anything related to all this is most appreciated.
<br>
<br>
My experience to date is limited, but I can share a coupla things for y'all...I've played the guitar for 25+ years. I remember as kids growing up in Honolulu, my best friend and I just decided one day to become musicians. Soon after, we were quite caught up in sounds, all sounds. Sounds we could make, sounds we could hear, etc...
<br>
<br>
Across the street from my house was our elementary school, which had a small electric generator encased in a metal box large enough for the two of us to climb up on it, with or without our guitars. One day we tried to vocalize the droning hum that was coming from the machine inside, that is, duplicate it in pitch (i.e., "on key" I guess you could say) and in tone (the sonic characteristics of the sound). We chanted along with this generator for 20-30 seconds when we both became acutely aware that our perception of our reality had been enhanced or changed.
<br>
<br>
The fact that we couldn't sing along exactly in key with each other &amp; the machine created an independent pulsing frequency that seemed quite hypnotic to the two of us, so much so that we kept experimenting with it to find the chanting pitch that induced the greatest perception alteration. We found we could vary the speed of this pulse by how "in tune" or not we were to the machine's drone.
<br>
<br>
I've since learned that this "3rd" created frequency phenomenon is called a "frequency-following response", and is a basis for the Monroe Institute's research into Hemi-Sync meditation (go figure, eh?!). Also---from the Buddhist monk chants and Hindu mystical ragas I've been enamored with over the years, I think that there most certainly is a connection between meditative states and the singing/playing/sounding of certain notes in relation to the over-riding "Tonic" note (or key) that is performed for an extened period of time...
<br>
<br>
Another tidbit: while performing my resonant tuning exercise of singing/humming along with a pre-recorded drone of a (mostly) human choir of voices who are basically staying around one pitch/note, I found that if I purposefully sing just a tiny bit sharp (above) or flat (below) the choir, I can physically (etherically?) feel the stimulation of my major chakras, especially those in proximity to my lungs and vocal cords...physically, the vibration caused by the pitch differential in turn stimulates the related glands, especially the heart...
<br>
<br>
This is most interesting stuff for me, and I continue to explore (given my love of sound); any comments welcome.
<br>
<br>
Greg

G,day Greg!
<br>
<br>
Good to hear from you again &amp; great to see you are a fellow guitar
<br>
player.I wish we could tie this topic &amp; "the power of music" topic
<br>
in one of the other forums,but we are on something slightly
<br>
different here.
<br>
<br>
I can't read music notations (well I can but not the best)but I can
<br>
read tablature &amp; have a wide range of music
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///books.one" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 books.One
</a>
thing that
<br>
gives me an advantage though &amp; I suspect you have this also after
<br>
your post greg is "Perfect Pitch",that is being able to hear a sound/
<br>
note &amp; reproduce it exactly by humming or on an instrument.
<br>
<br>
When I read your post I was beaming with excitement as I have done a
<br>
similar thing &amp; still experiment with it all the time.
<br>
It was great reading about you tuning your chakra's or putting
<br>
different frequencies through them as this is a technique that has
<br>
powerful reactions with me &amp; is such a quick way for me to do
<br>
energy workings &amp; OBE,s.What I do is use my body like a tuning fork,
<br>
by hitting a note that coincides with a chakra or some music that is
<br>
in the key of that chakra &amp; I make that particular chakra vibrate at
<br>
the same level as the note or key.Once you hear the note you can
<br>
hum it or chant it transfering the vibrations out of your skull.
<br>
Change the pitch up or down slightly,a higher or lower octave,ther is
<br>
so many variations.
<br>
<br>
I havn,t got any books that exclusively talk about the relationship
<br>
of music or sound,the body &amp; objects in general,does anyone in here
<br>
know of one,I,m very keen to develop this further.
<br>
<br>
Good luck on your journeys

I almost bought it at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Amazon.com
</a>
, got caught up reading all the reviews and related books, then got sidetracked (if I'm online, it means I'm at my job, so I should do some work for them...ha!)

Tuning Forks indeed! Keep experimenting dude, no substitute for the real thing...there is definitely something going on with this.

Love &amp; light to all,

Hi everyone!
<br>
<br>
Yes that site that bitsmart posted had got me intrigued as well,I
<br>
havn't got around to tracking that book down,but looks right up my
<br>
alley as well.
<br>
<br>
Bitsmart have you actually got that book or have read it? I also
<br>
noted the guy has workshops for his music &amp; chants,sounds very
<br>
interesting!I havn't had the time to read any personal books for
<br>
a few weeks as my studies have me up to my neck in text books,so I
<br>
have a lot of books sitting here in the waiting queue to be read &amp;
<br>
a list of books a page long,that I,m yet to borrow or buy,so this
<br>
book that bitsmart mentioned I wont get to until later in the year,
<br>
damn!
<br>
<br>

Interesting replies to this!
<br>
<br>
I cannot add much, except that I also feel that cushiony "foam mattress" feeling. I was wondering what the heck that was! Sometimes it feels great, and sometimes it freaks me out. I was having that feeling the other day, in fact. It almost feels like I'm inside my brain/skull. Really wierd, almost like I'm phazing myself...does that make sense?
<br>
<br>
I've discovered some of that musical stuff myself. I have a theory I have been developing myself on this; I do not have it worked out yet, but when I do, I'll be sure to share it with you.
<br>
<br>
Very fascinating...
<br>
<br>
I'm going to go meditate now, so if anything interesting happens, I'll be sure to let you know.
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>

I never had a notion of chakras when I was a kid.  I had a very cold bedroom(no carpet), and the bed was next to the window. I found I could make myself very warm by concentrating on my stomach area. Somewhere around the solar plexus area would start generating lots of heat. It also felt flat, like a round disk was under the skin about 5 inches in diameter. The heat would travel to my feet and hands too.
<br>
<br>
I used to get really bad headaches, mom would give me aspirin, but they never worked, so I refused to take them anymore. I learned to lift the pain from inside my head, to just above it, say about a couple of inches or so. The pain spot was still there, but I moved it outside my head where I couldn't feel it. Sometimes when doing this, I get flashing lights and clicking or popping noises from inside my head.
<br>
<br>
I too play guitar, for meditation, kind of a fusion of jazz and blues.
<br>
I have effects pedals that produce all kinds of phasing, modulation, and delays. It can really put you in a trance like state when everything sounds good and those certain chordings just come out of nowhere. Your playing for two hours straight and its like your listening to someone else play, and then you snap out of it and say,"Whoa, how did I do that?". And then you can't go back and repeat it because you were playing subconsciously, and weren't paying attention to what was happening on the fretboard.
<br>
I have a keyboard and hooked it up to the effects and amps, I'm in the process of finding certain notes mixed with modulation and phasing along with stereo. Hopefully I'm going to find a certain sound that I can record and use as a tool to wake up and energize the chakras and produce a trance state.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long post....

G,day Nightlier!
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean when you say the time just goes by &amp; just when
<br>
you phase out of the physical for a moment you come up with riffs,
<br>
chords or tunes you never expected.
<br>
It's strange when I,m learning a song by an existing artist,it's
<br>
just me &amp; the sheet music,but when I'm making up my own songs I use
<br>
something I,ve only told my writing partner about &amp; thats what I
<br>
call "pluckin it from the ether"(just my own term for helping me
<br>
understand where they come from) a simple analogy is the "Force" in
<br>
"Star Wars" where instead of trusting what you think you see or
<br>
know,instead trust in the unseen forces &amp; just let it happen.
<br>
<br>
I feel that when I,m just letting it happen,I get input from the
<br>
ether,we are one &amp; music just comes onto the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///guitar.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 guitar.So
</a>
I understand
<br>
where you are coming from &amp; often say "did I do that?".
<br>
<br>
I have an effects board,a BOSS ME-6,a bit of an old girl these days
<br>
but still has Compression,over-d/distortion,e-q,noise suppressor,delay
<br>
,chorus/flanger &amp;
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///reverb.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 reverb.You
</a>
can really lose yourself for a while
<br>
playing with effects.I hope to get a BOSS G-T 6 soon which has more
<br>
than double the capabilities,then I'll really lose time!
<br>
<br>
When I've been playing for a couple of hours my entire body seems to
<br>
vibrate in whichever key I'm playing in,as opposed to when I first
<br>
start &amp; there is a localised vibration around the solar plexus &amp;
<br>
heart.
<br>
<br>
O.k I'll stop now or I'll start to gush,good stuff here.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys

Yes Mobius, it's amazing how it feels when it's just you and the guitar. And that momment happens and you feel it coming out!
<br>
My whole body gets buzzing, and my legs are wobbley afterwards, but that maybe due to the volume. NAH!!
