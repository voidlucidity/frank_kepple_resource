<section>
Hello,
<br>
<br>
Did anybody hear about Shane Hatfield and his book "The Amazing Out-of-Body Secret!"? The link is
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astral-projections.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astral-projections.com/
</a>
. The web site promises havens, but it also looks like a scam from a guy who just wants to collect $20+ from gullible souls...
<br>
<br>
A search did not show any info about the guy.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
DG.

Never heard of him. Maybe he's legit- probably took a couple of techniques and made a book around it. Probably would make Astral Dynamics look like it is worth $100 though. Why don't you order one and report?

Yea, I was thinking about it. Just want to ask people first, may be somebody already tried it. After all, $20 is not a big deal, "in the name of science".

There's a money back guarantee...
<br>
He seems to think it's very simple and everybody should be able to do it easily.
<br>
I guess there's nothing to lose because of the satisfaction guarantee, unless there's some hidden catch in there.

Just remember that almost all, if not all, ads that promise something quickly are usually scams or not a very good way of going about doing something. Just look at all the diet ads that promise losing 10 lbs in one week. It may be possible but it is not healthy Â to loose more than a pound or two a week. With all the people that are and have been exploring astral projection no one has ever came up with a way to do it instantly as Shane promises. It requires practice to be able to project. I do believe that it is possible to project instantly, but I cannot see someone, especially a skeptic, being able to project on their first try. Now that I have been nice and cynical, let me say that I would like to know what this thing is that he has claimed to discover. Maybe he has discovered something that everyone else has over looked. Maybe he is legit. If anyone is interested then go for it and report back to us.

Folks, I wouldn't bother. I just downloaded it out of interest in order to report to you all what it's about.
<br>
<br>
The description, "but it also looks like a scam from a guy who just wants to collect $20+ from gullible souls..." suggested by the original poster is absolutely spot on.
<br>
<br>

Yours,
