Hi:
<br>
<br>
If you go to RB's website you will see he has his own forum now. There was something of a parting of the ways between our administrator here and Robert Bruce, the precise details of which have remained private between the respective parties. This resulted in Robert Bruce setting up his own forum. Essentially, it all boils down to the fact that times change, people change and events move on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
