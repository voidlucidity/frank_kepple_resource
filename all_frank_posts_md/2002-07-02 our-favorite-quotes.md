<section>
I WILL PERSIST
<br>
<br>
I will persist until I succeed. I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins.
<br>
I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd, I am a lion and I refuse to walk, to talk, to sleep with the sheep.
<br>
I will hear not those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious. Let them join the sheep.
<br>
The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny.
<br>
I will persist until I succeed.
<br>
The prizes of life are at the end of each journey not near the beginning, and it is not given unto me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal.
<br>
Failure I may still encounter at the thousandth step, yet success hides behind the next bend in the road.
<br>
Never will I know how close it lies unless I take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another and yet another.
<br>
In truth one step at a time is not that difficult.
<br>
-Og Mandino
<br>
<br>
<br>
To thou who thinkest to seek Me, know that thy seeking and
<br>
yearning shall avail thee not unless thou knowest the Mystery.
<br>
If that which thou seekest thou findest not within thee,
<br>
thou wilt never find it without.
<br>
<br>

  It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses; to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which you would be strongly tempted to worship... or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree, helping each other to one or the other of these destinations.

  There are no ordinary people. You have never walked with or talked to a mere mortal...

I've put this one under fave quote in my personal details, but ever since I heard it I can't get it out of my head. I'ts kind of become my theme in life:
<br>
<br>
For that one fraction of a second you were open to options you had never considered.
<br>
That is the exploration that awaits you. Not mapping stars or studying nebulae, but charting the unlimited possibilities of existence.

I love William Blake, so here it is!:
<br>
Quotations of William Blake
<br>
(1757-1827)
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from Annotations to Lavater, 1788 (age 31)
<br>
Damn sneerers!
<br>
True superstition is ignorant honesty &amp; this is beloved of god and man.
<br>
Forgiveness of enemies can only come upon their repentance.
<br>
Active Evil is better than Passive Good.
<br>
They suppose that Woman's Love is Sin; in consequence all the Loves &amp; Graces with them are Sin.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from Annotations to Swedenborg, 1788
<br>
There can be no Good Will. Will is always Evil; it is persecution to others or selfishness.
<br>
If a thing loves, it is infinite.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from There Is No Natural Religion, 1788
<br>
Reason, or the ratio of all we have already known, is not the same that it shall be when we know more.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from All Religions are One, 1788
<br>
The true method of knowledge is experiment.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, 1790-93
<br>
Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained.
<br>
How do you know but ev'ry Bird that cuts the airy way, / Is an immense world of delight, clos'd by your senses five?
<br>
Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.
<br>
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
<br>
He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.
<br>
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.
<br>
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
<br>
What is now proved was once only imagin'd.
<br>
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.
<br>
Every thing possible to be believ'd is an image of truth.
<br>
The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow.
<br>
The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.
<br>
He who has suffer'd you to impose on him, knows you.
<br>
The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
<br>
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
<br>
If others had not been foolish, we should be so.
<br>
As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.
<br>
Damn braces: Bless relaxes.
<br>
Exuberance is Beauty.
<br>
Improvement makes strait roads; but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of Genius.
<br>
Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.
<br>
Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd.
<br>
The voice of honest indignation is the voice of God.
<br>
Man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.
<br>
Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from the Notebook, 1793
<br>
The Question Answer'd
<br>
What is it men in women do require? The lineaments of Gratified Desire. / What is it women do in men require? The lineaments of Gratified Desire.
<br>
Lacedemonian Instruction
<br>
'Come hither, my boy, tell me what thou seest there?' / 'A fool tangled in a religious snare.'
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from Songs of Experience, 1789-94
<br>
Children of the future Age / Reading this indignant page, / Know that in a former time / Love! sweet Love! was thought a crime.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from Annotations to Watson, 1798
<br>
The Man who pretends to be a modest enquirer into the truth of a self evident thing is a Knave.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
from the Notebook, 1800-03
<br>
When a Man has Married a Wife he finds out whether / Her Knees &amp; elbows are only glued together
<br>

From Terry Pratchett (for a comedic author a frightnengly intelligent knowledgable and insightful person) -
<br>
<br>
Seeing things that are really there is much harder than seeing things that aren't, everyone does that.

Chaos is found in abundance wherever order is being sought. It always defeats order, because it is better organised.

idle to talk of any final victory over materialism."

I think psychedelics play a major part in what we do, but having said that, I feel that if somebody's going to experiment with those things they really need to educate themselves about them. People just taking the chemicals and diving in without having any kind of preparation about what they're about to experience tend to have no frame of reference, so they're missing everything flying by and all these new perspectives. It's just a waste. They reach a little bit of spiritual enlightenment, but they end up going, 'Well, now I need that drug to get back there again.' The trick is to use the drugs once to get there, and maybe spend the next ten years trying to get back there without the drug.

enlivening, and enriching to the largest degree -
<br>
is this not a precious home for all of us earthlings?
<br>
Is it not worth our love?

Does it not deserve all the inventiveness and courage

from degradation and destruction and, by doing so,
<br>
to secure our own survival?

"So I felt this burning summer. In form I might

belong to humankind; in reality I seemed one of a

ravenous self-destroying horde of rats.
<br>
I am glad there is no God. If there were,

I cannot imagine that we rampant, myopic, and

insatiably self-centred creatures should

be allowed to survive a single day more".

"We've got to save the world
<br>
Someone's children, they may need it.
<br>
So far we've seen
<br>
The big business of extinction bleed it.
<br>
We've got to save the world.
<br>
We're at the mercy of the few,

With evil hearts determined to
<br>
Reduce this planet to hell,

Then find a buyer and make a quick sale.

We've got to save the world

Someone else may want to use it.

we gotta save, we gotta save the world".

"Putting ecological politics into actions means approaching life
<br>
with imagination and intelligence, knowledge and emotion,
<br>
responsibility and culture. It fights against bureaucracy
<br>
and ideology, uniformity, authoritarianism, and any attempt

to eliminate diversity and autonomy. And to everyone

it offers a new friend: the Earth'.

"Most people are on the world, not in it - have
<br>
no conscious sympathy or relationship to anything about them -
<br>
undiffused, separate, and rigidly alone
<br>
like marbles of polished stone, touching but separate...
<br>
How hard to realize that every camp of men or beast
<br>
has this glorious starry firmament for a roof! In such places
<br>
standing alone on the mountain-top it is easy to realize
<br>
that whatever special nests we make - leaves and moss like the marmots
<br>
and birds, or tents or piled stone - we all dwell in a house of one room -
<br>
the world with the firmament for its roof - and are sailing the
<br>
celestial spaces without leaving any track..."

"Now that green has become the fashionable prestige color,
<br>
we should be careful not to be diverted or misled by products,
<br>
projects, technologies, or institutions that may proclaim
<br>
themselves 'green' but in reality use this as a cover to continue
<br>
exploit both nature and people. Our fear is that the
<br>
rhetoric of ecology will be used by the power structures
<br>
to confuse and mislead. Policies that are designed
<br>
by corporate interests or on their behalf are being drawn up in
<br>
nice-sounding ecological terms such as 'sustainable development'
<br>
and 'forestry action plans'. Environmentalists therefore have to
<br>
continue to give deep interpretations and clear analysis of the
<br>
ecological crisis, and to have critiques of the false solutions."

one of us, in our own little comfortable ways,

respect and attention our beloved Mother deserves."

<br>
"The multiple threats to the Earth are so complex
<br>
that in most cases they seem beyond the reach of an
<br>
average citizen's influence. Yet we can all launch a
<br>
personal campaign to reduce consumption - though perhaps
<br>
only after a change of mind-set, to overcome the fear of
<br>
seeming poor, parsimonious or eccentric.
<br>
This does not mean being deprived or uncomfortable.
<br>
It simply means stopping to think, before each purchase,
<br>
'Do I really need this?' For years a small minority has been living
<br>
and thinking thus. If a large majority did lilkewise -
<br>
if frugality and shabbiness could become trendy - then the Earth,
<br>
though not saved, would be measurably less endangered."

"If we love our children, we must love our earth
<br>
with tender care and pass it on, diverse and beautiful,
<br>
so that on a warm spring day 10,000 years hence
<br>
they can feel peace in a sea of grass,
<br>
can watch a bee visit a flower,

can hear a sandpiper call in the sky,

<br>
"Our cities must be decentralized into communities, or
<br>
ecocommunnities, exquisitely and artfully tailored to
<br>
the carrying capacity of the ecosystems in which they are located.
<br>
Our technologies must be readapted and advanced into ecotechnologies,
<br>
exquisitely and artfully adapted to make use of local energy sources
<br>
and materials, with minimal or no pollution of the environment.
<br>
We must recover a new sense of our needs -
<br>
needs that foster a healthful life and express our individual
<br>
proclivities, not "needs" dictated by the mass media.
<br>
We must restore the human scale in our environment
<br>
and in our social relations..."

Some of my favourites:
<br>
<br>
From The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, "The moving finger writes and, having writ, moves on: Nor all thy peity nor Wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, nor all thy Tears wash out a word of it"
<br>
<br>
and from "Bless This Child"  - C.C. Spellman :
<br>
<br>
"Anything dirty or decayed attracts negative energy line a magnet. The person needing protection must not provide the astral attacker with anything containing his or her personal essense.  Everone has heard of Voodoo doctors using hair or nail parings when they make their dolls.  This is done because the debris of our bodies contains enough of our individual essense to make an energy link.  This link forms a sort of etheric device the attacker can use to tap into its victim's energy source.
<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to go on an occasional wild-goose chase; that is what wild geese are made for. - Henry S. Haskins
<br>
<br>
If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias in his garden, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Ghobi desert.  He will not be striving for it as a goal itself.  He will have become aware that he is happy in the course of living life twenty-four crowded hours of the day - W. Beran Wolfe
<br>
<br>
The differemce betweem perseverance and obstinancy is, that one comes from a strong will, and the other from a strong won't.  - Henry Ward Beecher
<br>
<br>
Don't let life discourge you; everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was.  Richard I. Evans
<br>
<br>
I am an optimist.  It does not seem too much use being anything else.  Winston Churchill
<br>
<br>
Happiness sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.  - John Barrymore

..."I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his own opinion,however different that opinion might be to mine.He who denies to another this right,makes a slave of himself to his present opinion,because he precludes himself the right of changing it.The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason.I have never used any other,and I trust I never shall."  THOMAS PAINE

Lederer in Time to Heal states that physicians are a product of the society that we live in. We live in a society of instant gratification. Few if any want to accept responsibility for their actions. Good patient care demands constant vigilance on the part of patient and physician. Often, in the process of good care, doctors and patients will be at odds with one another. I like what Lee Golusinski, MD had to say:
<br>
<br>
"When patients get upset and say I am being parental and coercive by doing this, I remind them that there are three names on each bottle of medication: the patient's, mine, and the pharmacist. We all have responsibilities on this team, and if one of us is not meeting those responsibilities (such as monitoring INRs for patients on coumadin), I will not take on the risk they bring by not meeting their responsibilities."

In the streets and in society I am almost invariably

cheap and dissipated, my life is unspeakably mean.
<br>
No amount of gold or respectability would in the least
<br>
redeem it,-- dining with the Governor or a member of Congress!!
<br>
But alone in the distant woods or fields,
<br>
in unpretending sprout-lands or pastures tracked by rabbits,
<br>
even in a bleak and, to most, cheerless day, like this,
<br>
when a villager would be thinking of his inn,
<br>
I come to myself, I once more feel myself grandly related,
<br>
and that cold and solitude are friends of mine.
<br>
I suppose that this value, in my case, is equivalent
<br>
to what others get by churchgoing and prayer.
<br>
I come home to my solitary woodland walk as the homesick go home.
<br>
I thus dispose of the superfluous and see things as they are,
<br>
grand and beautiful. I have told many that I walk every day
<br>
about half the daylight, but I think they do not believe it.

I wish to get the Concord, the Massachusetts, the America,

The following was taken from the 12 Monkeys film script.  Jeffrey is Brad Pitt's character and Cole is Bruce Willis.  THose of you who have seen this might get a laugh out of the following, if not, oh well, at least I did  (by the way, if you haven't seen this film, check it out, it's great!)
<br>
<br>
JEFFREY
<br>
Why don't I escape, that's what you
<br>
were going to ask me, right?  'Cause
<br>
I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken
<br>
care of, see?  I've sent out word.
<br>
COLE
<br>
What's that mean?
<br>
<br>
JEFFREY
<br>
I've managed to contact certain underlings,
<br>
evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
<br>
assorted minions, who will contact my father.
<br>
When he learns I'm in this kind of place,
<br>
classy joints where they treat you...properly.

Audi, R. 1992. Objective/Subjective. A Companion to Epistemology. J. Dancy and E. Sosa. Oxford, Blackwell: 309-310.
<br>
<br>
"The contrast between the subjective and the objective is made in both the epistemic and the ontological domains. In the former it is often identified with the distinction between the *intra*personal and the *inter*personal, or with that between matters whose resolution depends on the psychology of the person in question and those not thus dependent, or, sometimes, with the distinction between the biased and the impartial. Thus an objective question might be one answerable by a method usable by any competent investigator, while a subjective question would be answerable only from the questioner's point of view. In the ontological domain, the subjective-objective contrast is often between what is and what is not mind-dependent; secondary qualities, e.g., colours, have been thought subjective owing to their apparent variability with observation conditions. The truth of a proposition, for instance (apart from certain propositions about oneself), would be objective if it is independent of the perspective, especially the beliefs of those judging it. Truth would be subjective if it lacks such independence, say because it is a construct from justified beliefs, e.g. those well-confirmed by observations."

Chew on dat!

Here are a few I've either collected or otherwise have on hand:
<br>
<br>
<br>
The enemy is fear. We think it is hate; but it is fear.
<br>
--Gandhi
<br>
<br>
Mastering others requires force;
<br>
Mastering the self requires enlightenment.
<br>
--Lao Tzu
<br>
<br>
What a man thinks of himself, that is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.
<br>
--Henry David Thoreau
<br>
<br>
I've lived through many terrible things in my life,
<br>
some of which have actually happened.
<br>
--Mark Twain
<br>
<br>
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
<br>
--Thomas Edison
<br>
<br>
A truth that's told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent.
<br>
--William Blake
<br>
<br>
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.
<br>
--Albert Einstein
<br>
<br>
We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have
<br>
the life that is waiting for us.
<br>
--Joseph Campbell
<br>
<br>
If at first you don't succeed; try, try again. Then quit.  No use being a fool about it."
<br>
--W. C. Fields
<br>
<br>
There are three kinds of men: The one's that learn by reading, the few
<br>
who learn by observation...the rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves."
<br>
--Will Rogers
<br>
<br>
There is nothing noble about being superior to some other man.
<br>
The true nobility is in being superior to your previous self.
<br>
--Samuel Johnson
<br>
<br>
A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.
<br>
--Saul Bellow
<br>
<br>
Wise men learn more from fools than fools learn from wise men.
<br>
--Marcus Porcius Cato
<br>
<br>
It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings, who knows the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the high achievement of triumph and who at worst, if he fails while daring greatly, knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
<br>
--Theodore Roosevelt

Douglas Adams Book Quotes:
<br>
<br>
"`You know,' said Arthur, `it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die from asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.'

<br>
<br>
"`If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.'"

<br>
<br>
"`My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre, and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.'"

"Fear, its like this fire, burning inside of you. If you control it, it will make you HOT! But if you let it control you, it will burn you up." - Rocky IV
<br>
<br>
"I was suppose to be going to the shop to get bread for my family,
<br>
but on my way to the shop, it started raining and I discovered the
<br>
love of playing in the rain. Not until the wind blew away the rain
<br>
clouds, and the sun came out was it that I realised, I couldn't spend all my time playing in the rain when there was bread to get, so I resumed going to the shop. When the rain clouds come back, I will be able to play in the rain again, but I won't be able to stop and play in the rain, I can only play in the rain, on my way."
