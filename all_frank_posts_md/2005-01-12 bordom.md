<section>
I've noticed while meditating that it, well, gets boring.  The same goes for attempting OBE or breath awareness exercises, etc.  Does anyone have any tips to get past this bordom to progress further?  It's like your sitting there doing it, and all the sudden you just don't want to do it anymore, like it's studying or something.  I'm sure that if I can get past this stage there is something waiting beyond it, but it's so hard.  Is there anything that makes it more interesting while still maintaining the excercise, or do you just have to suck it up and push through?

To meditate, you need to clear your mind of thoughts &amp; feelings, and just be calm and at peace.
<br>
<br>
If you can feel bored, then you're not meditating properly. Treat boredom as just another annoying distraction and push it out of your mind.

I would also add to astralspinners advice that meditating for long periods is something which comes with practice and experience. You can't expect to sit and meditate for hours when just starting out. 10-15 minutes a day is a good start. If during that period you ever get restless and feel a need to stop, then stop. If you force yourself and become increasingly bored, meditation will turn into a chore.
<br>
I sometime feel boredom too. But that gives me an avenue to explore. Why am I actually feeling the emotion/mental state boredom in the current situation etc.

I agree - try to block the distraction out. If you can't, then stop and try again later.
<br>
<br>
Whilst you don't want it to become a chore, a level of discipline is required. Try once in the morning, &amp; once in the evening, for 5 mins. Try this for a week. If this seems easy, do it for a month. Regular practise is important IMO.
<br>
Its like going to the gym; doing a huge 2 hour stint, once every 3 or 4 months, isn't going to improve your fitness !

Perhaps the feeling of not wanting to do it is more about the human-mind side of you not wanting to lose control ?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps you need to try different methods to what you are using now ?  If it's not working for you, then you need to find what will.  You could try the projection method in my web pages that you can get to by clicking the link below for Geocities, then the Spiritual link at Simple Spirit to find the description.
<br>
<br>
I think the motivation for OBE is important too.  Ask yourself exactly why you want to OBE and be honest with you about it.  Why is important.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, everything is dependent on timing.  If it is not time for you to experience then no matter what you do you will not get out.

<br>
Absolutely. If you can't get rid of the boredom, stop. Don't make it unpleasant for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, take breaks - stop meditating, and just daydream for a while. Think about something fun. This will help to get rid of the boredom, while still leaving you relaxed, so when you're ready to begin meditating again, you're already part of the way there.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
If I may say I think you should concentrate more. It sounds to me like you are just sitting there expecting something to happen. I think you should take a more involving stance. Become more, as the Americans would say, pro-active. I think your mind is confused as well about what you are expecting from it. Perhaps work on giving yourself more clear directions. Goal-setting, I think is the term. That'll make it more exciting, rather than just sitting there expecting something to pop up.
<br>
<br>

Yours,
<br>

This sounds helpful, except, what do you think some good examples of clear directions and goals for this would be?

Dream journals are
<i>
 invaluable
</i>
for setting and monitoring specific goals in altered states of consciousness. It's a challenging, but extremely rewarding activity.
<br>
<br>
AlphaOmega, if you're bored meditating, don't do it. Boredom is a signal that you're neglecting what you find interesting and meaningful.
<br>
<br>
Brain imaging studies have shown that certain creative and successful people have the brain-wave patterns characteristic of meditation going all the time. Some people who are going after their dreams don't need to meditate.
