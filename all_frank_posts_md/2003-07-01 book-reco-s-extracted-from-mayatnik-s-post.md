<section>
<br>
<br>
Mayatnik: very kindly gave the following list in answer to one of my posts. So for clarity, I thought he wouldn't mind me reproducing the list here, with his accompanying overview of the works.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 For books on the origins of mankind and alien contact, he recommends:
</b>
<br>
<br>
Robert Temple's &lt;THE SIRIUS MYSTERY: New scientific evidence for Alien contact 5,000 years ago&gt;
<br>
<br>
Alan F. Alford's &lt;GODS OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM: The shattering Truth of human origins&gt;
<br>
<br>
Peter Le Mesurier's &lt;GODS OF THE DAWN: The Message of the Pyramids and the True Stargate Mystery&gt;
<br>
<br>
David Furlong's &lt;THE KEYS TO THE TEMPLE: Pyramids, Ley Patterns and the Atlantean Heritage&gt;
<br>
<br>
Mark Vidler's &lt;THE STAR MIRROR: The extraordinary discovery of the Reflections between Heaven and Earth&gt;
<br>
<br>
Ann Madden Jones'
<br>
&lt;THE YAHWEH ENCOUNTERS: Bible Astronauts, Ark Radiations and Temple Electronics&gt;
<br>
<br>
The cover of the above book states clearly:
<br>
"This is NOT Science-Fiction" – and the author is certainly no 'crank', possessing degrees from two major US Universities. She rips apart the conventional fabric of the Bible in this controversial book that examines, from an expert view of Nuclear-Physics, the events surrounding the giving of the Ten Commandments and exactly what happened regarding the Ark of the Covenant (as a result of which misuse 64,000 people died) and detailing much that, in this scientific investigation of great depth, cannot be ignored regarding Extra-Terrestrial involvement in the early history of the Jewish people.
<br>
<br>
What we find in all of the above excellently compiled works (often taking years of painstaking research at source) is a vast wealth of proof that very high technology was used in the creation of such as the pyramids to a degree of accuracy that cannot even to this day be matched by our so-called hi-tech society, quite apart from the sheer impossibility of even our sophisticated machinary to transport and errect stones at great height on top of other stones, each one weighing up to 200 tons. Similarly, looking at sites such as Stonehenge and other ancient 'sacred' locations we find – according to the best surveyors who researched and wrote their conclusions – that they are all built according to what is called 'Sacred Geometry', and that they fit exactly onto a twin overlapping circles if drawn on a map. This is precision of the highest order, and begs the question as to why they should have been sited accordingly and also along ley lines. Other sites around the world exhibit the same high degree of precision – some, indeed, could only have been planned from outer space because their symmetry of lines in absolute accuracy is not obvious at ground level where they cover many miles. So, we have not only been visited, it must be concluded, but also helped in this and many other things in our history. When the reader has perused in detail the contents of these serious works the reaction must be a gasp leading to awe at what man has blithely been unaware of until recently. I present the above merely as a 'pen-sketch' background to dealing with your main question, for it to be better understood.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 And for books regarding the Pleiadians:
</b>
<br>
<br>
I leave you on that thought, with a list of channeled books my guide recommends for the reader to gain a good backround to all of this.
<br>
<br>
Barbara Marciniak's
<br>
&lt;BRINGERS OF THE DAWN: Teachings from the Pleiadians&gt;
<br>
&lt;FAMILY OF LIGHT: Pleiadian Tales and Lessons in Living&gt;
<br>
<br>
Amorah Quan Yin's
<br>
&lt;PLEIADIAN PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN EVOLUTION&gt;
<br>
<br>
Barbara Hand Clow's
<br>
&lt;THE PLIEADIAN AGENDA: A New Cosmology for the Age of Light&gt;
<br>
<br>
Nina Jenice's
<br>
&lt;A PLEIADIAN IN TIME: A Time Traveller&gt;
<br>
<br>
Other channeled books, not directly about the Pleiadians themselves but of related Higher Beings from other Star Constellations, are listed below:
<br>
<br>
Dr. Norma J. Milanovich's
<br>
&lt;WE THE ARCTURIANS: A True Experience&gt;
<br>
<br>
Psychologist and Channeler Murry Hope's
<br>
&lt;THE LION PEOPLE: Intercosmic Messages from the Future&gt;
<br>
&lt;THE PASHCATS AND THE CRYSTAL PEOPLE&gt;
<br>
<br>
Ida M. Kannenberg's
<br>
&lt;PROJECT EARTH: From the ET Perspective&gt;
<br>
<br>
Of a different 'type' of channeling (through Regression Hypnosis) are the two following books which not only correlate closely but also bring together many hitherto confused aspects of Reincarnation, and what a 'spirit' really is and does when not down here on Earth, and what really happens in that well-ordered 'other world' beyond our perception [These books are the collated transcripts of hundreds of tapes from actual regressions that turned out to be channelings and which closely correlated with each other, although each was totally independent – the results are presented verbatim with comments by this world renowned and experienced Regressionist]......
<br>
<br>
Dolores Cannon's
<br>
&lt;BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH: Conversations with a Spirit&gt;
<br>
&lt;KEEPERS OF THE GARDEN: An Extra-Terrestrial Document&gt;
<br>
<br>
Whether you initially 'believe' or want to believe in Aliens that Man mistakenly came to call 'The Gods', you will be gripped by the words of all the above channeled works. The whole 'background' is unfolded gently and with Loving Compassion by the guides through their 'vehicles' who wrote down what was told to them Telepathically. Even for the hardened skeptic, these channeled books make ideal 'bed-time' reading because they are invariably soothing and give a new meaning to our existence on this Earth. Enjoy!
<br>
<br>
With Pleiadian Love and Light,
<br>
MAYATNIK

<section>
Thanks for the post Frank. I did go ahead and order two of the books:
<i>
 Bringers of the Dawn
</i>
and
<i>
 The Pleiadian Agenda
</i>
. Frankly, I know next to nothing about all this, however am looking forward to reading about it.
<br>
<br>
With respect to all the posts and activity on the pendulum at the Astral Consciousness forum, I don't know. For some reason I don't feel compelled to use a pendulum at this time. Maybe later, who knows?
<br>
<br>
Very best,

<br>
<br>
Yep, I know how you feel Nick. But it has certainly given me some food for thought.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to try and make contact with these people within some non-physical realm. No luck as yet. But as I said to Douglas in a recent PM, anything new always tends to take me ages to get my head around. Naturally, I will keep everyone informed.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<section>
Greetings Frank,
<br>
<br>
Just a thought, but can't Harath assist you in this quest? I seem to recall you saying that he himself has never incarnated on Earth?
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
<br>
<br>
Adrian: you are quite correct.
<br>
<br>
Last time Harath and I met was about 3 weeks ago. I've been going "freestyle" since. However, I tried to make contact the past two mornings but to no avail. He knows I need him for something specific, and getting a straight answer from him is like getting blood out of a stone.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
If Harath doesn't come tomorrow I'm going to call on, "Freda" my other guide, and see if she has any ideas.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Greetings Frank,
<br>
<br>
When you are in astral you could try to reach Great Pyramid of Giza
<br>
inner center to  increase you frequency. That might allow you to reach certain planes. There is a protection around the place, to block unnessesary access. But I feel that there will be nothing stoping you from entry.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,
<br>
<br>
Osiris.

<br>
Osiris: Thank you for your advice. As I say, anything new tends to take me ages to get my head around. So right now I need all the pointers I can get.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.

Yours,
