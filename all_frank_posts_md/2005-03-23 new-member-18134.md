Hi,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
This forum has grown quite a lot in the last few years. There are lots of topics and posts, so it can be a bit daunting at first. What I would recommend is to start out by reading over our
<b>
 FAQ Forum
</b>
. That should answer some questions, and also hopefully, make for a few more.
<br>
<br>
Feel free to jump in and participate at any time, We'll look forward to your involvement here.
<br>
