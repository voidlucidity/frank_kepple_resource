I have become wery interested in Kunadlini lately, it seems to be a wery
<br>
potent way of raising energy. Dose anybody know more about it?
<br>
Perhaps if someone out there is practicing, it would be wery nice if you could sum up a short tutorial- I would just love to try working with kundalini, but have no money at al right now, so buying a book about to learn it is out of the question right now. So basically I´m dependent on some kind soul telling me how to do it.

Distant bell &amp; Grenade01
<br>
<br>
a friend of mine told me that when he came back from India after visiting his guru he met a devotee of a kundalini yoga ashram on the plane. She was heading home and was quite distraught over her time in India. When questioned she said that her guru raised the kundalini in his devotees. He was always trying to get her to give in to his method, finally she agreed to have him raise her kundalini.
<br>
<br>
She then said that he made her have the biggest orgasm she had ever had, in front of everyone, she had never been so embarrassed or humiliated. She left the ashram as soon as she could. She said that she felt violated. She never told him how the guru did it though.
<br>
<br>
From my understanding of kundlani through tantra, it is just sexual energy, moving or flowing though the whole body rather then just the genitals. Tantra is basically training yourself to use this sexual energy through lots of exercises and meditations. There are heaps of web sites on tantra, but few with any real information, lots of people think tantra is just prolonged sex, but it is more than that. Good luck.

<section>
astalc: kundalin isn't just sexual energy. it is energy of the spine. using it can give the user "good feelings" but so can almost any form of energy if it is used in certain ways. but i do agree that one should be cautious; i have read some stories on the internet about extremely disastrous kundalin awakenings. and the few web sites that i did visit almost all said that it is quite common for kundalin awakenings to be filled with some sort of negative aspects and experiences.
<br>
<br>
distant bell: try sitting in a rigid meditative position, with the spine ABSOLUTELY straight, most importantly the backbone that runs through your neck and into the base of you head. then try focusing on just your spine. after a few seconds of focusing on it, you should feel something slightly "weird" going on in it. when you feel this, slowly take a deep breathe and as you inhale close your eyes and try to make the "weird" feeling move up your spine, starting from the small of your back (actually start from whereever feels natural. if you don't know where it feels natural to start from, start from the small of your back). if you get it right, you should get a feeling akin to the feeling you get from a really good sneeze, but probably less powerful. then try moving the energy back down the spine. and know that, for me at least, it feels different going down than it does going up so don't think that something wrong it happening if it does feel different.
<br>
<br>
hope this helps. if not say so and i will see what i can do about finding some web pages for ya.

i look at kundalini as energy from meditation, that flows when you still the mind and relax the body.the only group that i remember that did intense kundalini work was Yogi Bhajan's. i think he taught a lot of breathing stuff(pranayana) that directly worked on kundalini.the most intense experience i had was from focusing on my heart chakra- just pull in cosmic energy through your crown and earth energy through your feet or first chakra and focus it in your heart.

There's a saying "be careful what you ask for, you may just get it."
<br>
<br>
This is not an energy that you can dabble with.  It requires respect in the extreme and you can expect to become mentally and possibly physically transformed by it.

  I have to agree with Observer.  Kundalini is not something that can be played with and then put away - it will transform your life.  In most cases it makes it difficult to 'live in the real world'.  I had a friend who raised his Kundalini without any bad physical side effects.  He had a Guru and was practicing the breathing and Yoga for 3 hours a day.  His wife threatened to leave him as he gradually 'withdrew' from the physical world - was even dangerous for him to drive as he always seemed to be in a trance.  Unless you live in a Monastery or commune and want to devote your whole life to spiritual practice - then forget it.

There is another saying to " do not paint the devil on the wall"
<br>
<br>
I do not think that kundalini is much different than NEW - and we all play
<br>
around with NEW don´t we..
<br>
It´s a energy raising method- not a way to invoce great satan.

Something ive read about Kundalini in The Wiccan Mysteries by Raven Grimassi.
<br>
<br>
This comes from a chapter on sex magic
<br>
<br>
...Another goal is to raise a form of power from the base of the spine. In this area resides the Kundalini or serpent energy...(insert christian church knowlede restriction cliche here

Hi all.
<br>
<br>
I am not sure, but it seems to me from the reading/research I have done on vatious kinds of magick, that Kundalini is activating the lower chakra. I believe Freud referred to it as "Orgone".  Robert warns about "playing around" with it. I have read other places that you should initialize from the top down, to remove the "sex" that goes with that power center. Those sources say if you start at the groin area, activate that chakra and the rest are not ready to "come on line" and absorb the enrgy it can create various problems.
<br>
<br>
I have "played around" with initializing different chakras first to see the effects. I do not recomend starting there. I was able to send the energy through my system when I started there, but it was not easy (to even the flow), and it took awhile to remove the "lust" that came before the power spread out. If I start in other places and then go there it is not a problem. No sexual overtones. And yes you do become a little less attached to the physical, but for me it causes no interference with living, more of an enlightenment, and a "reality check" of whats really going on.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes.
<br>

Hmm
<br>
From what I gather (from reading a lot of hindu literature...although Im retarded so dont quote me)
<br>
Generally a kundalini awakening brings energy up your spine  all the way to the top of the head.  Its often referred to like a serpent coiling up the tree of life or something like that.. I guess the leaves and branches would symbolize the way a crown activation causes energy to sort of sprinkle over you.  It seems like kundalini refers to a more volatile inner energy then that of the easy going energy we suck up through our hands and feet.
<br>
some say that hatha and kriya yoga can help
<br>
but I dont know
<br>
I rarely feel energy in my spine, but on the few occasions I have...its been a bit weird
<br>
Ive been focusing a lot on my spine lately...

I wouldn't bonk around with Kundalini if you don't *know* what you are doing. I'd recommend to just let it happen as you progress on the spiritual path. It's a natural energy - It'll happen when it needs to happen.
<br>
<br>
Read Robert's article on Kundalini, and there's a good example of someone pushing it out, not letting it out. It's possible to go insane if you push it too far.

<section>
I have read lots of warnings about Kundalini, yet I have not seen really any examples of the dangers. Yes I have heard lots of statements about the possibility of going insane, etc. Some would say that Jesus and other spiritual leaders were insane. Are these just fears that people spread due to lack of actual knowledge or for control? There are those that say astral projection is evil, you will get lost and not be able to get back, etc. Now I am not saying that Kundalini energy may not be dangerous. My point is that I would just like to find the truth and get past any possible myths. Where is Robert's article on Kundalini. I do not think I have seen it, though I could have just missed it.
<br>
<br>
My suggestion to you is that if you are interested in it then learn as much as you can about it and then practice and learn for yourself. As long as you go slow I do not see what harm can come. If something starts to feel wrong then stop and learn what is wrong. Good Luck!

<section>
Greetings all, seems to be a lot of confusion in regards to kundalini, chakra's, energy raising ext. I haven't great expeirance of these things.
<br>
I look at the hole thing like a "garden watering system" (and no, I dont take drugs) , think of it this way.  Youv'e got,    TAP (water supply=energy)   HOSE ( kundalini )   SPRINKLER HEADS ( chakra's )     GARDEN ( self, spiritual growth )
<br>
Now, everything is in place to nurture the garden.  If we turn the tap on a little the water will come out of the sprinkler heads. If you dont know the requirments of the plants in the garden it takes a lot of fiddling with the sprinkler heads to get the right balance.
<br>
Now, If we just turn the tap fully open, youv'e got the chance that you might blow the hose and pop the splinkler heads, this could have an adverse affect on the garden.
<br>
I suppose what I'm trying to say is that we must know what the garden wants, custom build your sprinkler system, it takes time, really look at the garden, make a strong hose then turn up the pressure.
<br>
<br>
I cant believe I used the analogy of a sprinkler system, it just came out.
<br>
<br>

Hi junkie
<br>
<br>
No, my recomendation is to start at the crown chakra and awaken each chakra coming down. This way your energy system is better able to "recieve" the energy. And it should avert the problem(s) that come from starting with the kundalini and moving up. This works for me, and how I was taught. But it was not by a "guru", just someone who new there energy systems.
<br>
<br>
With the warnings I have heard, make sure you know what you are doing.
<br>
<br>
best wishes

Expecting trouble before setting out does not help any more than starting out without any idea of what will be involved. A teacher of mine told me that there is no way to prepare for kundalini or to control it in any way. Kundalini seems to bring pain and disruption with it and many people say that it almost killed them, but it also seems to bring with it the information needed on what to do to get through it. Actually, the biggest troubles don't seem to be the physical pain (which my teacher told me was so bad as to keep him from standing up at times and which he described as having his body re-shaped a little at a time). The most of the suffering seems to be the emotional and mental re-arrangements. Being around other people can aggravate this. My teacher had problems when going to work, and customer service was not a good field for him to have been in during the worst of it. When I told my teacher about having read something on chakras or kundalini or energy or even meditation he would usually just laugh at me for taking it seriously. He said that most of the stuff I read was completely irrelevent.

Ides315: But then I've heard that can be dangerous as it brings to much energy to the brow which supposedly can also cause you to go insane.
<br>
<br>
I don't think it's really important how you do it, as long as you listen to your body and mind, if you feel anything unpleasant beyond a slight discomfort or notice any negative effects of course quit what your doing and try something else.  I think experimenting is okay though as long as you don't push it..... Im not afraid of kundalini  Ive read a few hindu books that talk about how some people would pin dangers on kundalini awakenings and they say its basically rubbish, but usually they do suggest you have a guru to help deal with it..So I dont know... I dont have a guru, but then I never really have for anything ...other than books and forums.  May as well give it a shot.
<br>
<br>
So last night I was meditating.  I started with NEW for a bit.  I reached a trance very quickly, unintentionally (often by the time Im done with my NEW routine I am in a full trance)  my energy body was very receptive last night.  When I was done drawing all the energy I focused more on specifically opening each center (from bottom up..all of them! hehe)  I felt like the energy was flowing pretty well So then I began to use a kundalini meditation.  The actual meditation said visualize a snake coiling up your spine or something, and breathe deep, but more importantly slowely.  I didnt visualize the snake, but instead kind of used a method more like NEW to draw energy up my spine.  At first I felt like there was a drop of warm water by my tailbone, then as I was drawing it upwards it felt like the water was slowely dripping up my back.  Each time I hit an energy center, it would begin to midly vibrate..except for my throat which suddenly felt very uncomfertable and constricted (Ive suspected I have big time energy blockages in my throat for a while now though) At this point I couldnt get it above my neck, I figured it was because my head wasnt straight but rather kinked to the side to avoid to much slobber buildup (they always talk about the spine needing to be perfectly straight)  So I moved my head so that my spine was straight..it took me out of the trance momentarily but it only took about 20 or so seconds to return to this state.  when the dripping water feeling reached the back of my head and then the top, I felt my brow become open and the top of my head started vibrating like the others, only it gave off a faint deep low pitched hum. At this point my whole body felt like it was submerged in warm, vibrating water...it was very odd.  This is kind of embarrasing but i had an experience kind of like AstralC's friend Hrmmm I didnt just admit that.... it felt more like a full body orgasm though than like merely a sexual one (kind of like the effects of the drug ecstasy) At this point It was getting a bit intense (my energy centers felt kind of hot weird)  I kept having random parts of my body float out of body..like a leg or an arm.  Although I did not achieve a full out of body.  Also I had this feeling like I had a big ball around my head..like a hot energy ball (kind of like those pictures of saints with the halos) it was a weird feeling.  The more I focused on it the more my Awareness began to withdraw into this ball.  I felt like I was almost becoming the ball.  Im certain if I would have focused on the ball I could have moved all my awareness to it and Astral projected into possibly a high realm.  But I was a bit afraid I was taking it to fast so I stopped the session right there.  (i Know boo boo haha but seriously that was a lot for one new type of meditation and I didnt want to cause any problems)
<br>
<br>
That was it. I had only about 6 hours of sleep and I feel great (usually I need about 10)
<br>
I may or may not give it a shot tonight
<br>
Im thinking about just doing my normal routine for a few days before I try again just incase...

I was combining new with a kundalini method actually
<br>
It was like the NEW stimulated something else, but I also mentally imagined a hum (like Aum/om) and rolled my eyes up to point at my brow center.
<br>
<br>
I felt some big time blockages the likes of which ive never felt before, so I think I may have possibly had a taste of kundalini, but not really a true experience with it.  my throat center felt really messed up and i felt held back by a few other spots that i wasnt willing just yet to force clear

Tom - I can see why your teacher said that this stuff is irrelevant - it really is, in long term spiritual development. All it's doing is taking your focus off the most important stuff...I guess you could call it love. It's easy to get sidetracked into filling your head with knowledge, because your mind is stimulated by it. But it doesn't matter....all the knowledge you need right now, and will ever need, is in your heart.
<br>
<br>
Grenade - The throat center is the center of your will...and you can't clear every type of energy blockage with NEW - you've got to into your heart, and ask yourself why you have chosen to deny youself love. Because, as that saying goes, "The answer to every question is love."

And it's true...

Grenade- Thats great! Y´ou have really inspired me!
<br>
<br>
Hm.. I talked to a girl who has used Kundalini- and basically what
<br>
she told me was to just sit down meditating and draw energy up the spine.
<br>
This made me thing about Robert Bruce, NEW and spinal energy bouncing.
<br>
I can´t se that there should be any great difference between NEW and kundalini. Indian religion/mysticism is wery full of supertsticion to. And it all comes down to symbols. The kundalini snake is a symbol for the quality of the energy. Might it be that we create the energy in the way we whant it?
<br>
Like this- if you expect something all powerfull and strange like Kundalini- you´ll form the energy into that- if you expect something less supersticious, like NEW, you create a different kind of energy..
<br>
After all... the energy surely is created by the mind in the body..

A great topic with a great response
<br>
<br>
I do tai chi and taoist meditations, have for the past 22 years. I had an awakening some years back when I deliberately meditated on my heart chakra, really pushed the chi breathing through it.
<br>
<br>
After four days of doing the chi breathing my heart just exploded, I mean I vibrated on my bed like I was hit by an electric current, it lasted about a minute. Wow, was I high! I then proceded to do this every day until I got really sensitive, I could open my heart chakra at will, but the side-effect was that my heart got too sensitive and led to panic attacks. I had to back off on it.
<br>
<br>
The Toaist and Chinese Kung Fu tradition is to train the body and energy to flow through the navel chakra and feet first. The student or apprentice was not alowed to move beyond their belly button for about 4 years. This established an 'earthing', an ability to disipate excess kundalini. Its like an electric appliance with an earth wire.
<br>
<br>
I did all this years ago, but when I opened up my heart chakra I went overboard because it felt so good. I recommend you start at the feet first just for this reason. Safety first.
<br>
<br>
And what does kundalini feel like for me? It is like electricity shooting right through my body, from my feet all the way out through my head. I do it automatically when asleep, it induces astral travelling.
<br>
<br>
If I come back from OOB too early I come back to really itchy thighs and legs because the kundalini is still pumping through me.

HIYA, tried the method, but no results. HMM spent a while raising energy into bottom of spine kind of area, and got a sort of orgasmic effect.  What method did you use exactly? Also, I don't think I'm raising very much energy when I do NEW, is there anyway I can improve this?

But No..Im a quite well balanced person..I never feel anger...rarely feel sad..and Im usually pretty easy going and patient.  Hmm beats me .  As for being irrelevent to spiritual development..Well That doesn't bother me because it really has very little to do with my spiritual development.  I am a slightly spiritual person..I am always contimplating my views and such... and evolving...but my interests in the metiphysical are mostly for exploration and interest.  Also I feel meditation really helps my concentration and personality.  So

Grenada-
<br>
What posture did you use /do you use. When working with kundalini the
<br>
back has to be rally straight, and I guess it´s quite usuall to do it in Lotus or simply cross leged on the floor. But NEW is usually easier with straight legs.
<br>
I always do NEW sitting on my couch, ansd meditation sitting cross leged on the floor. I really think there might be alot to the posture.. But the idea of combining NEW and meditation? Then I guess sitting on a chair might be the best. But since you got such a great result- perhaps you had the right posture! So how did you sit?

<br>
<br>
that kundalini stuff is sure powerful isn't it. Funnily enough, the night after my last post after thinking about exactly what really happens to me when it rushes through my body, I had a dream and ...
<br>
<br>
I was dreaming that my wife was driving along a bush track, my two boys were with us in the back of the 4 Wheel drive, when, she drove over a cliff! I didn't say "bloody women driver!", but it was frightening!
<br>
<br>
It all went black, I mean pitch black (never remember this bit before), and as we fell, and fell and fell, it went on forever, I realised we would die. When that thought entered my head I stoppped being scared and grabbed the kids and my wife to me and told them not to be frightened. But we kept falling and falling, it felt strangely nice, even though we were falling to our deaths.
<br>
<br>
Just then I woke up, some dogs outside were fighting. I woke up right in the middle of leaving my body, so I was able, for the first time ever, to analyse the process I use to OOB.
<br>
<br>
I could feel the kundalini really strong in my feet, up my leags and into my torso, then it was like a fire hose rushing out the top of my head. It was buzzing and slightly vibrating. And again, itchy all over my legs and thighs, very annoying. But I was fascinated, I had never been awake when I left my body like this before, not right in the middle of it.
<br>
<br>
Nearly all my OOB and astral travel experiences have been when I had fallen asleep, even in meditation, I rarely leave my body unless I am so deep that I am unaware of the actual leaving bit.
<br>
<br>
Thought I would share this with you.

I was just laying flat on my back. I mentioned when it happened my neck wasnt straight and I had trouble getting it past that...so I moved it to be straight at the sacrifice of bringing myself out of the trance a bit for a while, and I was able to bring the energy up to my head..
<br>
So I think the spine does need to be straight, although I have nodea if legs play a part in it
<br>
seems like it would help if they were straight as well too, but then yogi's always use lotus so i dunno

G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
In case you don't know, I raised my kundalini to its highest level (full serpent path with full medusa effect), in 1987, and many times since. So, I know a bit about kundalini through personal experience.  I have only seen a couple of posts on this topic in this thread that contain some kind of sense. This is no slight on the posters, re there is widespread misunderstanding in the Western world concerning kundalini.
<br>
<br>
I am currently writing a 'Treatise on Kundalini', and hope to have it ready in about a week.  This will help eliminate some misconceptions.
<br>
<br>
If anyone is game, and wants to receive emails and compile kundalini related questions into a single post, Q's and A's, I will gladly reply to all your concerns. (Someone give me an email to let me know if this happens, or email Adrian at forum admin)
<br>
<br>
A few statements on kundalini.....
<br>
<br>
Kundalini is not a raise once and its done kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini can raise in 5 well known ways, with its highest path being the serpent of fire path.
<br>
<br>
K's primary pathway involves the serpent of fire. This feels like a real physical snake the size of a man's wrist is forcing its way up through your body (starting at the perrineum), 3.5 coils through your body and then up through your neck and head.  This is a 'very' noticeable sensation. You will feel your organs and intestines being moved (sloshing about) as this happens, as they are moved out of the way.
<br>
<br>
The internal kundalini sensations are caused by an internal manifestation (very strong and solid), of ectoplasm.
<br>
<br>
But today, most of the literature I see on kundalini says that the 'serpent of fire' is a symbolic thing, with various meanings given. This is bs, as its what k actually feels like.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini can be very painful and burning in the early stages. This gets easier to handle and less painful each time you do it.  This is possible only if you do not lose your mind through poor preparation.
<br>
<br>
The moment kundalini rises, your body will experience full physical shock. Your bowels will let go, re the need for cleansing practices like fasting and enemas to avoid this.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini, fully raised, comes with abstract realization.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini, especially the first time, will often come with a deity or initiation experience containing deities. This seems affected by the beliefs of the person raising kundalini.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini needs to be developed. It is energy dependent, just like the OBE or Vision Screen states.
<br>
<br>
It is not, as said, a raise once and its done kinda thing. This is total bs.
<br>
<br>
If you cannot do a full wake induced real time OBE, with full reentry, it is highly unlikely you will be able to induce a full kundalini rising. OBE is far, far easier.  If you disagree with this; dream on.........
<br>
<br>
When kundalini is fully raised a few times, and some development is in hand, the full 'Aummmm' effect will be experienced, as will the 'Medusa Effect'.
<br>
<br>
My next major book, after MAP (Mastering Astral Projection, which is well underway) will probably be 'Kundalini Dynamics'.
<br>
<br>
The secrecy surrounding kundalini today is an enigma.  I know thousands of people and, being an author, have respect and credibility.  But, you know what, I have yet to meet anyone who has actually 'raised' kundalini.  I have been introduced to a number of yoga masters who have claimed for many years to have raised kundalini and be 'realized', but, you know what, they don't want to talk with me.
<br>
<br>
I have raised kundalini many times and yes, it does change you greatly.  How do you think I went from a dirt poor cripple with no education (I left school afer grade
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
to a famous author with such incredible insight???
<br>
<br>
Kundalini releases the genious with, and increases your potential dramatically.
<br>
<br>
And, if you have good advise and survive the process, physically and mentally, you 'will' be changed profoundly and all that jazz.
<br>
<br>
I worked out kundalini for myself, with no instruction.  I should have died, but I did not.  Now, I walk with angels and think at levels even I do not understand.
<br>
<br>
God bless you all, Robert.

Hi Robert,
<br>
<br>
I look forward to your treatise on Kundalini. Kundalini is not on my 'to do' list, but it is still
<b>
 most
</b>
interesting as a part of the human experience. Fascinating.
<br>
<br>
Since so few people have raised kundalini and since it is a profound experience, do you (or did you) grapple with the question "Who is the crazy one here?"  Any thoughts on what constitutes 'crazy?'
<br>
<br>
more technical questions:
<br>
<br>
How long did it take for the fist-sized serpent to work it's way from the perineum to your head?
<br>
<br>
Were the 'results' of kundalini (genius, etc) an effect
<i>
 during
</i>
the experience or did they come about later?
<br>
<br>
How long were you meditating beforehand, and were you seeking to raise kundalini?  how many attempts (or what time frame beforehand were you attempting this) before the 1987 success?
<br>
<br>
During the serpent of fire path, were you willing to have the process continue? Or did you want it to stop but once initiated it couldn't?
<br>
<br>
I'll also email my questions to Adrian, it sounds like you might not check the thread.
<br>
<br>
Again, thank you for your contribution, on the thread and in general.
<br>
<br>
On a separate note, are there any photos of you that I could use to 'check' against one of my novice projections?

Robert
<br>
<br>
I agree with what you have said regarding kindalini. I have, like you, experienced many times the raising of kundalini, since 1981. Some of my comments have been included in this post. I have used traditional taoist techniques to do this which perhaps you have not heard of, or perhaps you have in your reasearch for this topic.
<br>
<br>
In my experience there was no opening of bowels, entities or initiations, perhaps that is just my path. It happens to me after specific movements of chi through the body and often at night when asleep when I OOB. Perhaps I have been doing tai chi for so long that I don't need entities or initiations, or maybe I am bs myself, though I know what I can and can't do.
<br>
<br>
I agree, there are so few people who can really do this, many talk about it but few walk the walk. It is definitely not a 'one off', it happens regularly. Some people experience it through sex and orgasm. It can change you, sure does, but it is not immediate enlightenment, just a great feeling with nice effects which can lead to enlightenment.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to your treatise on kundalini. I will email you too.

G'day Patty!
<br>
<br>
Since so few people have raised kundalini and since it is a profound experience, do you (or did you) grapple with the question "Who is the crazy one here?"  Any thoughts on what constitutes 'crazy?'
<br>
<br>
The definition of crazy is very subjective.  For many years I have been considered as a crazy mad scientist type person. But now I am just considered a little strange:)
<br>
<br>
more technical questions:
<br>
<br>
How long did it take for the fist-sized serpent to work it's way from the perineum to your head?
<br>
<br>
The actual serpent phenomenon only takes about ten seconds or so to rise.
<br>
<br>
Were the 'results' of kundalini (genius, etc) an effect
<i>
 during
</i>
the experience or did they come about later?
<br>
<br>
The first time I did this my mind expanded, but I would not say I experienced realization.  The second time, about a week later, my mind was again expanded. This expansion process continued until I experienced the full 'medusa' and 'Aummm' effects, where I then experienced full abstract realization.
<br>
<br>
Abstract realization means exactly what it says.  At such a time one knows everything in the abstract, but cannot put it into words after the realized state passes. After this, bits and pieces of knowledge will surface now and zen, especially during trance meditation and when using the writing process.  Basically, one becomes very creative, intuitive and insightful.
<br>
<br>
Another side effect of raised kundalini was greatly enhanced empathy, intuition and psychic abilities. At this level these are quite troublesome and disturbing.  After raising kundalini a dozen or so times, I took a year off from everything, to give my mind and senses time to adapt.  If I had not done so I would have gone mad.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini is a two-edged sword.  While it greatly expands mind and abilities, it also opens one to an onslaught of impressions that are very hard to live with.  I was very lucky to survive what I did, and would not recommend anyone copy me.  A great deal more training and preparation is advised.
<br>
<br>
I do not yet know the full extent of the realization process, but suspect it can be developed into a profound state of knowing.
<br>
<br>
How long were you meditating beforehand, and were you seeking to raise kundalini?  how many attempts (or what time frame beforehand were you attempting this) before the 1987 success?
<br>
<br>
From start to finish, it took me about a month.  I started with an eleven day water fast, then moved to one three-day water fast per week.  I made a kundalini raising attempt on the third day of each fast, when my energy levels peaked.  The first time, I had been trance meditating and raising energy for about seven hours without a break. Yes, I was intending to raise kundalini.
<br>
<br>
During the serpent of fire path, were you willing to have the process continue? Or did you want it to stop but once initiated it couldn't?
<br>
<br>
I stopped the first major even, which was a massive kundalini spike up my spine.  After a few minutes, I did it again and released the serpent. Once released I could not have stopped it if I had tried, it was way too powerful and just took control over me.
<br>
<br>
Note that the first time was very shocking and painful.  I think I died at this time and had a NDE type of experience.  Then I came back to earth and was physically ok, but very shaken.
<br>
<br>
The next time I did it, about a week later, it was only a little painful and etc, but still just as powerful, with no NDE or OBE or etc.
<br>
<br>
Each time I did it, the experienced grew less stressful and more profound.
<br>
<br>
On a separate note, are there any photos of you that I could use to 'check' against one of my novice projections?
<br>
<br>
You will find a picture of me on my website, under 'About Robert Bruce'. But please read the warning before viewing, re nudity offends some people.
<br>
<br>
Note, I still raise kundalini occasionally, infrequently, but I gave up my high level mystical and kundalini work several years ago, to devote my full time and energy to writing.  I also did not have the facilities to continue, and have had to limit myself to trance meditation and OBE and etc. But I plan to get back into my more serious work later this year, when I have the time and facilities, and will then explore the kundalini phenomenon thoroughly.
<br>
<br>
By facilities, all I need is a soundproof air conditioned room where I will not be disturbed for several hours at a time.  Being a single father with children, cooking and cleaning and and writing and etc,  has not allowed me the simple luxury of this seemingly fundamental facility. However, life is changing for me and I can now forsee changes where I will have all I need to continue my work.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

Robert, here is the question i have about kundalini-

i am not clear about what is actually considered kundalini- is it just raising the energy at the base of the spine or does it include any chakra stimulating meditation-seems like obe inducing uses the chakras and stimulates the kundalini?

G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
Kundalini is a specific phenomenon, involving a snakelike movement of energy up through the body, 3.5 turns clockwise and then out through the head. This is an extremely physical, visceral sensation; often painful.  Chakra stimulation and activation and energy movement of any type can loosely be said to be kundalini related. But I dislike this term as it is confusing to relate too many things to a specific phenomenon.  This is like saying that flashlights, car batteries, electric lights, and all electrical devices, are all lightning related phenomena. This 'could' be said to be a true statement, but you must admit that this would cause great confusion if it were generally used.
<br>
<br>
At the time I first raised my kundalini, I had only read a couple of pages on kundalini, from some old spiritualist book.  But I've read a couple of books on this recently. One I would recommend is called "Kundalini: psychosis or transcendence".  I forget the author's name, re the book is out on loan at the moment. Its a very deep, informative book on the psychology of kundalini.
<br>
<br>
Where did I get my information...well, I worked most of it out for myself by doing and experiencing it for myself, and then thinking deeply on it.  Given the widespread misinformation and confusion surrounding kundalini today, I think this is probably the best way to come to grips with and make sense out of this phenomenon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

Thanks for your reply Robert.
<br>
So if chakra energy is related, can kundalini rise through chakra stimulation or do you have to try directly for kundalini?
<br>
Did you read Gopi Krishna's book- I think it was the standard kundalini book back in the eastern guru invasion?
<br>
Oh by the way- i vote for the astral navigation book next. Astral Dynamics is great for techniques but i would love to read about your actual travels in the astral, which would give us neophytes something to ponder.

G'day ralphm!
<br>
<br>
So if chakra energy is related, can kundalini rise through chakra stimulation or do you have to try directly for kundalini?
<br>
<br>
Kundalini is raised by stimulating the chakras, particularly the base chakra. One must stimulate all chakras, over and over, constantly returning to the base and raising lots of energy up the legs to the base.
<br>
<br>
Chakras are like leaky electronic capacitors, one has to fill a chakra with energy until it reaches critical mass and 'strobes'.  It is this strobe, in the base centre, that releases kundalini.  Sounds easy, but it can take several hours of intense effort to reach critical mass.
<br>
<br>
If the brow centre strobes, a brilliant minds eye flash of intense white light will be seen. This is as if a powerful camera flash has gone off in one's minds eyes.  It is accompanied by a feeling of mild concussion over the whole facial area.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Did you read Gopi Krishna's book- I think it was the standard kundalini book back in the eastern guru invasion?
<br>
<br>
No, I have not read it yet. I've only read a couple of books on kundalini, and these only recently.  I've skimmed through a few over the years, but did not find anything helpful. However, I plan to read as much as I can on kundalini over the next year or so, as part of my preparation for my planned book. This will be mainly to see what has been said so far, so I can give my opinion.
<br>
<br>
I skimmed through a book a few years ago by some author who's name escapes me at the moment, that recommended people to give their kundalini a pet name, eg, froggy, and to talk to it and coax it into life. I was quite shocked, as this is an absolutely ridiculous thing to suggest.
<br>
<br>
Oh by the way- i vote for the astral navigation book next. Astral Dynamics is great for techniques but i would love to read about your actual travels in the astral, which would give us neophytes something to ponder.
<br>
<br>
I'll keep this in mind.  I plan to do research for 'Astral Missions' at the same time as I do the hands on research for 'Kundalini Dynamics'. Raised kundalini may allow extremely powerful projections, probably will, but I have yet to try this out.  If it works, I can kill two birds with one stone.
<br>
<br>
I plan to journal my kundalini experiments, and will post them online.  I hope to begin this work around the end of this year.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

Hello Everybody!
<br>
I just registered on this forum and I must say, I am very very impressed. But then again I only have 19 short years of experience under my belt of what we call "living". So I imagine many things will impress me.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
I am very interested in learning trance, obe, and I guess Kundalini would be my main goal. It really does not frighten me, although I do have great respect for it. I guess my gut feeling tells me to trust and surrender and everything will be alright. Anyway, if I was really afraid of dying I wouldn't step into a car would I? No, dying is out of the question here, I hope to activate Kundalini in a gentle manner, although it really the sparks and fire really grab my attention and curiosity. We live to experience right?
<br>
Trance and meditation I suppose should be my first step. Robert, your discipline and long trance practices are really admirable. I would very much like to develop a discipline similar to that. Also I'm curious if you (or anyone else) would share a little about the water fasts mentioned above? Is it simply that you only drink water, or is it a bit more complicated than that?
<br>
Thank you very much everyone for creating such an interesting and comfortable place to learn and share information.
<br>
<br>
Have a great day!
<br>
Keith

G'day!
<br>
<br>
Water fasting is dealt with in my new book, Practical Psychic Self-Defense.
<br>
<br>
But, basically, for a water fast you only take water and vitamin pills for a set period of time, say 3 days. You need to drink lots of water.
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

Guess what? I've found an easier way to raise the Kundalini.  I tried all the hype methods and they don't work, but this seems like it should cause the guy describes the process, effects, etc. and they are all accurate. It works by tuning your brain into certain states. I have the program to do this, but need the information, and the info is in his manual (40$ US, $100,000,000 dollars canadian), and I simply can't afford it right now, as the Canadian currency is bad, and shipping and borders is murderous, etc. blah blah (and I am 'between jobs').  So, if anyone would like to buy it and send me the numbers, I can give out the file, and we might get somewhere. Here's the guys website:

ya know CP, many people have had bad kundalini awakenings using all natural means, so i think it would be a pretty bad idea to try using technology to help (since you can't completely appreciate or anticipate what could be happening as a side-effect(s)). just a caution. if you feel that you want to continue, that is your choice of course.

<section>
One of the traditional ways of raising kundalini is to have someone else do it for you. Specifically, someone who has gone through the experience. It is not easy to find someone who has gone through the experience who would still be willing to put someone through the experience who is not ready for it. It is hard for me to imagine a device of modern technology which could have an activate kundalini to trigger the experience in another person with. Are these light &amp; sound machines supposed to simulate it somehow?

I dont buy it
<br>
1. It reaks of just being a scam
<br>
2. The easiest way is not always the best way.
<br>
<br>
It seems if you have not prepared your own energy body and soul for Kundalini raising through a lot of meditative and energy work it either wont happen or you get bitten on the arse. If you are not ready then you will go insane and or die - assuming it works. Some do it early and not only live but learn to deal with it, but they write books about how hard it was and how stupid they were. .IMO if you are not ready then keep up the work until you are, even if it takes 15 years. Id rather have a nice consistantly growing energy body then a fantastic one in a mental ward or spirit relm.
<br>
<br>
I might sound like a conservative wet towel but it does not seem clever to raise it before you are ready.
<br>
<br>

The term for raising somebody elses kundalini is called "shaktipat". There is a school of kundalini yoga called Siddha Mahayoga which is exclusively devoted to this method, and it's very popular (because it's so easy). Many of the people who profess guru-status in this technique are frauds, but it is traditional and valid. Sri Ramakrishna gave shaktipat to Swami Vivekananda. If you want "quick realization" check out the FAQ at:
<br>

</a>
<br>
<br>
There is a list of groups/individuals at the bottom who give out shaktipat.
<br>
Read the rest of the Kundalini FAQ at that site before you do anything hasty.
<br>
Raising kundalini without a rock-solid spiritual foundation is foolhardy in the extreme. Gopi Krishna meditated obsessively for 17 years before his "spontaneous" awakening, and it wrecked him for years. There is a site called "Shared Transformations" that is all about kundalini horror stories from the people involved.

Tom and Fenris and others
<br>
<br>
your posts of warning are apt and correct.
<br>
<br>
I posted a story on another thread somewhere here about a lady who visited her kundalini guru in India for enlightenment. He told her that she was ready for kundalini awakening and that the master 'awaken' her himself. Well, she was devastated and shamed by it all, she had the biggest orgasm ever, in front of all the other devotees.
<br>
<br>
I don't know how the guru did it, but kundalini is the harnessing and the explosion of sexual energy, ching chi, so if you want it it is there waiting for you, but getting someone else to do it for you is crazy stuff.
<br>
<br>
And to pay for an instrument that emitts electromagnetic radiation, like what this machine sounds like it does, is even crazier. Go back to basics, work at it in meditation and breathing chi, and you will make it. Don't forget, God doesn't give guns to children, you have to earn the right to awaken kundalini.

<section>
I'm sort of in shock, I heard Robert Bruce tonight on the Art Bell show.  I was only half listening to the show- I'm not very interested in psychic attack.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I realized that I was hearing someone describing, the same experience I had over 30 years ago;  Robert Bruce, almost exacty as I had experienced it, was describing raising the Kundilini.
<br>
<br>
I'd never had my experience validated until now.  I'm profoundly grateful and confused as well.  You see, until now, I wasn't sure that my experince wasn't unique to me.  I did find out about the Kundilini after my experience, but never in detail.
<br>
<br>
I'll write more about this more later, but briefly:
<br>
<br>
When I was about 18 I fasted for about 2 weeks, eating just some brown rice and black tea each day.
<br>
<br>
I studied the Tibetan Book of the Dead and other spiritual information which I had available.
<br>
<br>
On the day when I was ready I didn't eat anything and  took 1225 micrograms of LSD.  For those of you who don't know that is about 1025 micrograms more than is considered a dose which is necessary for mystical experience.
<br>
<br>
I had a big one.  Robert Bruce described it tonight.  The main difference between his experience and mine was that I met only two beings, and that at the time, interpertated them to be, Christ and the Buddha.  The beings I saw were much different than Mr. Bruce described. However hey did not introduce themselves.  They just looked at me with surprise like how did you get here?
<br>
<br>
Another diffence, the snake I saw and experience was MUCH bigger.  At least when looking at it.
<br>
<br>
One of the interesting things about my experience is that I had never read or heard of the Kundilini, until after the experience.  After the experience, I did a lot of reading and did then become aware of, "raising the Kundilini' and the serpent power.
<br>
<br>
However, until tonight, upon hearing Mr. Bruce and reading these postings I have never had my experience validated so profoundly, or with such detail.  Although, I've always known that the experience made me different than most other people, I thought that I had an exaturated memory of the experience because of the LSD.
<br>
<br>
In a way the experience has made me almost insane at times in my life.  That's because since then I see life so much differently than most other people.  I just don't understand their values or fear of death.  I don't understand why most people dis-believe in reincarnation.  I don't understand how much ignorance and brutality the majority of people find acceptable.
<br>
<br>
I haven't read here or anywhere of people having spontanious rasing of the Kundilini by using psychedelics.  Are there more of us out there?
<br>
<br>
Though I do not regret the experience it sure had caused me much pain and confusion, in this life.  Is there anyone out there who can give me some advise or help with this?
<br>
<br>
Hearing Robert Bruce tonight makes me more confused.  Now I know that I had a valid spiritual experience, not just a drug one.  Yet, I've felt so abandanded by what I've always felt should be my spiritual protectors and advisors since then.  I felt at that time my acceptance of this vaster spiritual reality should have provided me with help and guidance.  Seemingly, I've had none.  What's up with that?
<br>
<br>
I'm really open to suggestion on this, at least on this forum.
<br>
<br>

Robert,
<br>
I believe that the book you are refering to: Kundalini: Psychosis or Trancendence is by Lee Sanella M.D. with parts by Itzchak Bentov. I'll dig up my copy and get the ISBN.
<br>
BTW, throughly enjoyed hearing you on Art Bell!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;At the time I first raised my kundalini, I had only read a couple of pages on kundalini, &gt;from some old spiritualist book. But I've read a couple of books on this recently. One &gt;I would recommend is called "Kundalini: psychosis or transcendence". I forget the &gt;author's name, re the book is out on loan at the moment. Its a very deep, informative &gt;book on the psychology of kundalini.

<section>
G'day foks!
<br>
<br>
Brad, could you please post a detailed description here of your kundalini experience?
<br>
<br>
I noticed some people are saying that the serpent of fire involved with kundalini is merely a symbol.  I disagree with this because my experience proves to me that this is the actual physical sensation that kundalini causes when it raises through its primary pathway. I have done this many times, and it always comes with the basic serpent-like internal sensation.
<br>
<br>
Raising kundalini, deliberately or spontaneously, is about the most awesome experience anyone could have.  If you live through it and manage to stay sane, one would expect some form of guidance or direction from the powers above.  But this does not generally happen, and you are left alone to make your own way in life, life or die, sane or insane.  Kundalini changes you and opens you up to perceptions and forces of the greater reality.  But k needs to be developed and stabilized just like any other ability. It is NOT a raise once and its done kind of thing, where you suddenly become fully enlightened and have angels and spirit guidance at your beck and call.  Life is not like this, and those who believe otherwise have a lot to learn and a long way to go.
<br>
<br>
Raising kundalini opens you up to the greater reality and greatly increases your potential.  But you need to develop it and learn how to raise kundalini regularly so it can be developed and stabilized and evolved.  I suppose its a bit like learning how to wake induce an OBE.  After you succeed at your first wake induced exit, there is still much to do and learn before one could say one has full OBE ability.  One has the potential for this, but not much else at that stage.
<br>
<br>
One of the biggest problems I see is that if a person raises kundalini but has not done, or does not undertake,  the inner work to purify his/her foundation belief systems, even though they are open to the greater reality, they have self imposed blinkers that prohibit further real spiritual development.  This causes many internal conflicts and can make life very difficult indeed until this is rectified.
<br>
<br>
For example, lets say Jack raises his kundalini once, but continues to hold to many partisan beliefs that are flawed (See my website article 'The Catch Basket Concept'). This sets up a conflict between his personal beliefs and the actual truth of the greater reality.  Because of this, Jack's spiritual progression is stopped cold, and life becomes difficult because Jack is, basically, in denial.  Jack wants the truth, but refuses to see it, so stumbles blindly.  This conflict can also open Jack to negative energies and beings that thrive on lies and deceit and conflict.
<br>
<br>
My suggestion to anyone in this position is that they first work on their beliefs, and purify and simplify them according to their own personal proof. This sounds easy but its not.  Keep everything you have experienced for yourself, but only in its most basic form. For example, you may have seen or experienced a spirit, a deity, or an angel, or even a demon or ghost.  This proves to you that such beings exist, but it does not prove anything else beyond this.  You may have given or experienced spiritual healing, but this does not prove that their are spirit guides or etc hovering nearby and assisting or enabling this.  It just proves that spiritual healing is possible and true.  Assumption is the destroyer of truth.
<br>
<br>
By way of example:  you mention a belief in reincarnation, but I doubt that you have very much by way of personal proof to back this up.  A little synchronicity, plus a few feelings and fragments of memories, and dreams of same, and reading a few suggestive stories of people remember past lives and providing a few details that check out, really proves nothing.  But the average seeker is swamped with flaky information and stories, and the beliefs of others, reinforcing linear reincarnation, and the belief that everyone has a say, a choice, as to how and when they reincarnate.  The consequence of this is that if one holds onto the popular linear reincarnational theory, one blocks out fundamental aspects of the greater reality, because it is generally non linear.  (See my online article 'Reincarnation, Not So Simple')
<br>
<br>
*Please note that I will not enter into a debate on reincarnation here.
<br>
<br>
Balance and truth are necessary to stabilize and develop kundalini in the long term.  The intellect, plus intuition and everything else need to be developed in a balanced way.  Balance breeds stability and power and progression. This is a universal truth.
<br>
<br>
Brad, you also mention that you feel abandoned by your spiritual protectors and advisors.  What if spirit guides and protectors are not given by default to everyone at birth?  Can you imagine the belief system conflict and misery that this could cause if you held onto this belief too tightly, but it was not actually true? In my experience, contact with advanced spirit beings is extremely rare, and by large is enigmatic in the extreme when it does occur.
<br>
<br>
Have you ever wondered why there are no realized Western masters who follow and adhere to popular newage Western spiritual beliefs?  Some people claim this, but close examination reveals they have feet of clay and or are merely legends in their own minds. But there seem to be a number of realized Eastern masters, who generally adhere to very strict beliefs, disciplines and practices.  Why is this so?
<br>
<br>
I think the main problem here is twofold:   Eastern beliefs and practices do not translate well.  Also, the higher levels of these are pretty much kept secret and only passed on by word of mouth, from master to student, as necessary.  Added to this we have the Western way of taking the interesting bits and pieces that make sense to us, and grafting this onto our existing beliefs, eg, Christianity and etc. The end result is a poor mish mash of conflicting beliefs and practices that does not contain enough truth to promote the necessary balance that is needed for higher spiritual development.
<br>
<br>
In closing, if someone has raised kundali once, they can do it again with far less effort and or discomfort.  But this will still take much time, as the required state takes quite a long time to get into.  A minimum of a couple of hours full trance meditation, plus energy work, is required for repeat development work. Note that early k raising attempts usually require several hours of full trance work and E work.
<br>
<br>
Anway, I fear I have reached new heights in waffling......
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.
<br>
<br>
ps, JohnY-- thanks for the reference help!

Robert,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the replyl.
<br>
<br>
I will describe my experience in detail and at length in the near future.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, the experience was as physical as it can get.  I thought my back was going to break because of the energy which came up through me.  Which was part of why I accepted my death and threw myself to the mercy of what created us.
<br>
<br>
Then the experience became as metaphysical as it can get.
<br>
<br>
It may be that people experience this at different levels.
<br>
<br>
I have lived a very intense life and all I can say is that experience was as intense physicially as it gets.  Metaphysicially as well.
<br>
<br>
I have much more to say on this.
<br>
<br>
I hava much more to ask.
<br>

Thank you so much for your response.

<section>
Robert,
<br>
<br>
A few more quick thoughts.
<br>
<br>
I will elaborate and fill in the details of my experience later in the week.
<br>
<br>
As synchronicity has had it I was composing a note to someone else regarding all this when I heard you on the Art Bell show.
<br>
<br>
Though I may have to reedit that note for this forum it will have a clear description of my Kundellini experience.
<br>
<br>
My description may be a bit longer than most of the posts I've had a chance to skim on this forum.  Will that be a problem?
<br>
<br>
But for now, I will say that I've always though that the experience has changed me at the molecular level. I felt as if the experience was an initiation in the classical way.  I felt as if I was turned inside out - if that means anything to you.
<br>
<br>
You have no idea how glad I am to finially find someone who has had a similar experience. (or perhaps you do).  But in my experience, though I've known some fairly open minded folks I've never experience anybody I've run into who has been able to accept my experience, except in a symbolic way.
<br>
<br>
The experience was not symbolic at all to me although it involved symbols.  It involved physiciality in a way that I don't want to experience again.  However, touching the metaphysical planes so consiously again would be my happiest moment.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again,
<br>
<br>
Brad

<section>
Robert Bruce,
<br>
<br>
Your posts on K are absolutely fascinating.  I have some questions, if you get a moment to reply I would really appreciate it.
<br>
<br>
1.  What is the "Auum effect"?
<br>
<br>
2.  And what exactly is the "full Medusa effect"?  I get an impression of a very bad hair day indeed!
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "Kundalini can raise in 5 well known ways, with its highest path being the serpent of fire path.  K's primary pathway involves the serpent of fire. This feels like a real physical snake the size of a man's wrist is forcing its way up through your body (starting at the perrineum), 3.5 coils through your body and then up through your neck and head. This is a 'very' noticeable sensation. You will feel your organs and intestines being moved (sloshing about) as this happens, as they are moved out of the way."
</i>
<br>
<br>
3.  What are the "5 well known ways"?  Is it possible to experience Kundalini without the "serpent of fire"?
<br>
<br>
4.  I have read that Kundalini can rise as a result of personal trauma, or an NDE.  Would you say this was true?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "Kundalini can be very painful and burning in the early stages. This gets easier to handle and less painful each time you do it. This is possible only if you do not lose your mind through poor preparation.  The moment kundalini rises, your body will experience full physical shock. Your bowels will let go, re the need for cleansing practices like fasting and enemas to avoid this."
</i>
<br>
<br>
5.  With hindsight, what "preparation" could you have done to make your experience easier?
<br>
<br>
6.  You say you "should have died" but did not.  What happened to your body at this time?  Can you describe the experience, did your heart stop beating?
<br>
<br>
7.  And how long did it take for your body to recover from the Serpent of Fire experience?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "Another side effect of raised kundalini was greatly enhanced empathy, intuition and psychic abilities. At this level these are quite troublesome and disturbing. After raising kundalini a dozen or so times, I took a year off from everything, to give my mind and senses time to adapt. If I had not done so I would have gone mad."
</i>
<br>
<br>
8.  Can you give an example of the side effects that you found difficult to deal with?
<br>
<br>
9.  What psychic abilities developed as a result of your awakening?
<br>
<br>
10.  What are the benefits of raising Kundalini?  What is it for?
<br>
<br>

R[maroon][/maroonRobert,
<br>
<br>
Though I too am not interested in an arguement on reincarnation, I do want to point out the following:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Their is beginning to be abundent proof of reincarnation.  Though I will provide more info in the future, for now I suggest the book, "Old Souls", I don't remember the name of the author.  It is about the work of Dr. Ian Stevens a psychiatrist who devoted his entire career (38 years) to documenting people with provable memories of past lives.
<br>
<br>
Though during the kundilini experience which began this disscussion I did experience that all time is in really NOW, paradoxicially I still think that their is something to linear reincarnation.  This may be a sort of illusion I don't know.
<br>
<br>
I don't claim that I met deities in my kundillini experience.  The beings I observed did not have name tags and no voice boomed out introducing them and they did not shake my hand and say that I'm....  I have no idea of who they were.  I'll only say that at the time they seemed to me too be like Christ and the Buddah.  I will say that I think they were beings far advanced from me.  That they were on the side of the creator and beings of much power, insight and wisdom.
<br>
<br>
You asked, " But there seem to be a number of realized Eastern masters, who generally adhere to very strict beliefs, disciplines and practices. Why is this so?
<br>
<br>
I can't answer that question.  I will offer some opinions.  Could one answer be the regitity of orthodoxy?
<br>
<br>
I think that the work of Michael Newton, Ph.D. a hypnotherapist who has written, "Journey of Souls" and "Destiny of Souls" and many other hypnotherapists and near death researchers and channels clearly prove that we do choose our parents, lessons and circumstances of our incarnations.
<br>
<br>
Though I long studied the Qabalh and many other occoult and mystical systems I stopped for the stuffiness, regity, self rightousness and self importance, I found tainting many of those teachings.  In spite of the fact that I know that many truths can be found in these systems, I wanted information from the source, if you will.  Or at least as close to the source as I can find.  That would be souls who have either been to the other side or were there.
<br>
<br>
For those reasons I've focused my attention on information from near death experiencers, hypnotic regression, and some channeling information (Seth and Michael, FYI), rather than the, "Masters" who adhere to very strict beliefs and practices.  Though I do strongly believe that some of these "masters" do have knowledge of these matters I'm really tired with the pomposity, regitity, and self importance many of these folks often display and offer as "fact".
<br>

<br>
Robert,
<br>
<br>
A couple of thoughts.  I have been going over my memories of my Kundilini experience, in preparation to writing as an exact memory I can, 30 years later, both for you and my friend Natabara Das, consequentially I've been regaining some related memories long forgotten.
<br>
<br>
One thing which I had put into the backroom of my memories, which I've recently recalled, was something which I thought you might find interesting, particularly since you are an expert on psychic attacks and self defense of such.
<br>
<br>
The day after I had my Kundilini experience, someone I'd never met came to the house where I was living and sought me out.  Later I found out that his explanation of why he showed up there was, at best, suspect.
<br>
<br>
I lived in a large apt, sort of a commune, which was popular back then.  I mention this because no one in this apt. knew this person, who came looking for me, as I later found out.
<br>
<br>
The man who sought me out made no secret to me that he was a black magician.  In fact he tried to recruit me into his group.  After meeting him twice and making it very clear to him that I had absolutely no interest in his proposals I never saw him again.
<br>
<br>
I've always wondered if something about my kundilini experience attracted him to me.  Actually, I don't see any other explanation. And in a way this experience has always confirmed to me that I was on the positive side of things and that the experience was valid.
<br>
<br>
But some of the information the black magician discussed with me brought to my attention and got me to study a writer you should know well, Dionne Fortune, the Qabilist author of Psychic Self Defense and other books on the Qabalh.  This meeting was what got me interested in the Qabalah and related occult studies.
<br>
<br>
Next, though I mentioned that I'd given up studying traditional masters, teaching and the like, for less stuffy, orthodox and dogmatic teachings to look into near death, hypnotherapy etc.  I have learned much from these studies.  But I will admit that I haven't seen a word regarding kundilini and some of the matters which those whom I've described as "dogmatic, rigid, stuffy, self important.
<br>
<br>
It is clear to me that there is a paradoxical reality going on here (at least with me) which I do not understand. There seems to be some validly to some of those stuffy old dogmatic masters and some of the so called "new age" philosophers as well.
<br>
<br>
Just my limited opinion.
<br>
<br>

G'day Tia!
<br>
<br>
1.  What is the "Auum effect"?
<br>
<br>
2.  And what exactly is the "full Medusa effect"?  I get an impression of a very bad hair day indeed!
<br>
<br>
When kundalini has been raised to its full a number of times, and the energy body has settled down and adapted, the kundalini state begins to develop and deepen.  When fully raised in its more developed state, kundalini raises in the normal way, with a visceral snakelike sensation, 3.5 coils up through the body.  When it reaches the head, it feels like the top of the head disappears and hundreds of soft, fat, fleshy antennae sprout from the surface of the brain, each feeling about the size of a finger.  These move and form geometric patterns, depending on the subject of your thoughts. If you change a thought, or think of a person, they change pattern and point to where a living person is in real time, geographically. At this time, the brow and crown centres seem to fuse, and the brow is felt as a hand sized fleshy flap hanging down over the brow, connected to the crown structure. When all this happens, the sacred Aummm is felt and heard, quite strongly and loudly, as permeating all reality inside and out. This sounds/feels like the Aummm word being vibrated in the back of a mature man's throat, deep and powerful.
<br>
<br>
3.  What are the "5 well known ways"?  Is it possible to experience Kundalini without the "serpent of fire"?
<br>
<br>
I have read that there are 5 pathways, in yoga, tantra and other esoteric texts, but do not have the books to hand at present. The serpent of fire pathway is the primary kundalini pathway.  The lesser pathways are said to result from energy blockages.  I only raise kundalini in one way, so have no personal experience with the lesser pathways.
<br>
<br>
4.  I have read that Kundalini can rise as a result of personal trauma, or an NDE.  Would you say this was true?
<br>
<br>
I can't see kundalini resulting from personal trauma, but maybe death or near death would cause a strong kundalini related surge.
<br>
<br>
5.  With hindsight, what "preparation" could you have done to make your experience easier?
<br>
<br>
I would have spent a lot more time preparing and purifying myself.  I would also have spent more time stimulating my intellect to promote more balance.
<br>
<br>
6.  You say you "should have died" but did not.  What happened to your body at this time?  Can you describe the experience, did your heart stop beating?
<br>
<br>
I think my heart stopped beating for a couple of minutes. I was ejected from my body in a very powerful OBE, much like a NDE.
<br>
<br>
7.  And how long did it take for your body to recover from the Serpent of Fire experience?
<br>
<br>
Physically, I recovered in a couple of hours, especially after a swim and some food and exercise.  Mentally I was also fine, apart from the onslaught of psychic impressions and creative ideas.
<br>
<br>
8.  Can you give an example of the side effects that you found difficult to deal with?
<br>
<br>
The pressure of the psychic and emotional impressions I sensed coming from all around me.  This also opened me up to very strong psychic attacks. Keep in mind that the reason I raised kundalini was to find a way to stop the attacks on my home and family.  Kundalini made matters much worse, but I learned a lot in the process.
<br>
<br>
9.  What psychic abilities developed as a result of your awakening?
<br>
<br>
All of them, some stronger and some weaker.  Another big change kundalini brings is heightened creativity and intellectual ability.
<br>
<br>
10.  What are the benefits of raising Kundalini?  What is it for?
<br>
<br>
Emancipation is always the primary reason, meaning one can escape the incarnational process.  Spiritual evolution and evolving to a higher stage of spiritual existence is also high on the list.
<br>
<br>
I think one of the biggest problem people encounter stems from the sheer lack of knowedge about kundalini and what it is. Most people believe it is a raise once and its done kind of thing, and a huge range of symptoms are said to indicate raised kundalini.  But I think that unless one experiences some primary kundalini raising sensations, one is only experiencing kundalini related phenomena.
<br>
<br>
Most problems I have encountered, and heard about from others, can be overcome by repeatedly raising and developing kundalini, and by using the new potential it creates, eg, especially involving creative and intellectual pursuits.  Kundalini, once raised, needs to be used and exercised and developed. If not, a host of conflicts arise, along with various levels of instability.
<br>
<br>
Note, I advise anyone who raises their kundalini deliberately, to repeat this a few times, a week apart, and then take a year off all energy work and concentrate on grounding yourself by focusing on your physical life. This is also a good time to focus on stimulating and exercise the intellect, by learning and reading, or by doing something creative, eg, artwork, playing musical instruments, writing, poetry, etc. The creative and intellectual aspects need stimulating after kundalini has been raised.
<br>
<br>
For those who experience a spontaneous kundalini rising, I suggest they take also take a year off and do the above.  After this, they should learn how to raise their kundalini deliberately if they want to develop kundalini.  If not, following a creative path, music or art or etc, will ease most kundalini related problems.
<br>
<br>
Dietary needs and alergies or sensitivity to certain foods is quite normal after kundalini has been raised. A healthy diet, avoiding things you are sensitive to, is the best way to deal with this.
<br>
<br>
Regular daily trance meditation is always adviced when kundalini has become active or has been raised.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

Many thanks Robert for taking the time here.  I did want to know what your motive was in raising Kundalini which you have answered, fascinating as I would have thought it would have given you more knowledge and power to deal with things of a phsycic nature.  I guess I still dont quite understand it.  Isn't Kundalini a form of energy, and cant you use that energy?
<br>
<br>
I did read Gopi Krishna some time ago and if I remember correctly he also mentioned feeling as though his internal organs were being moved about.  He also lived in a part of the world (India I think) where Kundalini was not unheard of but could find no one/guru  to advise or help him, or even to say if infact he was experiencing a Kundalini awakening so I was left with the impression that it's not just the western world that is uninformed.
<br>
<br>
You dont mention at all the Kundalini travelling up the spine which I have read about.  Is this perhaps one of the 5 'other' pathways you talked about?  Or just phenomena?  And does Kundalini phenomena lead to a Kundalini awakening?
<br>
<br>
With regard to NEW, didn't it prepare you in some way, having strengthened your energy body?
<br>
<br>
I didn't mean to ask more questions but I guess the more you tell me, the more I will want to know - should I just wait for you to write the book?

<section>
Robert,
<br>
<br>
As you requested, here is my description of my Kundilini experience.
<br>
<br>
When I was about 18 or 19 after a few previous psychedelic experiences and some reading of spiritual matters, I decided to use a large dose of LSD to attempt a full blown mystical experience.  I was very interested in experiencing what created us then as directly as possible (how simplistic most of us are at that age).
<br>
<br>
As this was in San Francisco, during what has become known as, "the Summer of Love" I had access to both real LSD and a wide diversity of spiritual thought.
<br>
<br>
Though I was then, already a vegetarian, I prepared for the experience by fasting for two weeks, eating just a bit of brown rice and black tea each day. I did breathing exercises and meditation and spiritual reading and contemplation during those weeks.
<br>
<br>
On the appointed day, I didn't eat anything.  That night, when everybody else in the house was asleep I put 1225 mcg of LSD 25 under my tongue.
<br>
<br>
I began with some breathing exercises.
<br>
<br>
Then I began a meditation, based on an article I'd been studying in preparation for the experience.
<br>
<br>
The meditation was to hear and focus on the highest frequency I could hear in the inner ear in my head.  Then to completely focus on the sound as it got louder and then higher in frequency.
<br>
<br>
It actually happened, the sound got louder and higher, in jumps, each more intense.  This seemed to cause a sort of a "critical mass" situation.  Each jump had the power to initiate the next jump in power is the only way I can describe it.
<br>
<br>
After a short while the effect was unstoppable, the sound got much louder and higher.  In other words, it was as if a critical frequency was reached and it caused both the increase in sound loudness and frequency which seemed to be unstoppable.
<br>
<br>
I felt as if my brain was going to explode.  This all began to happen after about 10+ min after ingestion of the LSD, or so it seemed.
<br>
<br>
Then I knew that I was going to die.
<br>
<br>
I staggered into the next room to tell one of my roommates that I was going to die.
<br>
<br>
Patronizingly, she told me to go back to my trip and that I was just having a hallucination.
<br>
<br>
Somehow, in spite of the terror, the studying and preparation I'd been doing kept reminding me of the experience which I had been preparing myself for, so I didn't panic.
<br>
<br>
I returned to my room and retook the meditation posture, which I had been in here-to-for, and decided to accept my fate.
<br>
<br>
If I was going to die, I accepted that.  I put myself into the hands of our creator.  After all, wasn't the whole reason I'd initiated the experience?
<br>
<br>
When I next opened my eyes, what a "hallucination", I "saw".  Everything that I was looking at in my room was really a huge snake.
<br>
<br>
When I say huge, everything within my view, which was not me, was the snake.  The snake was exquisitely beautiful and seemed to be of the constrictor type.  There was no question that the snake entirely dominated the situation.  I was totally at its mercy.
<br>
<br>
Then the snake put its huge face, right up against my little nose.  Face to face.  Nose to nose.
<br>
<br>
Part of what happened next, was what validated what you were saying as being truthful, to me, was what you said on the Art Bell show, because I'd long suppressed the memory.
<br>
<br>
It just seemed that this memory was so Freudian, and consequentially seemingly discrediting of my story, that I had never told anyone this part of the experience.  Because next the snake seemed to have its snout between my legs and was tapping or pounding me there.  It was like a reptilian rape.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, it seemed like the snout of the snake broke threw something and was going up into my body.
<br>
<br>
I felt then as if something molecular happened to me and that the serpent had an atomic way into me which I could not stop. I remember gasping for breath at this, as it filled me up.
<br>
<br>
Then I went into convulsions, but just in my upper body as so much power surged up through my back.
<br>
<br>
I'd been sitting on a couch, in a meditation posture and I felt my back just arching in a way that I thought was going to just snap my spine.  The convulsions were just uncontrollable, unrelenting and gruesome.  I felt as if I were a rabbit in the jaws of a large dog.
<br>
<br>
If you have ever had what we in the U.S. call the, "dry heaves" you may know what I'm talking about.  For those of you unfamiliar with this slang, "dry heaves" means to puke, or throw up, with nothing in you stomach. It's just unrelenting and unstoppable. But what I experienced was more powerful than that.
<br>
<br>
I've often told those to whom I have related this story, is that the experience felt as if someone had put opposing poles of extremely high powered electrodes at the base of my spine and top of my head.
<br>
<br>
Then something else happened, and I felt as if my brain and mind became light.  At that point my experience was joy and ecstasy.
<br>
<br>
Next, I found myself in an exalted room where there were two beings which I interperated as being like the Christ and Buddha.  I am not claiming that is who the beings were.  I will say that the beings seemed to be quite exalted and wise.  They seemed to be surprised by my appearance.  I do remember looking into the eye of the Buddaic being and seeing into his mind. I remember light bright clear white light.
<br>
<br>
At this point much of the detail becomes vague.  But I felt as if I was taken by a third being and shown many of the deeper secrets of creation.  Later I read of some of these things in Vedic literature.
<br>
<br>
FYI I have taken many other psychedelic voyages since then (though none for about 15 years), some of then also extremely large doses (12 gr. Of psilocybin mushrooms for example).  Though I have had many deep spiritual experiences I have never had an experience which was similar.  I certainly have not had the physical experience of the convulsions  and the back arching which I did during my Kundilini experience.
<br>
<br>
Other than that I can only say that the experience was the most powerful, important and pivital of this life.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I've felt as if I stumbled into this experience before I was spiritually ready for it.  But then on the other hand part of me says you cannot have this experience until you are ready.  I just don't know.
<br>
<br>

Robert, the questions keep coming-why should a person not do any meditation for a year after? not even mindfulness meditations? Is it because it will start kundalini again? The most intense meditative experience I had was reinitiated by listening to music, if kundalini could be restarted spontaniously I suppose one could not even listen to music for a year afterward.
<br>
Is there a certain thing that happens right before kundalini rises that is different from other energy sensations?

Hello Robert!
<br>
Just some questions ive had on my mind.
<br>
<br>
1.The ectoplasm you mentioned.This is what actually moves your organs aside?Has there been any proof of that?Like say an autopsy?
<br>
<br>
2.How do you know when you are ready to raise your kundalini?Can it just raise on its own eventually?If you get far enough along on your spiritual path?
<br>
<br>
3.I raise energy often.Using new energy ways,Thanks to you making it so easy.I like to go on for hours sometimes.I worry that I may be over doing it.And I might activate the

<section>
G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
First, I would like to make it clear that I am not intentionally wagging my finger at anyone and saying they are wrong, or that I am right.  I do not go against public opinion just for the sake of it.  I just answer to the best of my ability, as honestly as I can, based on personal experience and deep thinking. I can do no more or less than that.
<br>
<br>
Now I'll try to answer a couple of recent questions in this topic..
<br>
<br>
1. Tia:  I too thought I could use kundalini energy to help others, and myself, but it did not work out this way.  And developing kundalini and learning how to use its energy is not really feasible while one is possessed by an arch demon.  Once kundalini has been raised, the energy body and psychic abilities, and the mind, are quite unstable and exposed to an onslaught of impressions.  To use energy effectively, one must have focus and balance.  This is, basically, why it puts you in a difficult situation rather than solving problems.
<br>
<br>
I did not develop the NEW system until a few years after I first raised my kundalini. But NEW certainly makes the energy raising and chakra manipulation much easier.
<br>
<br>
Prior to early kundalini raising, massive kundalini spikes are felt coursing up through the spine.  This will happen the first few times its raised, getting progressively easier each time.  Then it stops happening and only the serpent sensation is felt.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini related phenomena does not necessarily lead to a full kundalini raising.  A fair number of people experience this kind of phenomena, but actually raising kundalini is far more rare.  Taming and developing kundalini is even more rare, almost unheard of apparently.
<br>
<br>
2. Brad:  Thanks for the extra info. You definitely seem to have experienced some kind of spontaneous kundalini raising, but I don't really know what this would have done to your energy body.  This was obviously triggered by LSD, so you obviously have potential.  But whether or not you can repeat this and or develop it would depend on the time and effort you put into it.
<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that how you are on the inside, your thoughts and motivatons, are also extremely important.  Long term spiritual discipline helps a great deal to prepare for kundalini.
<br>
<br>
3. Ralphm:  After a full kundalini raising, it is necessary to thoroughly ground the body and mind firmly in the physical.  This is necessary if one hopes to handle the onslaught of psychic impressions and ideas, and the surging of the energy body, which becomes extremely sensitive.  The minds eye, for example, fills with images and the mind with impressions.  This is not a comfortable way to live and it would be easy to tip over the edge and become deluded, or insane.
<br>
<br>
Certain types of music will stimulate the energy body and psychic senses, but this will not trigger a kundalini rising, even after its been done once or twice.
<br>
<br>
Kundalini rising is vastly different from any other energy sensation or phenomena.  Its like comparing mains voltage with a flashlight battery. Most people I have come across have difficulty conceiving of what kundalini is actually like, and generally fall back on partisan opinion, that tends to greatly downgrade kundalini into a fairly common phenomenon. Kundalini is not common at all.  It is the ultimate expression and evolution of the human energy body.
<br>
<br>
I heard one author (who shall be nameless) suggest to readers that they give their kundalini a pet name and talk to it, to coax it into activity.  This really made me curl up laughing. The author obviously had no idea as to the true nature of kundalini.
<br>
<br>
4. Alpha:  My theory that the internal sensations of kundalini would be very difficult to prove either way.  They are based on observaton and logic. I can think of nothing else but a strong internal production of ectoplasm that could cause such viseral sensations and internal physical movement.  An autopsy would prove nothing, as would opening me up during a kundalini raising session.  Ectoplasm is destroyed by light.  And I am destroyed by the thought of someone taking a knife to my stomach during such a profound moment:)
<br>
<br>
As for when one is ready to raise kundalini, well, I would expect some significant advancement both spiritually and metaphysically, eg, the ability to have wake induced OBE's would be a good indicator.  OBE is much, much easier than kundalini, so if one fails at 'wake inducing' OBE one is obviously not ready. Some level of visual clairvoyance, plus other psychic abilities such as healing and etc would also be expected.
<br>
<br>
Note that kundalini has both a positive and negative side. If one succeeds at raising kundalini before one is ready, the going would get really rough.
<br>
<br>
I do not think that doing normal energy work, NEW or primary levels, could not trigger a full kundalini raising.  A great deal of time and effort is necessary to do this, so I don't think it could be done accidentally.  However, any type or level of energy work could trigger spontaneous kundalini related symptoms.
<br>
But I don't think a full kundalini rising would result from this, not with the full serpent phenomenon and etc.
<br>
<br>
All the above, however, depends on how you conceive kundalini to be.  I met a woman recently, and kundalini was mentioned, and she said 'I've done that'. A little questioning revealed that she had had a vision of a snake during a meditation, and some itchy sensations up her legs.  Because of this, she was convinced she had done it and was now enlightened.  Go figure it...
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

  Prior to early kundalini raising, massive kundalini spikes are felt coursing up through the spine. This will happen the first few times its raised, getting progressively easier each time. Then it stops happening and only the serpent sensation is felt.

Robert,
<br>
<br>
The sensation I get is like there is a big pulse in my brain. Then there is a BIG rush of energy down my spine which causes what feels like *very* powerful contraction (and subsequent release) of my whole lower spinal region.
<br>
<br>
Then there is an immediate and powerful rush of energy from my lower spinal region back to my head. Followed by another great pulsing in my brain and the cycle will repeat.
<br>
<br>
The feelings are
<i>
 extremely powerful
</i>
to the extent where I can only stand about 4 or 5 cycles before feeling giddy and a bit sick and I'm struggling to try and make them stop. This happens to me about once a month, on average, and I always wondered what they were.
<br>
<br>
I wondered if they are what you are calling "Kundalini spikes?"
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

This the same sensation we talked about on the "Soul Spasms" thread? I'd be really interesting in Robert's take of them.

I would like to query Roberts statement that the ability to have awake induced OBE and other psychic abilities could or would be expected before you were ready to raise your kundalini.Maybe its a matter of which comes first the chicken or the egg.But to my way of thinking Kundalini gives you unlimited energy which would then manifest these abilities.Of course mental emotional spiritual and even physical balance are desirable and maybe there's even some sort of shorting system in place  till this takes place.
<br>
In my postings more about the kundalini I wrote of the possibility that Roberts new energy inducing system could activate the sleeping snake ,after a little thought I wonder if his system mirrors this event in some minor way.

Sorry folks I'm carrying on a bit of a debate all by myself here,this being my third posting on this subject in 24 hours.
<br>
As I walked with my dog this morning ,I gave the mater some thought ,amd came to the conclusion that Kundalini activating physic abilities could not be the whole storyr.This does not allow for the fact that varying gifts are scattered threw out the populace.A answer may be that kundalini can be partially active ,this would account for the variation from person to person.

After much reading on various sites &amp; books, I realize that I definately havn't had a Kundalini rising experience, maybe some Kundalini spikes as mentioned before or soul spasms, as I have a few things to experience yet &amp; some problems to overcome first. Also the condition my spine is in, I'd probably end up back in hospital.
<br>
<br>
Robert, if you happen to read this could you let me know your opinion on whether a damaged spine would make Kundalini rising less or more possible?
<br>
Or is it completely unrelated? I've posted this question twice before, but you must have missed it.

<br>
in response to your comments I think Robert is saying that raising kundalini has side effects that need to be considered. I have had these experiences for over 20 years and sometimes, when I am not fully grounded emotionally myself, I fear having my kundalini awakened.
<br>
<br>
The side effects are emotional / physical and include panic attacks, anxiety, heart palpitations, dizzyness, confusion, sleeplessness, the works. So it is just not safe to go out and 'do it' without first preparing the foundations first. Good luck.

<section>
With all this kundalini discussion, I feel it time to share the wisdom of my guru (see the post on brainwave altering devices for information on my guru).
<br>
<br>
He has some great ideas about how to raise energy.  Kundalini is one of his favorites he often gets mystical experiences after raising the Kundalini.
<br>
<br>
Ok, lets get to the point.  If your new with kundalini you should start with low energy.  Grab a light serpent (10kg for example), fully mummify it so its quite rigid.   Then you want to grab a couple more animals.  Keep them alive becuause you want to raise the energy.  Tame animal spirits will raise easier.  Gouge the snake into the animals so you have a kundalini vibrating at your desired rate (diff animals for diff vibrations and effects).  Put the complete appartus at your feet in front of you, the snake perpendicular to your lower leg bones.  Ok lets have a look at this metaphysically, you will be raising the kundalini from below your Base Chakra to above your Crown, passing the Pubic Chakra, Abdominal Chakra, Pecs Chakra, Trapz Chakra then the Gym Chakra then UP UP N AWAY.
<br>
<t>
 .
 <br>
 So just clear your mind, bend over putting your awareness hands on the kundalini, keep a straight back (your not gunna be able to raise much in a wheel chair now are ya), and Lift, using the Will to Lift.  Focus on an image of my guru to gain some assistance from above - i mean theres not much chance that you wilul be raising more Kundalini in one Lift than my guru lets face it.  Once you have raised, just let go and let the kundalini fall again for a mystical experience.

G,day Jacara
<br>
<br>
Yes maybe you are right, it probably is a bit of a hard one to answer, &amp; I was just hoping to discover something I maybe havn't found yet or tried out.
<br>
<br>
I have tried out Roberts technique, but maybe I'm not doing that part of it correctly or I'm just a different case all together &amp; need to attack it a different way, a bit of lateral thinking, unfortunately I havn't hit it yet.
<br>
<br>
I read about Roberts spinal problems &amp; saw a similar circumstance to my own &amp; thought maybe he has some NEW answers (hehe, not a bad pun eh).
<br>
<br>
I did go down the Eastern medicine path as well, but was quite expensive &amp; temporary, plus, I ran out of funds. At present I'm on the Western path of medicine, but I don't like it's side effects, but find it necessary for a "normal" existence, which means I pop pills like M&amp;M's.
<br>
<br>
The upside of my condition is nightly OBE's. That is the ONLY relief I get, but those ones tend to be more spontaneous &amp; I gain control shortly after an exit, as opposed to being in control from the start.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, I'm cashed up again now, so maybe I'll give the Eastern medicine another shot &amp; see what happens
<br>
<br>
Adiraz, I see I have much to learn in this area (Kundalini) as I no understando, no comprehendo, but will catch up soon.

<section>
Too much said on this not to comment further...
<br>
<br>
First things first. There are MANY things that can awaken Kundalini energy and as far as few people having the experience, I can't state that to be true or not true. I have read much literature on the topic and can state my belief on the subject from the following experiences. A quick run down of what YOU WILL experience in a full awakening is as follows:
<br>
<br>
*A feeling fo fire that will shoot up from the base of your spine all the way and out the crown of your head. You may even feel a band of energy going out of your head but will feel extreme joy/bliss/sensation like no other. When it is happening, you can't stop it! Like the elevator in WIlly Wonka, it's UP and OUT!*
<br>
<br>
*Connected with the universe and what seems to be UNLIMITED ACCESS to the universal knowledge. You actually feel in the frame of mind that you can know everything, that is, you are open to it, not necessarily receiving it"
<br>
<br>
*Physically you feel better than the best orgasm you've probably ever had! And afterwards and for weeks to months to come you would very well see yourself sleeping less and doing MUCH more. Your actions are quick and perfect in excution, including heightened perceptions, smell, sight, hearing, precognitive, etc. However, you are also more open to emotional mood swings because everything is more open and sensative to energies around you.* (This in turn lead to profound changes in my business dealings, contacts with people, my physical appearance, stance, manner of speaking, eloquence, profoundness, and changes of personality that EVERYONE was taking notice and asking, "What has happened to you? You are so full of energy and can you give me some?")
<br>
<br>
Mr. Bruce states, "I worked out kundalini for myself, with no instruction. I should have died, but I did not." Thankfully I did not die either. My experience finally did end with my having to go to a hospital for 2 weeks to try to establish a healthy sleep pattern again. It was here that I had my first EEG and recording of very high Delta states when I was fully awake and Alert. This was after 5 MONTHS OF WORKING WITH IT! Had I had a Guru as recommended, I would have learned much better grounding techniques, and how to channel the energy in a more healthy fashion. And the coming down from such a high was SCARY as sin itself. It's like getting a cow to go up stairs, not too damn hard, but down, OH BOY! Going up in energy is easy because IT IS the natural progression, just like it's easier to go from poor to rich in material wealth (not talking greed, talking comfort level afforded when money is properly used). You connect with Godhead and other forms of higher self, guided, everything. Very fasinating.
<br>
<br>
I had been practicing active meditation, energy work, energy rising, primary chakra work, channeling, inspirational writing and intense prayer and mantra for many years before this occurred. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I stated, "I PRAY FOR DEATH, GIVE ME A SHAMANIC DEATH!" Whammo!, that's when the serpant awoke. The room became dead silent as if in a vacuum, (like when you go up in an airplane and your ears clog up), and finally the fire and rushing of energy. INCREDIBLE!
<br>
<br>
I was neither scared or in pain, just weeping in joyful bliss and thanking God for hearing my prayers. And there was a new, very incredible view of the world around me. I was now connected to everything, animals, earth, people, everything!
<br>
******THIS ENERGY CANNOT BE MISTAKEN FOR ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! WHEN YOU HAVE IT YOU WILL KNOW, NO DOUBTS WHATSOVER!***** You cannot liken it to a lucid dream, or OOBE, or psychic flash, or wonderful Reiki session or anything else. It's like plugging a 110V appliance onto a 220V circuit, IT IS SUPER CHARGED ENERGY!
<br>
It's not raised once, it comes on in 'waves' afterwards of varying degrees, but seldom, if ever, as strong as it does the first time it "AWAKENS" because this is where the initial release is made and the pathways are shaped for how your body releases and channels it. If you have blockages, if you have areas that you have not worked on, if you have not prepared mentally or stated your intent at the onset, there may be 'unpleasant consequences' in releasing such energy too soon. By unpleasant I mean, through lack of understanding of what is really going on. It's like someone having to have a heart attack to find other things wrong with them in their body that they should have known about before and done something sooner.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes 'negative' side-affects and events help us to move through things we are unwilling to acknowledge and help us to make it through what we 'thought' we could not handle. At all times, not sometimes, Fear is best conquered when having to deal with it as it is, otherwise it wouldn't be your fear now would it? If I am afraid of the dark and not spiders and you keep dangling spiders in front of me, then how am I going to get over the fear of the dark thing?
<br>
<br>
And with regards to so few having the experience, please believe me when I state that it is overrated in who ever says you should try to have one. Like any other modality or school of thought and study you wish to pursue, you only get out of it what you put into it and if you are working with other methods that are working VERY well for you, then 99.9% of you will NOT have a Kundalini most likely. It's like learning trying to learn EVERYTHING that the school teacher knows in order to pass the one class subject they are teaching. It is in know way necessary for you to know all they know for you will pass proficiently with what they teach you and you will go on to learn other things you need to learn 'specifcally' for where you are to go in life and what vocation or thing you wish to pursue in YOUR LIFE.
<br>
<br>
In this respect I believe that Robert Bruce is teacher with many gifts and advanced experiences. I myself am on this path and have been told I would be since I was 4.The only difference between Robert and I is what a good friend of mine had told me a long time ago. And before you think me pompous in holding myself in high regard, please read the following which has changed my life forever!
<br>
<br>
I have a friend who was a mentor to me, went to M.I.T., earned 2 PHd's, worked on the Apollo missions for NASA, speaks 5 languages and is working on advanced theories that could possibly replace maxwell's equations one day. I said to him one day, "Paul, you are SO MUCH SMARTER than I am at things, I will never be as smart as you..." (I was 21 at the time, he was already 61). You know what he said to me, and you should really take it to heart before you hold anyone so high, including Mr. Bruce, (sorry sir)...he said, "The only difference between you and I is that you haven't been tested yet. Sure, I went to M.I.T., I got my 2 PHd's, I wrote papers that got published and so on...hell, I could very well be smart, but it's only because I was told that I was going to be tested on what I was going to school for and I made it a point to learn what I was learning, and to learn it well. You are seeing a man who has lived 61 years and has questioned himself time and again, checking his life the way he would equations and thankfully, somehow, godwilling, I think I've gotten it right? You see the result of my life, the house, the wife, the 3 children, my PHd's on the wall, but what you did not see was the work it took to get there. Give yourself time, learn everything you can, and when the time comes, you will be tested. Whether you pass or fail is up to you, so your best bet is to simply be ready."
<br>
<br>
When he said that at me, "WHOA!" I was blown away!!! I never really saw it that way, nor did I have as much respect for myself as this guy obviously had. I had always compared myself to others in regard to what they had, or accomplished and looked at myself in a manner of, you have to catch up or do better and so on. What I was missing, what was wasted on me was all of the compliments and remarks people had made of me all of those 21 years while I was growing up. I was struggling to acheive certain things in my life based on the distorted views I had of my own self image. I had failed to see all of the good qualities I had already and the work I had put in already in making it to 21 years of age. And with my friend Paul, he was right. I didn't see the fact that he was 1 of 13 children and had to do well in school in order to make it, came from another country (Canada) and was in school until he was 28-29 years old. That he didn't make much money for the first 15-20 years of his life and had lived in the same home for over 30 years. I was only seeing what he had amassed and accomplished later on.
<br>
<br>
It's very difficult to write about yourself in the positive, we are not taught to view ourselves that way. We are so on guard and protective of our fragile egos that we are quick to take the defensive to those who speak in the positive about themselves. I have always been told the following of myself:
<br>
<br>
*I am highly intuitve, I am well spoken, I am intelligent, deep, creative, artistic and musically gifted (play piano and perfect pitch) Mechanically and Technically inclined, well developed EQ (emotional quotient), well developed feminine side, secure in my sexuallity (have no trouble hugging a man or kissing men on the cheek as sign of affection in public, just brought up that way), so this might include gregarious, demonstrative qualities as well. A leadership type person (good at taking charge and leading others), inventive, loving and a good guy, even nice. Terms I heard time and again but never accepted fully. If someone said, "You're a nice guy..." I'd reply, "no, really..." and shy away... and when you think about it, isn't that a real slap in the face to the other person who is paying you the compliment? You rob them of the joy of doing so, (I like giving people sincere compliments) and also, you are saying to some degree, "Your words mean s**t to me, I don't really believe you and you are basically wasting your breath." Think about it. Why would they say it if they didn't mean it. New rule, and you have to believe if, you don't have a choice. If someone tells you something about yourself and you've heard it at least one or two other times from others as well, then it must be true. Period. That includes the negative as well as the good. I've sat and reflected on the negative and tried to make it better. Sometimes the truth really does hurt.
<br>
<br>
What I am getting at people is, "Please, take a good hard look at yourself. Assess the work you've done up to this point. Release the ego and realize, you've come VERY far in spiritual terms by even joining forums such as this." There are people who are good with money in life, some with business, some with people, some with agriculture and the list goes on. You have chosen the spiritual path and as harsh as it sounds that you might not have a Kundalini experience pleass ask yourself, "What is my real intent in having one, to wear it like a badge and brag, I had that too, or because I truly think it will change my life in such a way that I need to have it or never feel complete?" In regards to Mr. Bruce, he is a master in his own right and has acomplished much indeed. I hold him in high regards and experienced in the realm of OOBE and Astral travel but not at the expense of re-enforcing self-doubt about myself like so many newbies and bodhi's do when learning something new. You see it in so many groups, the one who thinks they aren't going to get it going on to be better than the rest who thought they were better...funny the way the universe works.
<br>
<br>
I've thrown a lot out here. Blast me if you wish. Hopefully you will re-read this post if you are on the defensive with the ego and think I am coming from that place as well. If so, please go back and read this as if your brother or loved one was telling you, because friend, there is much I have to learn about other aspects that I have or may not be able to. Please master those if you are already on that path and share with me the same raw truth. Collectively, we might one day come up with the final answer.
<br>
<br>
Namaste,
<br>
John

This looked like a fun thread to kick some life into again.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone hear read that while the kundalini is dormant she is not completely inactive, but instead that she is responsible for keeping us alive? Or that she is responsible for providing much of the prana we use, the way heat radiates off of a hot object?

It has been said that the Dark Forces work through the identification or stimulation of the psychic mechanism so that the lower psychic powers become abnormally developed and prematurely assume proportions which are almost uncontrolable.  Through the etheric body the physical body is afflicted in the form of diseases, nervous conditions, lesions and brain afflictions and many other ways in which the individual is rendered helpless and unfitted to cope with daily living and world conditions.
<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that one may develop psychic powers through different practices, but to what end?

Sorry to Resurrect this old topic, but there are some important things going on here, and I wasn't a member of this forum then.  I think Grenade (who I THOUGHT started this topic) I think Grenade's authentic experience left off when the dripping began.
<br>
<br>
A lot of the people on this thread were just pumping Robert for information, either to relay to their "Gurus" or as a good time for their "psivamps".
<br>
<br>
I have to say that the stuff Robert was talking about experiencing himself was A HUGE TEACHING, probably from an angel named KUNDALINI&gt;&gt;&gt;'I worked out KUNDALINI for myself, with no instruction.  I should have died, but I did not.  Now I walk with angels and think at levels even I do not understand!  DELIGHTFULLY SO, SAID KUNDALINI.
<br>
<br>
It is true that you can go crazy if someone tries to mess with your energy configuration: this happened to me, and I think that's all these kundalini myths refer to.
<br>
<br>
Sorry, Robert, but when Patty asked for your photo, I think they were just trying to get a bead on your energy signature (called 'astral signature' by one of my PERPSicons).
<br>
<br>
I have looked the thread over again, and realized that this thread was actually started by distant bell, but I guess kakkarot knew that wasn't important when he gave me this link.

Ive been having much kundalini activity both for good and worse thise weeks. Anyway i seem to have gotten a meager amount of controll over it . I can turn it on now. But not off. Wich is off course the "skill" i realy want[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
].
<br>
<br>
Ohh well getting the turn on skill i guess is like handing a man whos house is on fire ,petrol and matches[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
].
<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing is, i was at a healer thinking what the heck(even thought i heard about a 1000 warnings about it)
<br>
It felt very like kundalini itself (thought dimmer feeling and no "serpent/hands feelings). But after Kundalini have begun to spread a little more evenly in the body ,wich is not the worst that could happen.
<br>
<br>
The pshycologist have come to the conclusion that even though i got some serius screwed up inputs via my feeling sence I am not pshycotic or mentally ill in other aspects (thanx for small blessings )[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
].
<br>
<br>
Anyway my doctor is sending me to an EXTENSIVE brain survey/scan thingy(forgot what it is called but it measures brain activity like EEG) to check for anamolous erh activity in a few months(long waiting list), So atleast with the turn on skill i can be pretty sure of having a "Sezuire"[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
]  ,when the test is taken .
<br>
<br>
In the mean time i guess i just got to try and cope and bliss on with my life.

These seizures wouldn't by any chance be like electric shocks that feel like your brains is trying to evaporate and spread all over your body? Happen after meditation or in the morning after a long sleep period?
<br>
<br>
I ask becuase I get that sort of thing and the closest thing literature comes is SSRI withdrawal symptoms, only I've never taken any so I canät have withdrawal can I?

For those whit spesial interest in this phenomenon , the word
<br>
Speirema is the western counterpart to Kundalini .It comes from greec originally .While kundalini has its roots somewhere in the east.
<br>
I checked and it seems very googlebla(3 pages).
<br>
<br>
So what you think , does Kundalini or Speirema has the most lyrical/emotional impact on you ?[

This is question to Robert Bruce and everyone,who reads this.I heard,and read,that once kundalini is awaked,you will unlock all your supernatural powers(siddhis) like telepathy,teleportation,telekinesis,and much
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///more.is" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 more.Is
</a>
this true,and if yes, does anyone has some psychic ability,after rising kundalini?

Robert wrote way back when that: "Kundalini needs to be developed. It is energy dependent, just like the OBE or Vision Screen states."
<br>
<br>
What is a vision screen state?  Is it just like it sounds - a screen superimposed over the field of vision during an altered state that shows a view of something?
