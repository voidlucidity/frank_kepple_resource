Well in my experience I don't really have a whole lot of control over which destination I arrive.  I guess I'd like to think my "guides" take care of that...However I'm sure I could go wherever I wanted to with enough practice.  However, most of the time I just walk around my distorted surroundings.  I usually fallout of it by the time I actually go somewhere else.. unfortunately

 Please share your experience. I know many people when they are out of their body they will see spirits. I meant ghosts. But it does not mean you are a ghost. For example: That I know I am one of the gods, the reason that I know I am a god because I can visit other parts of universe.

 They all seem to recognize me by my god title. And they would kneel in front of me and called me by my title.

I found this very interesting!
<br>
<br>
Just this morning I found myself once again in someones dream.  By the end of it I was wondering...geez, am I like some kind of helper, guide or just a subconscious thought to them.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't go so far as to say they thought I was a god, but I did get the distinct feeling that I was there to show him something...to bring up a light bulb moment if you will.

<br>
<br>
May I ask what God title they give you, and is it the same place everytime  you visit, that this happens?
<br>
<br>
Take Care,

 When you find yourself in someone's dream, I could almost assume that you have a angel status. I will give you an example: Usually, this is a job of Angles or the nuns from the Heaven. They are able to come to human dreams and heal them or help humans for all different reasons. And even you are human now, but your soul could slip out and still doing the same functions that you did before. So, the chances are you could be an angel reborn on earth. What is your mission on earth? That I do not know. That you might want to find out.

<br>
I'm a bit embarrassed by what you say, only because I feel I'm totally not worthy of that status......YET, your question brings up interesting facts that happened to me a few months ago which I posted about. (don't bother, I can't remember where..lol)
<br>
<br>
Without boring you...I was in an experience where the person said "I should have been able to find you, especially with all that purple around you"
<br>
<br>
We...grrrrrrr..this is bothering me, I know the person that responded..I just can't remember their nic..

Anyhoo, she gave some wonderful insight on what colors meant and so on.  I went to searching and it all seemed very positive.  Woot, for me

 I would reveal my God title but at this point I prefer not to say it, I do not want to accused that I am insane. Laughing But I can assure you that I am not Jesus. LOL
 <br>
 <br>
 I am able to go all different places, each time could be different.
 <br>
 <br>
 Other beings in other part of universe are able to ask help from me, too. Then I would appear over their world, I have no fear. Because I know when I am out of human body, I am immortal.
 <br>
 <br>
 And I have magic powers, for example I have a sword would follow me everywhere in the universe even when I am out of human body.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are many ways to know if you are immortal. But I also curious and wanted to know if any body are able to be out of human earth and to other levels of universe? Beacuse I know there are many levels of universe.

 Do tell me more. You were helping them doing what?

I will say that in my astral travels I have magic powers too....but I think I just don't get it at "the time".....lol...  it is only after the fact when I say..."whoa, girlfriend, you just kick arse!"   I guess what I am saying and what I've done over the years equates to

Well, I found myself in a childs dream.. and he played football (american football, just to make it clear)  And his coach hit him, when he didn't get the results he wanted.  Infact, I witnessed and felt the abuse.
<br>
<br>
I then found myself speaking with the coach, and a mother (whom was to my left, sitting in a ATV)  The coach (never got his name...never..grrr..)  Was speaking with the mom...kinda arguing.  (at this point, I felt he was over bearing for her)  I stepped up between them and tried to inturrupt.  He at first did not like this inturruption..and tried to push me to the side, not only by physical means, but by emotional means....his look alone was hurtful.
<br>
<br>
I just looked up at him and said.."if you will just let me say this ONE thing, I'll leave you alone"
<br>
<br>
Amazing how the emotional feeling around me shifted...  He was open and looking me STRAIGHT in the eyes.   He was tall though...lol..thank goodness that doesn't effect me anymore.!
<br>
<br>
I looked him straight in his eyes as well, and said...."do you realize that you complimented that child only AFTER he did what you wanted..yet he didn't want to do that for you, he only did it to avoid you?"   I then looked at the mother and said..."you didn't know that did you?, that he hits them?"
<br>
<br>
She never answered me.  But he did.
<br>
<br>
He lifted his hand to smack me.....it was coming, I braced myself for it.
<br>
<br>
Once again...lol...that whole looking into the eyes thing came up.  I looked him dead in the eyes, with my chin upright proud and said very succinctly..."do it, cause that will be the end of you"
<br>
<br>
I then woke up.
<br>
<br>
I am a bit tired of waking up during the weird times..lol..but have learned to live with it.

Hey Nay, loved your story!  I was curious though as to how you knew you were in his dream? Was it that fact that the dream revolved around the boy?
<br>
<br>
As for me, I don't really think to look at myself out body.  I'v seen spirits floating in air as a rainbow of colors--kind of like a wind.  I have also seen them as a black and white--like looking as a tv image.
<br>
<br>
I'v never left this earth realm to my knowledge.  But for all I know any other place could look very similar.
<br>
<br>
I'd have to say my favorite projection experience was when I went camping once.  Enjoying the great outdoors! I took a nap and I had the most peaceful obe.. and it happened so effortlessly

god status?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
awesome.  I don't wish to tear you down at all but through my experience of OBE's I tend to shape my surroundings with my mind and have control over most things.  If I wanted to be in front of a huge crowd that bowed to me and called me King Gobo or something I could.  I don't want to insult you and I am very interested in your experiences, but how do you know that your mind isn't creating these experiences???  Just the other day I woke up and was out of my body.  I didn't know it until my dresser drawer opened and a head came out of it, peering at me.  I thought "who the hell is that??? this isn't making any sense!!!" then I realized what was going on.  I thought "gee, it would be lovely if that person in my dresser was my friend from work" and it was her, just as I thought it should be.
<br>
<br>
I got bored with this strange experience and asked to be taken to the akashic records, it was the first time I actually remembered to try and go there, usually I am too in awe at the fact I am out to begin with and get wrapped up in attempting to mold my surroundings to my wants and impulses.  I melted and lost my sense of self, shot through space and seemed to break the sound barrier because I heard a large wooshing and a bang as I shot through a circle of light and I was in front of a massive computer screen like the ones you see on TV where you can use your fingers to move things around on the screen.  I was taken aback!!  I thought I would be in a library, but it seemed almost tailored to me since I am very literate with computers.  Every experience I have seems to be based around what I want or whats going on in the very back of my mind.  Maybe as I progress and explore more, this will change, but I don't think so.  Your input would be awesome.

Hello Sapphire!
<br>
<br>
I have a question:
<br>
<br>
From where do you know that your experiences are not just created by your mind, that the other beings are real and not just your fantasy?
<br>

I agree with creating things with your mind.  Sapphire is obviously experiencing things differently than I am.  Perhaps it is because I have no desire what so ever to be a God in anyones eyes!

<br>
<br>
With my dream yesterday it was just that, a dream.   I wasn't trying to project or anything.
<br>
<br>
The last few months I've been trying to figure out why when I dream lately I'm finding myself in what seems like other peoples dreams or ummm..not worlds but different scenerios that seem to be there for a purpose.
<br>
<br>
In my dream with the man, I got the feeling that I popped into his dream to show him that he needs to stop hitting these kids.  Now, is that man a real man somewhere on this planet?  I have no idea..lol.  I do know that even though I have a good imagination, there is no way I could think up all these different looking people.   You would think if I was doing this myself that they would start looking like each other or something.

<br>
<br>
Vvid:  I just popped into the scene.  I was an observer....well, until I couldn't help but put my two cents in..
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I sometimes look at myself in my dreams, sometimes see things in my head, sometimes see it from a third person view (meaning, I will hover over the entire scene, including my dream self)  I have even gone into the person and heard their thoughts as well as mine.  That is interesting.

I must say your posts are extremely interesting!  Heavenly chocolates???  Gotta get me some of them!  I have had 2 projections where I have been forced into a place and had no choice, at least not in my mind, to save someone who was powerless from a situation that was horrific to say the least.  I have always been going along minding my own astral business when I am suddenly in a place with a very dark atmosphere and I can feel someone in distress.  Sometimes I will hear them crying a few rooms away or I am in front of them and feel someone or something very bad coming to harm them.
<br>
<br>
I am as you describe with a full body, full color.  I feel a deep need to help the person and empowered by great strength to do so.  The last time it happened I was on a platform that connected 2 buildings and I could see through the window a girl laying in the corner in a very strange state.  I crossed over and looked at her and saw that she was made out of plastic like a doll, bluish purple plastic and she grimaced up at me in agony and she couldn't move.  I told her it was going to be OK and I was going to help her and her eyes started darting around like she was expecting someone to come and kill both of us.  She couldn't talk, she could only whimper and seemed utterly terrified.  I suddenly felt like all the air was being sucked from the room and felt like things where getting darker all around me.  The girl went frantic and started to cry and thrash her head back and forth.  I scooped her up and darted back over the bridge connecting the buildings and layed her down.  She started to return to a normal state and thanked me with more vigor than I have ever seen from anyone before, she ran off quickly before I could ask her anything.  I looked back over the bridge and it was black in the room I had just left and all I could see was 3 huge red eyes.
<br>
<br>
Maybe I saved her???  Is this the type of thing your talking about?  I felt like I had done something amazing and helped her more than I knew, but I hadn't really thought about what it all meant or if it was more than just a fantasy before.  This was indeed a very unique experience, much more real and vivid than my usual experiences.  I have only had  2 experiences like this, but I wont forget either of them.

I do find it interesting about the chocolate as well.  Particularly that they are shaped as shells.  I once had a lucid and this man handed me a handful of these colorful shells.  Not necessarily chocolate but some sort of candy I guess, but I ate a couple..heheh

Sorry I missed some posts..my dang contacts decided they did not want to live anymore and thus have left me quite blind and I have at least 4 more days until my new ones come in..grrrrrrr...this squinting and leaning two  inches away from the screen is not fun, so I'm sticking to the mods forum..lol

Heaven chocolate ? God status ? heaven god ?
<br>
You are a god and you can't even spell properly ? There is even a spell checker on this forum. You write like a 12 year old MIRC kiddie. Plus you say you have read this forums for some time - yet you have no (i say again: NO) knowledge about astral and the Alice in wonderland effect.
<br>
<br>
First i thought it was a joke - and all the other were just making fun. But it's the 4th page already - I'm starting to believe you are all serious down here.
<br>
<br>
To all the other except the OP: How big is your ego ? You hear you're some sort of god and you're starting to believe it? If i say you are idiots I'll get banned and none of you will give it a thought...
<br>
<br>
Sapphire - You say you are the only one who can leave earth - have you ever read a book on this subject at least ?
<br>
<br>
I know because of this post i`ll get perhaps 20 minds directing hatred towards me and a ban but i`ll take the risk.
<br>
<br>
The "best" part was when you (sapphire) said you went to hell and saw all those people and their sins - and you thought: "they deserve what they get down there". I wonder the kind of justice you would actually serve if you were a GOD. You have no actual understanding of cause and effect do you ?
<br>
<br>
There must be something else in heaven (or the land of the highest rank gods with blue dots and Golden status) except chocolates - maybe idiots?
<br>
<br>
I have just one request before someone bans me or takes any kind of action towards this message: don't edit my message, don`t delete my message. You can ban me, ignore me, even reply with even more cynicism, but for the sakes of free will please leave my message alone.
<br>
<br>
Why I care so much about this message is because I think this is the typical example from where all the mysticism and fanaticism, which Franks talks about,  is coming from. This is an example of the early stages for a future mystic.

I can astral project sometimes.  Not really at will though.  I have tried to leave earth but i can't do it yet.  I can fly pretty well.  I can't fly very fast though.  can you tell me how to leave earth and experience places in the astral that can help me spiritually.  Also i was curios to how you astral project.  What methods do you use to astral project.  thanks.

<section>
Witan and Sapphire, i have a question for both of you...
<br>
<br>
First i would like to start off with witan....Now why do you personally take the scientific approach to life??? i am just curious. Would you rather believe in something that people have such a limited knowledge of, that i can't stress enough MOST OF THE KNOWLEDGE THEY DO HAVE IS MADE UP AND NOT PROVEN AT ALL!!!! i mean at least people can actually report SOME evidence of astral projection!!! THEY ARE ALL THEORIES THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE for example creation of the universe etc.Or would you rather infinite knowledge. Now i have read many a theory that scientists have made up ( not that i have a grudge or anything towards science ) but some of them are just plain ridiculous! How can you honestly doubt, or say anything about astral projection, etc is not real? People try and look for the most logical thing possible, and just cause someone can't fly here doesn't mean they can't somewhere else.
<br>
<br>
And sapphire i have a question about dreams, as i noticed there was a couple of posts about them, and you said that when we dream, we may be out of body. Well here goes... I have begun to notice that i "live" my dreams more. I still do not become fully lucid, but i "go through them" till i wake up. anyway if i am out of body, why are my dreams always dark, and mostly negative. For example the other night i had a dream that i was in my school, and in one of the corridors. I was then being chased after someone that was trying to harm me... Most of my dreams appear like this. Am i a magnet for negs, and are the dark just because it is night?

<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
It is in my nature to be polite and slightly ironic all the time, but that's not really obvious after reading that last message is it ?
<br>
astral man - don`t change the topic. I am not referring to science versus anything at the moment. I don`t really care who is right actually. But can`t you see what is happening here ? Cultism at its highest.
<br>
The whole thing sounds like: I am a God because I know it, I can OBE with ease, and beings told me I am GOD, besides that I can leave Earth - no one else can. What did you say John ? You had a similar experience ? Let me check something for a second....   Yes, I was right, you are a Red Dot God - which is half immortal (whatever that means, maybe you live half the life of an immortal god - so that means you will basically live for ever - still you`re not a God but a Red Dot God). Yes I've been to Hell - and I must tell you, believe it or not - it is REALLY HOT there (yes they have chocolate in hell too - but it's all melted), and I wanted to help - but then I saw what that man did in his life after his parents were killed in his face in his childhood, yes he deserves to be tormented forever. If i say so it must  be so i guess, no ? I am a God after all. What Witan, what did you say ? I have a big ego or I'm trying to deceive others ? Hmmm let me check something - yes, i was right again, wow, you are a demon trying to deceive these angels with cool powers to find the truth.
<br>
<br>
I have nothing against OBE experiences - but I think it would be best for everyone to use reason before they come to the conclusion they are GODS. The whole thing is hilarious - (yes they have chocolate in heaven).

Thank you Witan,it was about time that someone took him (god/sapphire) to task.  I hope Sapphire is a 15 year old boy and not some 35 year old looking to start a cult.  Now I know that some believe that we are all "gods", and this may or may not be true.  That is not what I wanted to discuss, it was Sapphire's holier than thou attitude that needed to be astrally B*tch slapped.
<br>
<br>
It reminded me of those mystics that rank OBE as one of the "highest" forms of spiritual enlightenment that only they can achieve.  Then, the proceed to act as gurus telling people they are not ready to learn that technique yet, so they get this "shut up, fall in line and worship me attitude"  Thank god we are quickly learning that all this mystical dogma is just a bunch of hogwash, or at best covered in thick layers of crud.

 But there are risk involved, because when you are out of earth, lots of other gods and beings will see you. They might capture you, so I do not recommend you get out of the earth. I was just very daring and careless about if I was able to make it back (if you can not make it back, your human body might become "Vegetable" the body is here, but the soul was gone.) I was captured many times, but because I have a god status, and own many magic powers, so I always make it to rescue myself and make it to come back

<section>
Well I do agree the term 'god' is a little or even a lot exaggerated.  This is because of my background and how I'v viewed that term my whole life.  However, I have no clue of Sapphire's history and actual definition of 'god' is.  Perhaps not as extreme ( maybe lost in translation). Take it with a grain of salt or whatever.
<br>
<br>
I do, however, have an argument against people's beliefs in this whole 'rabbit hole effect' and how it's only themselves.  Yes I believe in the astral you can manifest and see whatever you like.  It has been said many times that you are projecting into your own mind...The problem I see with this is, we are ultimately all connected.  Energy is constantly being exchanged among people.  What stops Us from projecting into someone else's mind? someone else's experiences or problems?  I've heard many accounts of people projecting, meeting, and later both recalling the same obe.  How is this possible if it's only within one mind?
<br>
<br>
I believe souljah was touching on this in another thread...but if we have the ability to choose what we see, we also have the ability to choose what NOT to see.  If we choose only to see flowers and people that are already happy, we will see them.  At the same time we are choosing not to see people of a lower freq that are in need of help, perhaps.  And yes there are people that are in need of help today--we all are.
<br>
<br>
just keep an open mind, is what Im saying

 Sapphire - this is intended to help you although it may not seem that obviuos. I'm trying to show that the conclusions you make are ridicoulus. Is it that hard to understand that Astral is a THOUGHT-SENSITIVE place ? Where your thoughts become reality ? If you can`t grasp that concept than there is nothing else for me to say.

 Well I do agree the term 'god' is a little or even a lot exaggerated.  This is because of my background and how I'v viewed that term my whole life.  However, I have no clue of Sapphire's history and actual definition of 'god' is.  Perhaps not as extreme ( maybe lost in translation). Take it with a grain of salt or whatever.
 <br>
 <br>
 I do, however, have an argument against people's beliefs in this whole 'rabbit hole effect' and how it's only themselves.  Yes I believe in the astral you can manifest and see whatever you like.  It has been said many times that you are projecting into your own mind...The problem I see with this is, we are ultimately all connected.  Energy is constantly being exchanged among people.  What stops Us from projecting into someone else's mind? someone else's experiences or problems?  I've heard many accounts of people projecting, meeting, and later both recalling the same obe.  How is this possible if it's only within one mind?
 <br>
 <br>
 I believe souljah was touching on this in another thread...but if we have the ability to choose what we see, we also have the ability to choose what NOT to see.  If we choose only to see flowers and people that are already happy, we will see them.  At the same time we are choosing not to see people of a lower freq that are in need of help, perhaps.  And yes there are people that are in need of help today--we all are.
 <br>
 <br>
 just keep an open mind, is what Im saying

Sapphire - yeah, most of my experiences are of me flying.  It's such a great experience.  - sometimes it's kinda hard.  -  I've never had any conversations - or heard any.  - My obes usually occur during lucid dreaming.  After having a very vivid dream - my awareness changes - and it's usually becomes dark and fresh- My last OBE i remember asking for my "spirit guide" and my cat came
<i>
 out
</i>
- not to my surprise.  I was almost expecting it to be that.
<br>
<br>
Astral Man - try changing your perspective about OBE's.  Maybe you kinda have a fear for them that's why your getting your negative reactions.  My OBE's have ranged greatly, depending on my mood and state of mind at the time.  It's really no surprise to me some of the expereinces I've had - it all depending on my state of mind at that time.  u know?  Start having a
<i>
 like
</i>
for them and I'm sure they'll start changing, for the pos.

I think that Sapphire believes in what she says about being a God. Honestly, i dont care if she(or he?!) is a god or not...really. So, why mind with that?
<br>
<br>
The storys about chocolate in heaven and so, are funny and interesting...these are things that she/he sees in the astral and i like that kind of things. Since saphire it is not offending no one neither trying to create any cult (well..i think not), i dont care if you have 15 years and you are lying or if you have indeed obes and you are god.
<br>
<br>
Well, it would be interesting to really know that what you say its true, that would be better...
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, i think that the "god" condition its reached when your all life reeicarnates/get to live in another realm of existence....if AP realms are real.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, you can reach a much more powerfull (whatever that means) god state by reaching the inner understanding of all things...i mean, if you get like Buddha, with a True view of everythinh (i am supposing that some storys about Buddha are real).

<section>
I don't care if Sapphire thinks he is a god or not, that is not the issue here.  It is the things HE KNOWS to be true that I care about.  These things are the same old "scare the Sh*T out of you" mystic dogma that should have died out 300 years ago.  I will give examples:
<br>
<br>
1. Devils will steal your soul-negs are everywhere myth:  When I first started to OBE is was scared Sh*tless of these "creatures", and this stupid belief really stunted my progress.  It wasn't until I started to read Franks post that the "ball droped" and I realized and confirmed that focus 2 is really inside of me and not outside.  Recently, when i phase to focus 2 I am much more calm and collected and think more about going to focus 3 than looking for a neg around every corner.  This is how you make progress.  I love when Sapphire says that he is the ONLY one that can handle these creatures.  I laughed at this because that is what EVERYONE does when they first go to Focus 2--KILL ALL NEGS (astral warrior type Cr*P)
<br>
<br>
2.  He is the only one that can leave earth:  IS HE SERIOUS?  with phasing I usually don't go to focus 1(or the real time zone), and so I guess I leave earth also.  Same "I am more enlightened than you, so you are not ready to learn argument" that mystics have used to keep themselves above there subjects for centuries.  Has he ever heard of William Bulhman, Robert Bruce, Frank, Major Tom, Adrian, etc X 100 people here!  He is the only one that can leave earth--HA (too funny).
<br>
<br>
<br>
All I can say is to use critical thinking.  You can be open minded, but I am guessing most of you are young.  This is fine because you still have an open mind, however there are always people out there that will want to fleece you to prop up themselves (whether monetarily or otherwise).  Sapphire just sounds like he is coming to conclusions based upon ego masturbation.
<br>
<br>
oh, and Sapphire I bet that EVERYONE here knows about Remote viewing.  It is also very easy to just list "psychic skills" as if you can do them.  Watch, I can do it too:
<br>
<br>
Levitation
<br>
Teleportation
<br>
Bilocation
<br>
ESP
<br>
Transmutation
<br>
etc

He is talking about focus 2 in most post, and MAYBE Focus 3 (in Franks linear model).  Although, he packages it up like no one else can do the same (HA).  IMO, Frank is WAY beyond Sapphire in terms of projection experience and understanding of Astral projection.
<br>
<br>
However, many people love to latch on to the mystical interpretations of things because they are more "sexy/mysterious".

My first OBE i remember wanting to see heaven + hell.
<br>
<br>
I woke up knowing I was out of body, got out of bed, just tried to remain calm walked over to my wall, stuck my arm through it.  Cool!!  Hopped outside, started floating around -here to there, around my backyard.   While outside I thought about God/heaven.  'I wonder if I can reach heaven'.  I started flying up.  I'm in a room with other people trying to open a door-safe thing on the ceiling that supposedly lead to heaven.  We couldn't get it open.  I flew back down.  I'm outside my house again floating around.  'Maybe I should try hell'.  Kinda hesitantly, a little nervous, I start flying underground.  I kinda get nervous - I start hearing evil laughter and a face of a devil kinda pops out at me.  Laughing evily 'NEVERMIND' - i fly back out.
<br>
This was probably my most vivid-clear experience.  That week I had really been wanting to experience one - i had been listening to hemi-sync cds, just trying to fall asleep in the right mood, and all that.
<br>
Basically I think the OBE place projects your thoughts/feelings all simultaneously - imaginations of your mind
<br>
That's probably why Sapphire has all these type of experiences - it's just the type of person he/she is.
<br>
U can get an idea about what's going on in a person's mind by hearing they're experiences.  U know?

 The judge looked at me (He could not tell I am a God.) And he was able to sentence me. That was ridicules, first of all. He could not tell that I am not really dead. Secondly, he could not give me fair hearing. Thirdly, he could not tell I am a God.
 <br>
 <br>
 But I waited patiently, until he finished his words. I stood up. (I am very clear minded know who I am, you need to be, too when OBE.) I was much bigger than him, because I am a god.
 <br>
 <br>
 I said to him : "Sentence, my butt." (Pardon my french.) "First of all you could not tell I am a god. Secondly, you could not even tell I am not actually dead. And you have no ability to give fair hearings." I fired him and got a god from the kingdom of Heaven to be the "Judge". Who are able to give fair hearing and having the ability to actually view what the humans did while they were alive and judge them from there. And have the ability to see if the soul is still having live human body on earth and able to tell if the soul is a god or goddess from the kingdom of Heaven or kingdom of gods.
 <br>
 <br>
 By the way if you are a god or goddess from the Kingdom of Heaven, you can only be judged by the Judge from the kingdom of gods, and if you are a god or goddess, you suffer no Karma. And you can not be judged, you just come back to the Kingdom of gods. But the king of all gods rules over there.
 <br>
 <br>
 Trust me, there were a god from the kingdom of gods was judged by mistake and sent to Heaven jail and suffered unnecessary.

 Later, I was informed. I was requested to be there is because there were too much complaints about wrong judgment from that judge.

I was just curious if anyone had any comments/thoughts to my previous post
<br>
<br>
Also I had another thought.  If all we see is illusion within our own mind, wouldn't that rule out all possible ghosts/angels/or even spirit guides? I know Frank claimed to have a few.  It just seems sort of contradictory when it is all "manifested."
<br>
<br>
Although, I do realize it was said that spirits reside above "focus 2"...However, there seem to have been accounts of people communing with them in focus2 and also having projections ABOVE 'focus2' where they actually have interacted with whichever ghost/guide/etc...
<br>
<br>
Im not necessarily attacking this theory, just analyzing what I've soaked up thus far.  maybe once he finishes this book will it explain a bit more.

I don't want to write it out my analogy, so I will quote Frank
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 Take a look at the sun. It rises in the east and sets in the west. You follow its movement from one point to the next and it appears to be revolving around us. This is obvious, because we can see it does. Unfortunately, it is us that is revolving around it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Now, you project into the wider physical. I do not like using the term "real-time zone" because there is no such thing as "real" time and it is not a "zone". But we all kinda get what we mean so let's not complicate the issue on that score. So we project into the RTZ. You see yourself out of body. It is obvious you are out of body because you can see that you are. But what you are seeing is the equivalent of watching the sun revolving around the planet.
 <br>
 <br>
 You have not actually gone "out" of body at all. You have simply taken a step "back", so to speak, from the front-line physical in terms of your current focus, into the wider physical. You cannot go "out" of someplace where you were never "in" in the first place. If someone moves their location from point a to point b, this logically presupposes the person was actually at point a to begin with. If I want to go out of one room into another room I have to initially be in that first room.
 <br>
 <br>
 In terms of the body, we are not located in that first room, we are merely focused within it, as if from a distance, if you like. The analogy falls down rather quickly but imagine looking into room one from a distance through a telephoto lens, then you shift your focus to room two. In a sense, and only in a sense, this is what we are doing.
 <br>
 <br>
 As I have said many times, people get body fixated to the extent where their whole sense of thinking becomes relative to it. But a body is merely an objective representation of the accumulation of a particular set of expectations regarding the enactment of certain types of actions within particular areas of consciousness. It holds no other purpose.
 <br>
 <br>
 One of the most popular questions people ask me is, "Frank, what is the easiest way of me leaving my body?" You can't, there is no way at all you can leave your body. You can shift your focus of attention into the wider physical, you can shift it to Focus 2/3/4 but you cannot leave your body. There is no way you can step beyond the physical. The physical is an end result. Nothing exists outside of ourselves. Some people accept this but then start taking it way too far the other way and begin calling physical reality an illusion. I step short of that by a long way. Anyone who thinks physical reality is an illusion should walk into the nearest lamppost.
 <br>
 <br>
 It's not that physical reality is an illusion, it's the notion of objectivity that is the illusion. To understand what I mean by that you need to study the way the subjective translates into the objective, in terms of energy. This knowledge can be gained from Focus 4 and Focus 2 experiences. Particularly in regard to the way our perception creates our reality.
</blockquote>
<br>
I think of it as using an operating system such as Windows.  The physical is an open program on the desktop.  Most people spend there entire Wakeing lives working within that program.  When you "OBE" or phase you are simply minimizing that program and opening another to work in.  Most AP's work in the new program that has been dubbed Focus 2, however, if you minimize this one you can open a couple other ones, like Focus 3 and focus 4.  Death is closing the first program entirely.  The "RTZ" is a graphical user interface that looks like the first program, but is not.  So, when people think that it cannot be possible that everything is within us, they think we mean that ALL projection is done within the first program, and is just imagination or self delusion.  It is not.  When Frank talks about overlay experiences, he is talking (in my analogy) about the user of the computer toggling between two open windows. We would be the user of the operating system. Remember, Monroe said "We are more than our physical bodies".  I would say "We are more than our first program".

oh I see what you are saying Han.  That example does clear up a bit of confusion I had.
<br>
<br>
I was also wondering what happened to the other so-called 'planes'.  From countless sources, they describe our conciousness in terms of 7 planes/dimensions/focuses.  So I am assuming Frank is speaking of the first 4--the 4 he is familiar with.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Our wider reality is apportioned into 4 Primary Areas that, in my Phasing Model of Consciousness, I label Focus 1 to Focus 4 inclusive. Within these 4 Primary Areas are many, many of what might be called "planes" of reality. No offence meant, but I always chuckle when I hear mystics and their followers parroting the usual astral is, "7 planes and 7 sub-planes" stuff. There are millions and millions of them!
<br>
<br>
The wider reality is humongous, it is infinite. I don't know where all this 7x7 talk originated. I guess it's just traditional mystics trying to encapsulate it all in terms they can understand so they can present it to their followers. Keeps your publisher happy I suppose. :)
<br>
<br>
For the record, a Focus of Attention is not a Dimension. A Dimension is something completely different. From what I can gather from some of the mystical bits and bobs I have read, a "plane" could possibly be a Focus of Attention. But a plane could not be a Primary Area.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

This is exactly what I meant - he/she sounds like a cult leader, who cares he doesn`t recruit yet.

Sapphire - a cult isn't necessary a completely other religion. Go to a catholic/orthodox priest and tell him you are a God, let's see how he will react.

Tombo, now i see where you wanna get.
<br>
<br>
about being a buddha, i think that if a buddhist (be it bddha or not) want to help everyome, he can reeicarnate in order to to that.
<br>
<br>
the Dalai Lama for instance, its a reeicarnation of someone that wants to help others..for that reason he still being reincarnating.
<br>
<br>
just my opinion about buddhism and reeincarnation.

Sapphire:
<br>
<br>
Putting my Moderator hat on for a moment:
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like all you are doing is prosletysing buddhism under the guise of trying to teach people about astral projection. Nothing to be ashamed of I suppose. We get people trying this on now and again so most long-standing members here are used to it. But I would respectfully suggest that the affair has run it's course to the extent where it is time to close it all down.
<br>
<br>
With me, no disrespect, but I tend to wait until they start rambling on about white elephants and such like, and then that's a sign of closing time. What you are engaging here is not an OBE discussion. It is a Chat topic. If anyone objects then please make your voice heard. But later today I think this topic should be moved to Chat.

Forgive me, if you are something of an expert at Buddhism then please make your voice heard. It all just sounds a bit too not an OBE discussion for the OBE Discussions section. By my saying the person was prosletysing Buddism I didn't necessarily mean the person in question knew what they were talking about. :)

If it is not Buddism at all then I meant no offence if that is your particular religion. It's just that the word "Buddha" was mentioned a few times and I assumed Buddhism.

<br>
Nothings wrong, you just need to practice.  Read all the post in the FAQ's section and Permanent Astral topics, then read posts by Frank, and other moderators.  They will really help you with this SKILL.  I want to make sure you realize that it is a skill and not an ability doled out to a few "gods" like Sapphire would want you to think.  I have also projected "naturally" before, but what circumstances caused this is up for debate. Stick around and learn the techniques that will develop this skill.
<br>
<br>
Notice how Sapphire hasn't given any information on "Projecting with ease", just the same old "I am a high rank god" type stuff.  I suspect he would say something along the lines of "I am a high rank god, so therefore I can project with ease". Nice.
<br>
<br>
Sapphire, once you learn more about the liquid (thoughts=reality) characteristic of focus 2 I believe you will come to understand the misinterpretations of your experiences.  At face value, it looks as if you indeed have an ability to project, so I would recommend you read some of Frank's post on how to phase into Focus 3 from Focus 2.  It is there you will find your answers. Sorry for comming down on you so hard, but I felt your theories (so called facts) concerning Negs trying to trap people were detrimental to the development of many of the newer members here.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck,

Sapphire-

<br>
I understand what your saying about the god/goddess part.
<br>
<br>
Yeah that experience was very life-like, very realistic - I could see in full color etc.   I'm not too sure what you mean by full body. I never really looked down at my body -  my body was functioning as it always was normal.  - ex. I walked over to my wall, stuck my arm through etc.
<br>
<br>
I think the reason I couldn't get into 'heaven' is because my state of mind wasn't in the right place to do so.   I dunno tho.
<br>
<br>
(A lil bit about me) - I've always been a spiritual person - I've struggled alot along the way though.  It's kinda hard to let go of all these egotistical things.  Lately I've been falling asleep with a bottle of liquor by my side so I'm sure that messes up a few things-experiences.

Thanks Han, that helped a bit. I'll go read the FAQ's right now. But I'm afraid sometime's too, the last time I left my body, I appeared to be in an area that looked like hell, I felt dizzy, hard to breath, and I lost concentration, and the air was burning, not saying that it might've been hell, thats when I woke up, I was back in my body. Yeah, and since then, I did'nt leave my body for awhile. Then the day's became a year, and once i tried re-leaving my body, I was stomped. I felt as though there was a tough bubble surrounding my body, unabbleing me to leave, and then I would return to my body... So I just thought I'd speak of my situation.

Once, you understand that you were in a Focus 2 environment everything will make sense.  In Focus 2 you will realize that thoughts=reality, so if you are scared that you will see a "devil" then you will see this "devil". Your mind can literally create any scenario it wants to in this environment.  This is why Sapphire is always being called a god, because his ego is "manifesting before his eyes". I was scared too for a while because a similar experience as your, and this really stunted my progress.  However, reading Frank's post will REALLY be beneficial to your progress.  He lays the "reality" of Foucus 2 out so it is very understandable, and pretty soon you will laugh at all the previous beliefs of Negs and the such in this environment.
<br>
<br>
For instance, a while back I phased into the RTZ and walked through walls and stuff, and said "I now move inward" (Bulhman style), and indeed I felt movement.  When I felt this movement I thought "I hope my subconscious doesn't think I meant inward into the Earth".  Very quickly I though "I wonder if there are caverns below me".  Sure enough I Phased into a Focus 2 "cavern" environment with a lava river covering most of the floor.  Then, I saw reptilian creatures in the cavern.  I tried to remain cool and unemotional about the whole thing and Phase into Focus 3.  However, one of the Reptilian creatures saw me and was going to attack!  I was amused at this and decided to try something.  So, instead of a light saber I pulled out and empty 5 gallon water tank and started belting him with this thing!  He eventually fell into the lava and died.  Then his lava splash came up and crashed over me.
<br>
<br>
I woke up and thought how funny this episode was, because just the other day I was listening to a radio program at work.  On this program some nut was talking about reptilian aliens living in the earth and stealing human babies to make as slaves!  So, I can see how my mind put this whole scenario together. Rather silly huh? Believe me, I will phase in to a nicer focus 2 environment next time so I can Phase to Focus 3 with out any annoying distractions.

 This is exactly what I meant - he/she sounds like a cult leader, who cares he doesn`t recruit yet.
 <br>
 Sapphire - a cult isn't necessary a completely other religion. Go to a catholic/orthodox priest and tell him you are a God, let's see how he will react.

 Tombo, now i see where you wanna get.
 <br>
 <br>
 about being a buddha, i think that if a buddhist (be it bddha or not) want to help everyome, he can reeicarnate in order to to that.
 <br>
 <br>
 the Dalai Lama for instance, its a reeicarnation of someone that wants to help others..for that reason he still being reincarnating.
 <br>
 <br>
 just my opinion about buddhism and reeincarnation.

 <br>
 sorry for the off topic guys

Thanks Han for your posts, you make a lot of sense.  Helps out a lot...this is all new to me - I've always experienced - and am now starting to understand why/what they really are.
<br>
<br>
I believe we are all children of God - hence the God within ourselves
<br>
<br>
Have no idea what you guys are talking about with that Buddha stuff - just skipping those topics...

  Whether you are immortal or mortal is not up to your decision.  When you die for most of human kinds that unable to Astral Project.  You could still be  immortal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just our souls slipped out sometimes not by will.   Just because we are needed in some where else in other part of universe.

Yes it is not up to me because everyone is "immortal".
<br>
To the rest of your post i won't reply because i can't understand it at all.

All this Buddism or not Buddism and Gods or not Gods is really not my thing. I moved the post to chat so you can argue your respective belief constructs until the sun converts all available hydrogen to helium if that's what you want.
<br>
<br>
I would invite you to consider that we all have the very same subjective energetic structure. So no one can rightfully claim to be any more "enlightened" than any other. We are all created equal and that is how we are. I am no more enlightened than anyone else. The only difference is I have come to teach myself more of an objective knowing of that fact than most people who subscribe to this forum. And that, my friend, is the key to all of this and will be the subject of my next newsletter.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who claims they are some kind of "god", with respect, is just ego tripping on whatever fantasies they have chosen to create within Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

 Putting my Moderator hat on for a moment:
 <br>
 <br>
 It sounds to me like all you are doing is prosletysing buddhism under the guise of trying to teach people about astral projection. Nothing to be ashamed of I suppose. We get people trying this on now and again so most long-standing members here are used to it. But I would respectfully suggest that the affair has run it's course to the extent where it is time to close it all down.

   All right, Frank,
   <br>
   <br>
   You have got what you asked, , I close it all down for you.
   <br>
   <br>
   I come here with peace, but I am being threaten all of time, the feeling is not good.
   <br>
   <br>
   I have removed so called "proselytizing" postings as you asked.

   Humans have their own destiny to follow.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
As you wish, but for the record I did not ask you to actually remove them. I just felt they were not appropriate for OBE Discussions and that was what I meant by closing it down and moving the whole thing to Chat.
<br>
<br>
You talk about coming in peace and about humans having their own destiny like you just stepped out of a UFO. Let's please not forget that we are all part of the human sisterhood and brotherhood on this planet and we each have the very same subjective structure. We are all equal, here (despite all our flaws) so let us please all embrace that and not let petty religious differences come between us.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
