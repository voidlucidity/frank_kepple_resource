anybody try the program? seems to be pretty cool ... it's supposed to clear your chakras and aura, and eliminate emotional issues, even past-life-stuff

and you only use it once every week or so ... pretty expensive, though ...
<br>
<br>
so whatdaya think?

Sounds like it would be cool to try, but juuuust a tad too expensive for me at this point.
<br>
I'm currently using some brainwave-stimulation/meditation CDs from
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.meditatedeeper.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 //www.meditatedeeper.com
</a>
and they seem to work pretty well.
<br>
<br>
Go to the site. Then close it off, and a new window will come up where your can fill out your details and have a free demo tape sent to you.
<br>
However they have an entirely different approach/purpose than the ones you were pointing out.

Yes, regulars will know that I wholeheartedly recommend the Gateway series Wave-1 CD (if your end goal is Astral Projection, that is).
