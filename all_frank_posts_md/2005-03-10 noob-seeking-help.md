Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I have been interested in Astral projection for many years now and have read quite a few books on the subject as have we all in this forum I'm sure.  I have even come close to an OBE on at least two separate occasions, which I shall relate to you all here.
<br>
<br>
The first time I was laying on my bed and trying to project and all of a sudden I felt as if I/ the air around me was vibrating and then I heard a very loud OHM ( like monks chanting ) in time with the vibrations.  Then I felt as if I was extending out from above my head, it felt as if my head was in two places at the same time.  I then got scared and thought I was going to die and I popped back.  The second time was very much the same but instead of going out though the top of my head I felt as if my energy was going out of the front of my body.  Well then I got lazy and quit trying to project for a couple of years and now I'm coming back to it.  So I hope you all can help me out.  Thank you and I look forward to learning from you as well as maybe you learning from me.
