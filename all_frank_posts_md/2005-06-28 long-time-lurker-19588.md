<section>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I thought it was about time I introduced myself.  I've been lurking here for months and have really enjoyed reading everyones different posts.
<br>
<br>
I have been spontaneously OBEing since I was a child,  I have also been known to end up on the inside of someone and looking out through their eyes. I have even witnessed murders that are verifiable. I will explain that part in a post later.
<br>
<br>
I have (fortunately and unfortunately) a basket full of strange and wondrous abilities ranging from OBE's to precognitions to the paranormal.
<br>
<br>
I hope I can contribute some insight to this site as much as I've gotten from it so far!
<br>
<br>

<section>
Hi Hans,
<br>
ap is simply the initials of a name.  Lol...it doesn't mean astral projection or astral pulse.
<br>
<br>
fliesatnite: Your screen name is great!  Says it all.
<br>
(Hopefully we will all be able to do this)

Thank you ap!  Actually that's why I chose that particular name, it's what I do as often as possible! It's one of my favorite past times!
