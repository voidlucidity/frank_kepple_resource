<section>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I had this experience this morning. I remember it having more than this, but I'll pick up at where I remember. I was chatting with a male being named Frank. He had an echo-y sort of voice that I sort of heard but didn't at the same time. When we got done talking, we ended up in a cross between my bedroom and somewhere else; almost like the astral plane superimposed over my room with some areas more opaque than others. Fade to black. I then feel the floating sensations increase as I try to tune (back?) into the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
Next thing I know, I'm in a dark room/area where a big screen is ahead of me, floating in mid-air. I'm reading the words on the screen, (which looks like a web page or computer program) which are very clear but a little hard to focus on. It's a astral projection guide of some sort. (I only wish I could remember what it said!) The whole thing was clear as day. I then try again to shift into the real-time, but keep seeing flashes of fragmented patterns or pictures. I'm still feeling the floating sensation at this point, and I feel like I'm 4 feet above my bed.
<br>
<br>
That's all I remember.
<br>
<br>
Could this be a form of Robert's "virtual reality projection" that he talks about in AD? Perhaps I was thinking about this web site, and then my mind turned it into projection imagery.
<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>
<br>
Jeni

Thank you very much!

could be, however a VR projection into a computer screen could be many leveled! Do you project into the monitor, the program running, the screen saver, what Frank is writing in real time at the moment you project?

No, actually it was just a screen floating in mid-air. I was so close to it that I didn't see the entire thing.
<br>
<br>
The Frank I was talking to was actually conversing with me, not "chatting" in the internet sense. I think he was just a being named Frank. I honestly don't remember what we were talking about (I have the hardest time remembering specific words and details in the astral). I wish I could!

I never thought about the double-coding. Good point!

Does anyone else have any insight into the VR projection thing? Anyone out here have one?
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much,

In the six months of looking at postings here I have not seen much aboutVR projections-maybe you have to be very clear in your subconcious to enter a VR realm and not have subconcious stuff take over- kind of like the problems talked about here with real time verifications- I think that takes an 'expert' projector!

Jeni: It definitely sounds to me like a situation where a guide was trying to get some kind of point across to you. I've recently come across areas in The Library at Focus 27 where there are many screens and all manner of events can be replayed. It seems the idea of replaying events on a screen, therefore, is a typical "guide situation" from what I can gather.
<br>
<br>
About the Astral superimposed on your room this is easily possible but does get more than a little confusing at first. One of the most beneficial parts about Astral Dynamics, for me, was where RB talks at length about "mind split" effects. They used to confuse the heck out of me, but thanks to RB's directions it's something I quickly learned to get used to.
<br>
<br>
Again (and I know it's tricky) you need to try and gather your thoughts, at the time, and try and remain still. Basically, you need to learn to control the situation rather than have it control you.
<br>
<br>
What I do is think of the quality of being still, like still water where there's not a ripple on the surface. Which gets the situation under control. Next, you ask for clarity. If you can't get to grips with what is being shown, take a step back into stillness and ask for clarity again. The moment anything gets confusing, step back right away into that stillness.
<br>
<br>
Because once you learn to keep the situation under control, that's when the fun stuff begins.

Jeni,
<br>
<br>
I agree with Frank on this one.  It sounds like guides are trying to communicate with you through text.  There was a thread posted in the OBE Experiences forum called "Akashic books, hard to read"  that might help you with text remembering.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes,
