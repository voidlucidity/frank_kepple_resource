<section>
My latest 3D blackness adventure occured last night.
<br>
I couldnt get to sleep during the night due to essay work going through my head. So I decided to start focusing on my field of view to try and initiate the 3d blackness effect.
<br>
Well, I got it but then started to drop off. However, this didnt last long as I was brought to full alertness by my moving through the 3d blackness. The more I woke up the faster I got!
<br>
Eventially I was hurtling(!) through the 3d blackness at breakneck speed, funny thing was, I could still feel my hands but they felt like they were gripping onto a rail of some kind, lending the whole thing a kind of rollercoaster effect.. this was FAST!
<br>
<br>
Eventially the 3d blackness 'morphed' into a tunnel through which I was hurtling. After a short while the walls of the tunnel started to become slightly transparant and I could see what looked like stars and galaxies flying past.
<br>
The closest thing I can describe it to is that scene in 'Contact' where Jodie Foster's character Dr Arroway is hurtling through the wormhole, or a similar effect in the movie 'Stargate'.
<br>
<br>
However, as soon as I saw these stars and galaxies flying past, a moment of fear passed through me and the experience ended.
<br>
However, even although the speed I was travelling was terrific I never once thought of any danger, the only twinge of fear I got was when I saw space, as I wondered how far from home I was, this fear then ended the experience.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if I really was hurtling through the galaxy in the RT zone via some kind of wormhole or if the whole thing was an astral construct?
<br>
Either way it was a hell of a lot of fun!
<br>
<br>
So my advice for those that want a bit of a thrill next time they find themselves in the 3D blackness - just try speeding up and see how fast you can go - it's quite an amazing experience!
<br>

PS a note for Frank, I remember you noting at one point that if you imagine pieces of music in this state you get it in 'full suround'
<br>
I certainly had this effect, once or twice pieces of music, other times sound effects or voices (although the voices were just random snippets rather than messages of any kind).

I had a similar experience about a year ago, and it was amazing.  The best way I can explain the tunnel is like in Star Wars or Star Trek when they go to hyperspace, and all you see is specs of light flying past them.  In my experience, I was going through this tunnel and then all of a sudden I was on the other side of the tunnel, still in the blackness.  Then I notices the "stars" (whatever the specs of light are) start moving in a circular motion.  Soon they started to form a sphere and as the sphere was being created, my point of view went from first-person to third person and I saw myself standing in the middle of the sphere.  At this point I was interrupted, and I haven't been able to reproduce the experience so far.  Anyone have any insight on what all this means in the 3d blackness?  It seems that usually when someone finds themself in the 3d blackness and starts experiencing things, they will end up in a focus level or whatever location they are intending to visit.  I didn't end up at any focus levels or anything.

Does anyone know what this blackness is?  I have heard hell being described as an abyss, is it that? Heaven light, Hell the darkness?
<br>
Has anyone seen any entities there or spirits? Has anyone found anything they can't do there yet?

Well I don't believe in Hell, or heaven in the sense that most people think of it, but there has been several theories posted what the 3d blackness is.  Most theories are something like it's just a place to access other places in the astral.  Sort of like a air port or something, although all you have to do is place your intent on where you want to go and you will go there.

<section>
in ad robert talks about these tunnels.  i don't recall which page it's on.  a search on here would show some previous topics discussing the same things.  try searching for tubelike structures.

<section>
Yeah, I agree that the '3d blackness' is part mind and part astral, or rather, its that area where your mind meets the astral. So you can use it as a grand central station to go anywhere!
<br>
<br>
There's nothing scary or evil about it so calling it an 'abyss' or 'hell' is totally wrong IMO. However if someone really believes thats what it is, then thats how they'll see it.
<br>
<br>
As the saying goes, we take heaven and hell with us. So there are plenty of constructed heaven and hells but they are products of our own thought.

I am starting to look at it like the "Big White Area" in the Matrix.  From there anything can be done.  Where the mind goes before a direction is actually taken.  For some it is virtually non-existant because the direction has been chosen from the start.

I was wondering if anyone has found anything that has talked to them in the 3D blackness?  I have seen these golden orbs in there if its the same place and they said, "for me not to kill them".  I have also seen this black jello type substance and when I got closer I saw white light. On another occasion I also saw something that caught me  and was attempting to stabilize me being there and attempted to talk to me but I woke up.

DFL-
<br>
It certainly is possible to encounter others in the 3d blackness state.
<br>
I have'nt done so but I have read of many accounts (inc published NDE accounts) where people come across beings who identify themselves as guides and try to help the individual remain calm and come to terms with what's happening.
<br>
It seems that although the 3d blackness is very much a personal zone in that it is where YOUR mind meets the astral, it is indeed possible for others to turn up there and asist you, or just observe.

Yes, it *is* one heck of a lot of fun! Though not an experience for the squeamish.
<br>
<br>
Obviously, I can't say for sure but it does sound to me like you were hurtling through the RT zone. One Astral difficulty is caused by the fact that we tend to move about the Astral using the same degree of effort that we use when moving about the Physical. Problem is, it takes no effort at all really to "move" either within the Astral or the RT zone.
<br>
<br>
You probably set-off with the intention of mentally stepping-into the 3D-blackness and perhaps used much more mental effort than was necessary. With the effect you ended up shooting-off somewhere.
<br>
<br>
That feeling of speed is just great isn't it? Many times I've entered RT-zone tube structures: which is what I think you inadvertently entered as you describe it so rightly, i.e.
<i>
 "After a short while the walls of the tunnel started to become slightly transparant and I could see what looked like stars and galaxies flying past"
</i>
. This is like how it appears to me too. And I've many times shot down these tubes or tunnels at speeds which feel like thousands and thousands of MPH.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what these structures are, exactly, but they seem to be huge kinds of links between points in space. These tube structures have all manner of interconnections too. If you can keep your protective sense of awareness calm, while in the midst of it all, you can find yourself suddenly switching direction down another tunnel.
<br>
<br>
But do be wary as some of them can be one *heck* of a roller-coaster ride. I once entered a tube structure and got gripped by a force of energy that shot me off somewhere and, despite all my experience, I really thought I'd overcooked it this time and would never get free.
<br>
<br>
I was hurtling through some kind of energy vortex at breakneck speed for what seemed like an age, and it wasn't stopping. My protective sense of awareness was hitting panic-button after panic-button in an attempt to zap back to Physical, but nothing was working. Eventually I did get back, of course, and I chuckle about it now. But, at the time, I really and truly thought I'd had it.
<br>
<br>
Once you can "exit" with a bit more control these structures can be perceived quite readily. Together with all manner of grid and Entrance structures. The grid-structures look like very fine laser light-beams that literally form a 3-dimensional grid structure. The ones I seem to always end up travelling through are mainly red and blue in colour. The size of each of the cubes that form the whole grid look to be about 50cm square (though the size and colour can vary sometimes).
<br>
<br>
Within the structure of the grid are energy pathways that you can travel through. They come about just after stepping into the 3D-blackness. If you mentally hold a picture of a grid formation this should open up an energy pathway for you at the appropriate place. You can also use this technique in order to perceive Astral Plane Entrance structures, of the kind portrayed on the back cover of Astral Dynamics.

Yes, it is possible to just float in the 3D-Blackness listening to a favourite piece of music, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
At this Focus 21 state you are in a kind of Astral no-man's land between the Physical and the Astral. Hence why F21 is termed a Bridge-Zone. Here you are right on the brink of the realms where thought-equals-direct-action. So all you need do to experience something, is to think about experiencing whatever that something is, and... zoom... it instantly comes about.

Thanks for your input Frank.
<br>
I find these tube structures and other forms of gateways really intriguing, in fact I've really got the urge to explore them further, however this will involve getting more adept at getting to the 3d blackness state first, as I feel I need more practice in this area.
