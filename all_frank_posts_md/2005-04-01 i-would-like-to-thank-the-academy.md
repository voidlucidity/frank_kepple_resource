<section>
I would like to thank the whole forum, and give a extra big shout out to major tom and frank for helping me understand phasing and focus levels mo betta!  I have had many accidental obe's and countless LD's, but I think coming here and meeting all of you and reading all the articles, along with beginning NEW (only 2 days worth) allowed me one of the most liberating experiences of my life.  I would like to share it with all of you, even though I believe all of it but about the first 2 minutes was outside of the RTZ, maybe more of a WILD.
<br>
<br>
I was laying on my side, curled up (which I have never projected from this position before) relaxing, when I started to have the breathing problems I normally have, where I feel like my breathing just stops. I fought through it, but not by resisting it, but by letting my body do what it had to do which I haven't tried before.  I started breathing again, but my out breaths where so deep and staggered into pushes of 3.  It is a hard sensation to explain, but as soon as I let go and let my body do what it had to do, I felt light, i felt my legs lifting and vibrations coursed through me.  I didn't get excited, i just smiled the biggest smile of my life and went with it.
<br>
<br>
I found myself laying on the floor of my room.  I have a very cluttered floor, game consoles, empty propel bottles, weights, etc. but none of it was there.  I kept my eyes closed and thought I just fell out of my bed, felt around and found my floor bare and refreshingly cool and comforting to feel.  I opened my eyes, but I opened my physical eyes by accident, and I was paralyzed in bed, looking into my closet.  I thought "oh god, i finally did it, and now I messed up" but I just closed my eyes and was back on my floor.
<br>
<br>
I stood, sort of... more of a floating up into a standing position and I was suddenly a point of consciousness on my bed.  I was overjoyed!  I looked up at my sub woofer which is right behind my bed, on top of the box it came in, and there was a note on it.  It said in huge letters F*** YOU!
<br>
I started laughing uproariously and took it off and looked at it.  As soon as I touched it I felt overcome by a feeling that the note was meant in a hardy, whimsical fashion, and as i tilted it, signatures and quotes began materializing on it.  I struggled so hard to read them but they looked really blurry.  All I can remember about it is that one of the signatures was accompanied by a poem, but I couldn't read it and it said "infamous last words of" and had a name I also couldn't read.  I also noticed a logo of what looked like a pacman ghost with its tongue out at me.  I feel after thinking about this for a while that this was a note from all the negative entities that had tried to stop me in the past, and felt relief like none other.
<br>
I think this is where I went out of the RTZ.
<br>
<br>
Just as I put it down and started floating I saw a green block fall, and it turned into 3 army men, dressed like ww1 soldiers.  They saw me and fled in what I sensed to be awe and fear.  I said "is someone there?  don't be afraid, I am so happy to see you!  (at this point i realized I sounded like I had inhaled helium and smirked) I am from another world!" and what I felt to be their superior officer came back around the corner and looked up at me and smiled a grin of sheer wonder.  I felt that he wanted to stay but had to go somewhere vitally important, and that he was not intelligent enough to communicate with me beyond instinctual feelings.
<br>
<br>
At this point i wanted to leave my room but I saw a full length mirror where my door should have been.  I freaked out because I read that if I looked into a mirror I could be sucked into an anomalous world, and I didn't want to leave my house.  I turned away and felt my energy leaving me as I woke peacefully and fully refreshed.
<br>
<br>
Again, thank you ALL SO MUCH.  continue helping others and may they be as grateful as me.
<br>
<br>

Thanks again guys, I typed that up right after it happened, and my whole day was excellent!  I sort of had a buzz going and couldn't stop smiling all day!  To bad it is kind of depressing to have to go to work right after having no limitations and transcending reality as almost everyone out there knows it.  I cant wait to get out of my house!!!  I haven't even left my room while out, I have while lucid dreaming, but then i usually start somewhere random.  One more thing I forgot to mention is that I built a VPR box (see my other post) and the darned thing wasn't even there when I projected!!!!!!!  As soon as I got out I looked all over for it in my room but it was gone!!!!!!!  D'OH! Do you guys think that the army men where actual entities or just something from my subconscious?  I hope they actually live in my room, they rule!  Maybe they are astral larvae of some kind?  I didn't create them mentally, in fact they actually scared me at first.  Out of no where this block of green stuff materializes and I could feel its life force, I knew it was living, and it started to move.  I thought "oh god what kind of crazy blob of an entity did I attract???"
<br>
<br>
I was also thinking about whether it would be possible for entities to learn projection into the physical.  If they where smart enough, could they learn to phase into the physical like we can phase into the astral?   I wouldn't blame them for just frankly not wanting to, but I find it an interesting thought.
<br>
<br>
TOM YOUR THE MAN!!!! I really think your advice about letting my breathing just do what it had to do and consider it a process really helped.  I tried just letting my body breath on its own again but it is very distracting and hard not to think "I cant breath" which probably kept me from breathing.  Now I have gone over that obstacle thanks to your advice and one doozy of a roadblock has been cleared.

Next time don't be afraid to look in the mirror.  Mirror's are great fun.  I always look in mirror's because I have no idea what I'm going to see!  It's usually a fascinating experience.....

I will have to try that. THanks cat.  Just as an update my most recent experience was a lucid dream of meeting penelope cruz, doing huge lines of coke with her and going to some concert.  It was awesome.

<br>
Anyone know of any side effects of astral drugs? do they effect the astral body like they do the physical?  I really over did it, i mean I knew i was dreaming so I just shoved my face in it and filled my head up practically.  Felt amazing, never done it irl, but I'm guessing the feeling was close.
<br>
<br>
Also, Tom, I had a LD involving your avatar.  I was in a library with 4 other entities and they where all very rude and started fighting amongst themselves, I jumped up on top of the book cases to get out of the way and I looked up in the rafters and you where hanging out up there watching!  I didnt really realize it at the time but now that I came on here and looked at your av, it was totally that guy!  You spying on me?

*Smacks head fiercely...* Naw duh! Sherlock...
<br>
<br>
Anyway... I might have an explanation to your entities...
<br>
<br>
Ghosts and spirits can take on complexions that are physically impossible, like a three headed chicken or a one eyed bacteria... It's all a matter on the emotional and will like energies the ghosts carries...
<br>
<br>
Also... Your complexion can change if you adjust you spirit right... For instance, try listening to your favorite song while OBEing, or whatever, your complexion will change by the emotions you carry...
<br>
<br>
One last thing... It is said all humans have a guardian like entity that follows with them as they live (And maybe after)... Mine is a large golden Shelong (In Chinese, it means "God Dragon". Like that big dragon thing that comes out of the Dragon Balls in DBZ...)
<br>
<br>
Finding your spirit beast may be another key factor in your journey... Maybe that's why the green blob follows you around...
<br>
<br>
And another thing... Spirits can't project into the physical plane... Mainly because they exist sole in the spiritual spectrum than the physical spectrum... (No Bodies...)
<br>
<br>
Thanks again... And keep in touch!
