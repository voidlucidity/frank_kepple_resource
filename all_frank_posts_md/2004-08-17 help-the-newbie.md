Hello all, i'm been browsing the forums for quite some time, but I just recently decided to try all this AP stuff. Hope this is the right forum. Anyway, i've been trying to AP from dreams considering that would be the easiest method for me. I tried almost all the other methods on this forum, except maybe the N.E.W. thing, but when I tried the Brainsync thing, with the help of a crack [}:)], I kinda fell asleep and had a realistic dream that felt as if I was watching it. I mean I knew I was dreaming, but was watching the dream and still having the same feelings. For instance, I was running away from someone with a sword(don't ask if it was the lady from Cradle to the Grave[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]) and I felt an intense fear like no fear i've ever fealt before, and me being a controlled person with my emotions, this was weird for me. I mean I saw the sword before I decided to run away and chose to run -.- So, after running to some woods, a man ran in front of me across my view. Naturally I was thinking to run, but for some reason I stopped for a second and took note of him. That's where the dream ended and I woke up with a terrible headache. That's why I say dreams would probably be best for me though. The problem with that is, I either don't have dreams, or can't remember them every night. Kinda getting annoying now -.- So, does anyone have any advice that might help?

Meditation, using NEW and keeping a dream journal should help...also exercising will help boost your skills. [

I am new to all of this.  I joined the forum because it seemed most suited for my experiences.  Let me explain, if I can.  I have several different 'things' that I find rather baffling.  First, I have an uncanny ability to describe detailed scenarios of future (and past, at times) events surrounding myself and family.  I usually say "I'll bet you ....." or "What if ...." and then go through a very detailed and complex iteration of events.  Someimes the events are so 'unlikely' that I get brushed off, yet each and every time I do this, the events have unfolded 'exactly' as I had said in my scenario.  Next, I have very very frequent deja vu (I think).  That is, there are numerous and frequent occassions that I 'know I have been here' or more frequently it is in the form of suddenly realizing that I have already experienced (seen, heard, lived) the events, conversations, etc. happening and know what is going to be said, done next.  I have even answered the questions that had not yet been asked, yet I knew they were going to be, or retrieved an item that someone had not yet asked for, but I knew they were going to.  I simply say each and evey time, "I dreamed this."  Yet, I have no recollection of these dreams and I typically have extremely vivid, detailed complex dreams and can typically remeber them very well.  Next, my dreams.  As stated, they are very vivid, detailed, but never fantasy-like.  I mean I dream real life situation.  I rarely (actually I can count maybe 4-5 times in my life) where I dreamed something that appeared more symbolic than anything.  I never have drems that unrealistic things occur, appear or happen.  Never anything great, like being a fairy princess or having huge amounts of money.  Just simply long and real type dreams.  The most odd part is that I know I am dreaming every time and can manipulate my dreams to the logical scenario (if that makes sense to anyone).  I mean, that I feel as though I am looking either through a scope or as though a 'fly on the wall' and I purposely turn to see things and discover things or witness events, etc.  I never see myself in any dreams, either I am (or feel first person) or more times than not I am not even a party in the dream at all.  Finally, I have a wierd 'quirk'.  When I close my eyes, either before sleep or just for rest, I see images.  That is, it takes a few seconds then a face will form.  Most of the times it is a waist up view of a person that I have no idea who they are.  Never saw the person before, yet I have a vivid picture of them 'live-picture'.  They appear to be alive, yet just the detailed image of the person.  Also, recently during these unexplained stranger images, I see short views of the person doing stuff.  It appears like a short video clip almost.  Then it fades.  I can concentrate and draw the person back into view, but then they fade again.  Keep in mind I am fully awake, it happens within seconds after closing my eyes.  One more thing that is probably the most disturbing to me.  An event that happened just a few weeks agao.  I wa dreaming that I was reading a police report surrounding something that has occurred around my family.  I again knew I was dreaming and was manipulating this document so that I could vividly read the text.  The phone rang and woke me, it was my mother.  I was awake and immediately told her to get a copy of this document, but the creepy thing was that even though I was awake and talking to her and had my eyes open, the document was clear in front of me and was reading top her the text that I was seeing.  I could not stop the image and continued to read verbatim from this document.  I was very scared and my mother seemed very anxious for me to continue reading.  It disappeared after I shook it off, but that was after about five full minutes of awake reading of this text.  Now, until recently family, friends and myself have pawned this off as 'high intelligence', however, I have had testing and my IQ is not extraoridinary, although in the "high-average to superior" range in complex problem solving, memory area.  I have always thought I had 'good intuition and instinct'  many times cannot understand why the scenario doesn't smack everyone else in the face as it does me.  My mother has recently said that I have strong psychic ability.  I have no idea what, if anything, all of this means.

<br>
Can anyone relate to any of this at all.  It has become so frequent that its bothersome.
<br>
<br>
Any comments?

You should take that "frequentness" as a gift because they are chances for you to examine your skills and what not so that so may have better control and so that it WONT be bothersome anymore.

Milakel: Like your mother says you are psychic. I just wish I had been born with the same ability. What you are calling "bothersome" people are busting a gut for decades to attain. Just roll with it and be happy.
