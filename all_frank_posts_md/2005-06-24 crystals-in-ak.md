<section>
Spirits and crystals and UFOs
<br>
So many mysteries nobody knows.
<br>
I went to dig crystals in Arkansas
<br>
And boy was I filled with awe.
<br>
We beat on drums, told stories and sang
<br>
And the voices of angels rang.
<br>
Women from Venus and men from Mars,
<br>
Sweat Lodges and seminars.
<br>
Devas and faeries and sprites and elves
<br>
Got us in touch with our higher Selves.
<br>
Buddha and Christ, Zoroaster and Ra
<br>
All were with us in Arkansas.
<br>
Totems of Eagle and Wolf and Flea
<br>
Great Spirit spoke through them to me.
<br>
Spirits of Chigger and Fly and Tick
<br>
Lyme Disease is only Karmic.
<br>
Angels and faeries and UFOs,
<br>
I saw them all and I'm thrilled to my toes.
<br>
Spirits and crystals, I'm so elated
<br>
'Cause everything is interrelated
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pouring my heart out,
<br>
Han
