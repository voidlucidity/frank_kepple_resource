<section>
I am sure you have all heard about 2012 and whatever else. I am reading a book called the Orion Prophecy, and its got me thinking.
<br>
I know, and have always beleived that a major event will happen, in this year. I did not know that untill recently, what that "event" will be.
<br>
A Geomagnetic Pole reversal. The earth will spin the other way, and the poles will switch (north becoms south. . .) It will be set off by massive solar flares that will rip though our atmosphere, and cause the reversal.
<br>
I was sceptical at first, but the more research i do, the most the peices seem to fit.
<br>
This cataclysm has happened before. it happens every some 27 thousand years. (not an exact #) This happened in the time of Horus, Set, and the like. I have read first hand of the tales as they unfolded in the forth told "Mathmatical Celestial Combonations"
<br>
They knew it was comming. The Ancient Egyptions knew about it as well as the Maya.
<br>
I was just curious about what you all thought about this paticular subject.

IMO...nonsense.
<br>
<br>
This topic has been talked to death..now I just wish it would die and go away.  If something happens fine, if nothing happens..fine.  To spend another second wondering about it is a waste of time.
<br>
<br>
With the risk of being attacked by the younger folk, I have to say this seems to be something one thinks about while in the younger years of life... ya know, mortality and all..the fear of your own death, the fear of the unknown, or just seeking out something that will give you an adrinaline rush.

I agree with Nay and Gandalf. Too many people simply took this 2012 stuff to bring out their own prophecies and what not. Maybe I should write a book with the keywords "mayan calendar", "2012", "demon war", "good vs evil", "poleshift" etc., and earn some money.
<br>

But for the sake of the question: I'll either be at home (in my own home by then, most certainly) doing something, or at work doing something.

I'll be on CNN doing an interview about winning Randi's challenge, after it went to court. I'll be saying that it's time for humanity to throw down the shackles that have held us back all the long. Whackos from both sides will conjecture that I am the antichrist or the second coming.

Teomim,
<br>
<br>
I have also read about 2012, and quite frankly, I do believe something is going to happen.  As for the pole shift...  I am not sure if that is (to be?) a litteral occurence.  I do feel, however, that 2012 is the approximate date that which the vibrational "prison" we humans have been locked in will be broken.  Meaning that by then, enough people will have "awoken" and stepped into their full power as creative beings.  Now, whether natural catyclismic disasters will happen... could be.   I wouldn't doubt it.
<br>
<br>
I understand why other people scoff and discredit "another doomsday prediction" -- but I feel that the 2012 date is different.   Think about it... the Mayan's have supposedly been amazingly accurate with their natural calculations.  I would be hard-pressed to believe that they chose just an ARBITRARY stop date for their calendar.  Also, many researchers from various diciplines, not just "young, adreniline-junkies", have put forward well-constructed theories, supported by facts and reasonable connections.    ... Why all this attention to the date 2012, if it were arbitrary?
<br>
<br>
Also, perhaps the increase (or at least seeming increase) of doomsday predictions (i.e. Y2k, Heaven's Gate, or whatever) was just the result of more and more people waking up to their sense that SOMETHING is coming...  perhaps this energy is felt, but out of a mixture of confusion, wishful thinking, etc., people f-ed up on the exact date.
<br>
<br>
I am rather surprized that all the responses you got you so far Teomim have been so one-sided.  ?

I believe it's always good to have an open mind. I neither believe or scoff at predictions such as these. I think the reactions have been so one-sided because people have become a bit (a lot) jaded. In a sense, I guess it's to be expected. Living it this world, you tend to receive a lot of useless, ignorant, and/or inaccurate information. Whatever the year though, it does seem to be the nature of the Earth to erupt in some major cataclysm from time to time. It's BOUND to happen again, I believe... just a matter of when.

Ha ha, and every time they say, "But this time it's different". These kinds of things have me falling off my chair laughing. I mean, if that's what someone chooses to believe then whatever floats their boat. It's one of the tamer constructs and far less damaging than firing missiles at people, for example, or clubbing innocent creatures to death.
<br>
<br>
Low on factual accuracy, but
<u>
 high
</u>
on chuckle value, so keep 'em coming is what I say!
<br>
<br>
Personally, I cannot wait to hear all the excuses. I'm never one to say, "I told you so" but this time I'm going to make the exception that proves the rule. I'll be there on January 1st, 2013 laughing my socks off. I really like being older. You see the same things coming around time and again with each new generation, and each one sees it all afresh and thinks they invented it.
<br>
<br>
To everyone who subscribes to the 2012, whatever it is, Doom and Gloom, could I ask you to please check and make sure you got your dates correct?
<br>
<br>
The number one all-time excuse with this kind of thing is, "Sorry, we were right but we just got the date wrong." Of course, and my dad was an astronaut, the cheque is in the post, and the moon really is made from Swiss cheese.

<section>
I'm sorry but there is a difference between open mind and a "true believer". It's a passion of the human race, maybe because of death or other issues, that we have to have prophecies.  What's amazing is that when seeming solid prophecies don't happen that the believer's are amazing at ducking what didn't happen and STILL believe.  I personally don't believe as such.  I work "energy" work as per Robert Bruce's NEW and chi kung because I personally can feel it, reproduce it regularly and do stuff with it for myself.  If something requires faith alone I ignore it-I don't believe or disbelieve, as either way too much mental energy is required.
<br>
^ This statement applies to things like AP, OOBE, afterlife, God(s), spirits etc. Yes it's interesting to talk about but believing OR being closed are not that useful. If I'd experienced spirits, and other things then I'd not need belief-though I'd have an opinion about what I experienced.
<br>
This 2012 stuff sounds and feels like yet more NEW age nonsense to me. I for one am sick to death of "Yoghurt weavers", prediciting this/that/the other, talking of new age coming and other stuff. Long windy passages said to be channelled etc.  To me any real exploration needs to be from within.
<br>
So yes, people can definitly pick apart what I say in different ways. But I'm a skeptic to all blind belief, and that kind of nonsense. I'm a great "believer" in DIY. If the New Age stuff being published (and profited by in many cases) was that important-we'd all be getting in our dreams, in our lives and it would be pitched so that each individual could follow it.
<br>
It's not. I've nailed my colours to the mast with this post-I don't go for the wishy washy misty tinkly stuff at all. I go for real experience, that's what I respond to. Anyone can say anything with sufficient thought, time and motivation. It doesn't mean it's real.
<br>
And damn I did it again, I rambled.
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line-unless there's some way to solidly prove prediction (HOW!!!) without just using yet more channelled stuff-I don't think it has any reality.

.
<br>
<br>
P.S there's a reason i'm a little vitriolic. For several years a lady who I thought was a very dear friend had me going along with her on this stuff-she even had me believing I was meant to be one of the "technical team" to help the planet through this time and help work out space folding and other stuff.
<br>
yes, I was seriously naive and dumbass and wanted something to hang onto. It took me a few years to regain my independent critical thinking.  I stopped short of closed minded skeptism last year due to the fact I could STILL move chi-an ability I'd had since I was small.

Hi All,
<br>
Allowances should be made for newcomers who want to search out this topic, and so there really is no room for jaded-ness from the Team.  IMHO
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Scientifically, we know the earth does undergo massive upheavals about every 26 to 30 million years, and it does so as a matter of course during it's immense cycles and movements.
<br>
<br>
We also know that the last such event was about 32 million years ago..  therefore it is overdue in Planetary terms.
<br>
<br>
And we know the Mayan calender was designed to record extremely large time spans for the Earth and it's Cycles, as well as recording the timing of other natural events over lesser periods.
<br>
<br>
Since many cultures kept track of the movement of planets, stars and other travellers in space, we also know that they recorded these same time spans and events.
<br>
<br>
Those cultures who lived in connection with the planet instead of trampling it like second-hand carpet, had racial memories of the same events and time spans.
<br>
<br>
And we sit here in judgment about something we really know little about !!
<br>
<br>
For some years I've been watching the earthquake activity of this planet, expecting to see a steady growth of frequency and magnitude, according to the visions that I was unfortunate to have been gifted with, of the years from 2004 up into 2012 and continuing to 3000.  I was not so surprised to find that this growth was actually happening, just as I had been shown it would.
<br>
<br>
Added to this is the weight of scientific observations made of every aspect of this planet, including the sudden change in gravity direction flow back in 1998, the sudden massive growth in understanding that this Solar system of ours actually does descend into more dense regions of the Galaxy about every 30 million years... coinciding with the highest extinction level events on record.
<br>
<br>
These few past years I have seen so much of the visions become reality in this world, that I tend to think the visions were showing me the probable future for this little planet.
<br>
<br>
2012 was shown to me as a massive year of upheavals on a worldwide scale..  and it is survivable by a much reduced population.  From there we can build anew, and hopefully we will choose to do everything differently in the next ages.  I am excited at the prospect of being able to help steer that initial effort.
<br>
<br>
In summary, LOL...  As naturally as humans eating and breathing, this planet will have to undergo change as a part of it's own evolution...  this it has done many times in it's long life.  Exactly what the events will be and what other parts of the visions come to be reality, will only be known if and when it does happen.
<br>
<br>
Until then, live life like there is no tomorrow, because tomorrow may not come for some of us.

<section>
Teomim,
<br>
<br>
I liked the "Subject" of your post: "Where will you be . . .?"
<br>
<br>
I don't know if we're going to have a poll shift.  I don't know if aliens are coming or an asteroid is going to hit the earth or if we as a species are just going to dumb ourselves into a hole we can't technology or spend our way out of.
<br>
<br>
Maybe nothing is coming, altho I think that's such a long shot as to be astronomically remote.
<br>
<br>
I'm not familiar with your Orion book but the thing I like about prophecy and the people who write about them, is that it's a tool to bring me up short and to check in with myself and the world and see if I'm living the life I need to live to get where I need to be.
<br>
<br>
I like that prophesy and it's translators are little reminders that the humnan patterns to which I've become accustomed and that seem so solid are ephemeral viewed through a longer lens.
<br>
<br>
By 2010 (well before 2012) I intend to be living in a community of people not bracketed by the status quo, people who view change -- even radical change to the point of death with a sense of curiousity and adventure.  I want a group of people who are honest about their needs and gifts plus aware of how those exist in balance with the needs and gifts of the world around them -- including but not limited to other people.
<br>
<br>
In 2010 and 2012 I hope to be living generally where I am right now -- simply because this general areas FEEL like the right place for me to be -- but I'm not locked into that concept.  Life is full of ebb and flow and if I need to be physically elsewhere, I hope to be attentive enough to make that alteration with grace.
<br>
<br>
Why 2010?  Dunno.  I used to be focused on 2003 and it's too late for that now!  I suspect that part of it is that I would like to have my 2010 goal RIGHT NOW even though right now I'm probably not mature enough to fit into that kind of community.  2010 gives me room to work, living my life moment by moment and shaping myself and the world around me with that goal in mind.
<br>
<br>
A number of people in my current extended community are focused on books and writings like the Orion book you have read.  Personally, I think these are a tool for their unconscious mind to get their linear mind on board with the life changes their higher self wants them to make.  It give the linear mind something to think about and frees them up to change their lives in ways that would just seem CRAZY without a context.  But that's just the view from the "cheap seats"  since I'm just an observer.
<br>
<br>
These distant prophecy writings just don't resonate for me.  That's okay, professional sports on tv don't resonate for me either and I KNOW they have a valuable context for lots of people.
<br>
<br>
Prophecy and posts like your automatically send me off checking to see where I am in my approach to all this.
<br>
<br>
My life has been full of radical shifts and changes.  Without intuition, my intellect believe as it looks at the world radical changes are going to be the order of the day for my lifetime.
<br>
<br>
I want to be a healthy aspect of the choices that come today, and healthier still tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and well before 2010,  and I WANT MY GOATS BACK.  That has nothing to do with prophecy, I just miss my herd of little weed eating geniuses.

This planet for thousand upon thousands of years has been having cataclismic activity.  The only reason why we've been noticing these things in the last oh.. lets say a hundred years (perhaps Joya can help out with that number, cause I never claimed to know it all) is because of the introduction of the mail delivery, telegraph, phone, then the computer.

Each to their own i guess... but it does get scary when you realise the extent to which these people believe this and indeed 'look forward' to it...
<br>
<br>
btw the 'evidence' is not very convincing: the reason more 'catacalysms' seem to occur nowadays is because they are more widely reported now due to advances in communication technology; the 'evidence' that everyone seems to have had 'insights' on the run up to 2000 and thereabouts is more due to ingrained fixations with Christian apocalyptic mythology than reality; this apocalyptic mythology has been merged which much ill quoted and mistranslated Mayan writings to produce predictable results (pardon the pun).
<br>
<br>
As I've said before, a desire for some kind of catacalysm or sudden change is due to people being deeply unhappy about aspects of their own lives or their perception of the world..
<br>
The good news is that change CAN occur, but true change comes from within, not without... Change yourself and the sky's the limit (actually its not

hmmm... tried to post this earlier, but it didn't go through... trying it again...
<br>
<br>
You know, I do not appreciate (Frank and others) labeling people with different ideas as "younger" and therefore implying that WISDOM comes with age.  It seems that I see the same people posting their "I know better than you" or "you only believe this because you are young" opinions over and over.
<br>
<br>
So, to those who have said they have seen this sort of thing (prediction dates missed)... would you be so kind to provide specific examples?
<br>
<br>
I am a highly aware, highly intelligent (hehe, and not too-modest) 28  year old.  I have done the whole "new agey" thing -- and I too have been duped by sprititual preditors, who pretty much "raped" me on almost all levels (spiritually, psychologically, and most of all financially).  Yet, I have come through that time of exploration and learning even stronger and more intact.  I respect myself for still having the ability to mix reason with an open-mind, and to not be bitter or shattered by these experiences.  I consider myself WISE, despite the fact that I may be younger then some others here.
<br>
<br>
I do not push my beliefs on others, but I do offer my thoughts.  I try to do this in a non-offensive, non-namecalling way.  I would appreciate if others would do the same.    Would YOU like to post your ideas, in the nature of sharing, only to be called OLD and ridiculed???

Hey Nay,

<br>
I totally agree that earthquakes and other natural "disasters" have been going on for as long as there is time.
<br>

Hell they're only "disasters" from a human point of view.  From a geologic point of view they're just part of the daily bump and grind -- the planet brushing it's teeth and going about it's geological day.
<br>
<br>
Where I find "wake up calls" useful -- independant of whether or not their "clock" is set accurately or the specific alarm is the right one -- is in the reminder of just how deeply imbedded I am in the mass hypnosis that is human culture.
<br>
<br>
Natural "disasters" have greater effect right now from a human perspective because of the way we have populated and built up structures and moved from a distributed economics into specialization of skills and even regions.  That matters because the emotional and strategic thinking that comes along with the natural adjustments shift suddently -- and the various nearly instant communication techniques can sweep that emotional thinking around the world before the stabilization of time and perspective can do it's thing.
<br>
<br>
That quick sweep can add to that the manufactured disasters we create and their consequences.
<br>
<br>
I have a friend who likes to chuckle and remind me that there's an old Chinese curse that goes:  May you live in Interesting Times.
<br>
<br>
My personal goal is to grow to the point I can revel in Interesting Times without losing my sense of mundane and the personal.

The egyptions knew of this comming event, the last time it happened. They took years and years of preperations, building Mandjits (boats reputed to be unsinkable), food and water for everyone. At this time was a war, and most of the ships were destryoed, as the war raged on, the cataclysm, started, and the people fled in a terrible panic, while the earth convulsed, spurted lava, ash, and doom fell from the sky's.

I just think it's important to consider, even if 1,000 of these prophecies come and go and never amount to anything... only ONE needs to be right.
<br>
I agree with you when you say, things like this are important in that they give you a bit more motivation to examine your life. Regardless of if they're true or not, it does make you think. Of course, it can also back-fire, when people become immune to all of it.

 You know, I do not appreciate (Frank and others) labeling people with different ideas as "younger" and therefore implying that WISDOM comes with age.  It seems that I see the same people posting their "I know better than you" or "you only believe this because you are young" opinions over and over.
 <br>
 <br>
 So, to those who have said they have seen this sort of thing (prediction dates missed)... would you be so kind to provide specific examples?
 <br>
 <br>
 I am a highly aware, highly intelligent (hehe, and not too-modest) 28  year old.  I have done the whole "new agey" thing -- and I too have been duped by sprititual preditors, who pretty much "raped" me on almost all levels (spiritually, psychologically, and most of all financially).  Yet, I have come through that time of exploration and learning even stronger and more intact.  I respect myself for still having the ability to mix reason with an open-mind, and to not be bitter or shattered by these experiences.  I consider myself WISE, despite the fact that I may be younger then some others here.
 <br>
 <br>
 I do not push my beliefs on others, but I do offer my thoughts.  I try to do this in a non-offensive, non-namecalling way.  I would appreciate if others would do the same.    Would YOU like to post your ideas, in the nature of sharing, only to be called OLD and ridiculed???

I don't think people are stupid.
<br>
<br>
I think "what you focus on determines what you miss" and our cultural world is so complex and intense that there is simply TOO MUCH INFORMATION of all kinds available.
<br>
<br>
As a byproduct of systems design, we respond naturally to mirroring -- it was part our earliest learning about how to learn.
<br>
<br>
Groups protect themselves from cohesion destroying interpersonal chaos by silently agreeing what information will be acceptable and what will -- by mutual unconscious agreement -- be ignored and relegated to "false or trivial"  There's aggressive policing of those rules within any functioning group for the simple reason that addressing EVERY piece of info with equal regard creates a tower of babel effect.
<br>
<br>
What happens over generations of time is that human intepersonal cues and standards actually become more important than tracking the Big Real -- and individuals who grow to majority in those cultures increasingly lack the very tools to even
<i>
 experience
</i>
the Real.  (I'm talking very much about myself here.)
<br>
<br>
Individuals NOT in tune with the subtle unwritten rules find themselves unable to interact with the culture and the group and are marginalized to the point of not being heard.
<br>
<br>
I think (read those two words softly because this is an area where I am significantly uncertain instead of my usual level of basic bewilderment) Ahem.  I
<i>
 think
</i>
there's something in much of this stuff that sounds like nonsense that speaks to the wise intuitive parts of all of us -- but is the right message in the right time and the right place for
<i>
 some
</i>
people to come into a different and better level of balance between their human interpersonal cultural selves and the larger reality.
<br>
<br>
I think of them as contemporary mythology, struggling to translate something real and important but not quite being able to fit it into words.
<br>
<br>
Or, as Mel Brooks said in 2000 Year Old Man:  THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN PHIL!

<section>
Ok this is my first post, but I consider myself an expert on 2012 in many ways.  2012 is not in anyway a doomsday period, it is a new begin and accession into a higher dimension for most of us.  It is not just the Mayans that predicted this date but many many different cultures and people of great wisdom.
<br>
<br>
If you take a moment yourself and start to do the research you will see all of the 2012 information cross referencing itself about what is going to transpire. You will have to come to a conclusion in your own right.
<br>
<br>
Even the Time travelers at Montauk could not break the barrier of 2012 and 2013.
<br>
<br>
I myself have tried to see the years and only find it thick and heavy, that is the only way I can describe those years.  Kind of like something is trying to keep everyone from seeing it.  I have spoken with many people with abilities like mine own and they appear to be getting the same results.
<br>
<br>
I will give you all a great link to start the research on 2012, because I can assure you it is of great significance for us all.
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/link.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/link.htm
</a>
<br>
<br>
I believe this date is so significant that I am in the process of constructing a site/forum just for 2012 talk.   This site will be up in about a month and it will be free.
<br>
<br>
Before people start to slam this date I would suggest to do your research and then you can make an intelligent comment that contains some wisdom, I think most will find the link I provided a great start.
<br>
<br>
Again there is nothing to worry about 2012, this will be a wonderful transformation for all of us.

There are many hard core facts about what is transpiring it started about 1987 and has been going on for quite some time.  Your not going to learn this in a basic Earth Science class.
<br>
<br>
You just need to look around you Weather, Wars, and Chaos.  Why do you need someone or something to valid the inner senses you already have.
<br>
<br>
But if you need more........
<br>
<br>
Schumann's resonance 7.83 Hz increasing (Earth's pulse) for instance it has been at a constant for thousands of years until 1987 where it has dramatically increased to about 11 Hz+ right now.  This is fact and can be quantified.

Hi RT,
<br>
Thank you for the links you provided.  As president of a research group where I live, I received the information about the increase in Schumann's Resonance, which I found affirmed the observations some of us were making.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, the birthing into the next age cannot occur with a sigh or joyous smile for one important reason.  People on this planet have been working what I call 'the Might is Right mindset', and as with all things, it has to reach it's own conclusion BEFORE the step into the next age.
<br>
<br>
So, what is happening in the world around us must grow to it's inevitable ending, before anything will change, although there is also the beginnings of the new within the dying of the old.
<br>
<br>
In this respect, the 2012 birthing into the new age will be like any birth, wracked with pain before it settles down again.
<br>
<br>
I have no reason to explain why Montauk viewers were unable to see into that time-frame, while the group I experienced viewing with were able to clearly get deep insight and clear 'seeing'.
<br>
<br>
And to date, my seeing has always been extremely accurate over the past 25+ years, even though I rarely told anyone what it was that I had seen, with a few outstanding exceptions, such as 9-11, Bali, and the things that are to occur here in my own country within the next two years.
<br>
<br>
Earth will always change, sometimes over millioins of years, and sometimes over months, as it will in the build-up to the latter part of 2012.

Tayesin,
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to agree with you 100% on the mind set and it really hurts me deeply. I can't tell you how many times I apologize to Mother earth for what we are all doing to her.  She unconditionally gives to us and we disrespect her by our actions and very little appreciation or thanks.  And People have no idea that she transmute as much of the  negative energy  in the world as she can without trying to effect us very much.  We do not live in harmony with her which could have easily been achieved earlier on in history. The arrogance and blind ignorance of individuals here on earth is daunting.
<br>
<br>
It will reach a boiling point but those in a high vibrational thought process will be less effected.  For some it may feel like doomsday, but others will see it as the beginning of the new age.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your input and reply to my post I appreciate and respect your views.

I have one thing to say in this thread. Those of you who are saying "this is nonsense and that's that" are just as foolish as those who are saying "there's no doubt about it". To make up your mind about such an event at this stage can be nothing but foolishness.
<br>
I understand that people have become uninterested in such prophecies and that their experiences have led them to believe that it's all nonsense, but i just feel it's kind of silly to turn your back. It's fine to lean one way or the other, but to make up your mind with such convictions that you feel certain you'll be laughing at everybody when nothing happens coems across as ignorant to me. I think it's wise to keep an ear out and an eye open. Nobody knows the truth of the matter. Keep that in mind.

My view on the matter is that maybe something will happen, and i wouldn't be surprised if it does, but if it does i'm guessing it will be related to a shift in energy. Not necessarily the entire planet ascending to the 5th dimension or something, but perhaps just a subtle shift in energy that most won't even notice. On the other hand, it could all just be hype. Only time will tell.

What I'm really looking for here in understanding about something that pushes my HUH?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
buttons so hard that my brain fries.  I think you and other moderators and experienced posters know the answer, or I'd just wander off and leave it alone.
<br>
<br>
I'm using this specific forum and your specific post, but I hit this alot.
<br>
<br>
If this
<b>
 bores you
</b>
why do you read the post?  If YOUR recommendation is to "agree to disagree" -- why are YOU debating?  Why post at all on an issue that you either consider to be of no value or one that simply doesn't resonate for you?
<br>
<br>
I can understand this with novices.  I understand this when people have issues and some post hits an emotional button they need to defend.  I can understand this with folks with dominance issues.  I can come up with half a dozen ways and a thousand scenarios that quiet my "Huh/WTF?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
" reaction, but those don't work here for me.
<br>
<br>
I can't understand this out of YOU and a number of other people.
<br>
<br>
I am thinking, given my history and past performance, that this will have to do with a set of my own expectations that are just stupid.  It doesn't FEEL like that.  It feels like there's important information here that I personally am missing
<br>
<br>
If you can, please explain to me why on a forum with thousands of post on so many different issues, that's just one forum in nearly a universe of discussion sites on the internet,
<i>
 you personally
</i>
would take the time to comment on something bores you.  Why even read it?
<br>
<br>
Or is this one of those basic things I've missed in my internet learning and development, and it's a moderators JOB -- that you have to read it all as part of your duties as a moderator, and hence your comments just come out of that.
<br>
<br>
Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  I STILL can't find a way to say this so that my real question comes through and not chatter of criticism.  I really don't mean this as a critique, just painful level of bewilderment about a human dynamic.

It only takes one example of proof if your looking at the mind in a logical sense to know that it can be deceived.

The mind can be deceived in many many ways.  Drugs, alcohols, extreme heat ( mirage's), Extreme cold, Darkness....hmmm what is that in the dark, even thought it is your eyes seeing it is your mind processing the info.

You may be speaking of a different aspect of the mind or maybe have a different opinion on what the mind is, but from my position the mind can be trick.

Are you referring to the physical brain or the mental unit / mind?  There's a huge difference.  I would agree that the mental unit / mind is not perfect, but it is far more perfect the emotions.  As far as the physical brain ... well have you ever seen a zombie.  A zombie is an empty physical shell with no Soul.  It's dumber than dumb.  Now our divine self is perfect.

Had a short absence from posting on the forums for a few reasons and missed any early posts on this thread. I suppose it wouldn't be of any benefit of the thread to address the earlier posts that are now buried under more recent ones, but I will say that I certainly agree with the following quote that joya made:

 You know, I do not appreciate (Frank and others) labeling people with different ideas as "younger" and therefore implying that WISDOM comes with age. It seems that I see the same people posting their "I know better than you" or "you only believe this because you are young" opinions over and over.
</blockquote>
<br>
This isn't just something that little kids believe, though it seems it would certainly require somewhat of an open or indescriminate thought process to fairly evaluate the subject, especially from a lot of what I've read here, and those sorts of things are of course more common among the younger generations.
<br>
<br>
Some Tibetan monks recently spoke to their local media regarding the subject and I tend to respect monks quite a bit, so it carried some weight for me.

The article actual reminded me of the Titor posts more than anything, which I at first thought was a little eerie since I'm not thoroughly convinced that Titor was actually from the future. I suppose these types of messages are effective so long as they get some thought going, as opposed to a descriminatory, conditioned 'not again' outlook. I don't take the 'May whatever-day Pole-Shift" 's seriously either, but because of the accuracy of the Mayan calendars, I tend to put a little faith in the Mayans' designation of 2012 as a year that signifies a new celestial cycle. As for dates of anything else.. maybe, maybe not. But a lot of things seem to be heading towards a big simultaneous climax, with global warming becoming more apparent and political situations becoming more tense with wars and scandals, the Book of Revelations starting to seem to come into play, and then on top of this, a literal 'new age' designated as 2012 by the Mayans (This is why all of their calendars stop there. I believe the cycle that this date is a part of is either the biggest or 2nd biggest cycle they kept track of.).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Where will I be in 2012? Ahhhhhhhh.. I have no idea ://  But maybe hopefully in the Appalachians somewhere.

 "... this isn't just something that little kids believe..."
</i>
<br>
<br>
I know, and that's precisely what makes the whole scenario just so ridiculous! It's the sort of creative fantasy you'd expect from children, but it's actually adults doing the fantasising.
<br>
<br>
This kind of thing is something that certain kinds of people have indulged in for probably as long as we've been occupying this planet. All the while these dates have come and gone, and each generation thinks up new dates and they pass by, and so it continues. But don't let that inconvenient fact spoil your doomsday party.
<br>
<br>
I guess it is comforting for certain types of people to dream that one day, all that they deem to be nasty, unworthy people will get their comeuppance, and that all the "good" people (as they typically think of themselves) will be "saved". But 2012 will come and go just like any other year. All the main protagonists will broadcast their excuses, everyone else will try to save face by fudging the issue, and the following generation will prepare their script for the next date. 2020 perhaps? That's a nice round number, or what about 2050? Bit too far away I suppose, but a nice date for future generations.
<br>
<br>
Based on previous form my money is on the "got our dates wrong" excuse. You'd think this would have worn thin a hundred generations ago at least. But no, people today still believe it.
<br>

I find it amazing that threads like this recieve the most posts. It kind of scares me actually, as I see people like Frank and Nay trying to wisen up some of the people on the current 2012 (and not so current prediction/numerology 'game'), and I see the rest going 'but what if?'.
<br>
<br>
The reason why I am scared is because there is a major mental war going on here in my mind. The 'believers in doom' can be considered to be slowly mentally creating the scenario, while the 'wiser ones' are fending off their reality attack. Maybe the believers will win this time? I sure hope not.
<br>
<br>
Instead, I really wish they had put more effort into y2k. I really wanted to see everyone's computer start doing backflips and stuff. That would of been cool.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, I'm rooting for the 'wiser ones' team here. Mental-fence! Mental-fence!

I think neither side has the right to say they "know." Who can tell what is or is not going to happen in the future? IMHO it is best to keep the possibilities of both sides in mind cause the future is never written in stone and nobody, not even some of the greatest fortune tellers or predictionists know for certain what is going to happen.

I don't think there's much reason to believe anything really spectacular will occur on any particular date in 2012, but in the upcoming years leading into and centered around 2012 a lot may take place (I agree that nobody really knows). I don't think it'll really be a matter of 'good people being saved' either. If these events actually take place, a lot of everybody will die regardless and it would be hard to tell exactly who.
<br>
<br>
An event like Yellowstone erupting, for example, would cause millions if not billions around the world to die, mostly because all the food grown in the midwest would suffer from a blocking out of sunlight, but also because of massive climate change and of course the 500-mile diameter of carnage from fire and ash (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://whyfiles.org/shorties/083giant_volc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

&lt;-- last major eruption info,

 http://exodus2006.com/supervol.html
</a>
&lt;-- more eruption info). That's not a threat that should be taken for granted, either, since Yellowstone has been showing activity in recent years that goes beyond causing those geysers that tourists love so much (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/activity.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/activity.html
</a>
&lt;-- regularly updated Yellowstone activity information). A recent quake in Alaska gave an eerie foreshadowing of what a nearby eruption might spark Yellowstone to do (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.seis.utah.edu/RecentNews/YNP-11042002.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.seis.utah.edu/RecentNews/YNP-11042002.shtml
</a>
). It's also had regular massive eruptions every few thousand years or so, and I think it's now overdue by its average. It would be considerably worse than Mt. St. Helens (also showing activity again lately,
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/09/29/mount.st.helens/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/09/29/mount.st.helens/
</a>
), and right over our breadbasket. Maybe people will be a little more open to the idea of events like this after the tsunamis in Asia and Africa, which were also warned against but just not expected to do much damage (Do I even need to link to any additional info?).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think
<i>
 those
</i>
are the sorts of events, at least natural-disaster wise, that are going to lead us into 2012 and maybe a little beyond. Hand-in-hand with those events would be political events dealing with the rising tension in the Mid-East, with Bush possibly preparing for a war in Iran (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.etherzone.com/2004/lang112204.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

), which is
<i>
 known
</i>
to have WMDs and will use them against us, and other eastern countries while at home outrage is still being suppressed by propoganda in the media (

</a>
) while more and more people are waking up and realizing what's going on politically in the world. It wouldn't take a history major to realize that this obviously sets the stage for some civil conflict at home, as well as huge problems abroad.
<br>
<br>
North Korea has also been exaggerated as a dire threat, which would suggest the media was setting the stage for war there as well, and tensions between the US and Russia may again be picked up as Putin recently announced the development of a new weapon capable of hitting the US regardless of our current defense systems, which was undoubtedly a result from our own advances in advancing military technology and creating weapons of mass destruction heedless of foreign agreements (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.stopdubya.com/TreatyBusterDubya.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.stopdubya.com/TreatyBusterDubya.htm
</a>
, and such as our illegal manufacturing of anthrax which became public around the time of the anthrax scares,
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.nogw.com/articles/realbioterror.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.nogw.com/articles/realbioterror.html
</a>
). And the corruption within the system is there but expressed more in other threads here and too involved to go into here. Still, it's there, and people are starting to realize this more and more and it isn't helping our politcal situation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then, of course, there's global warming and everything it stands for: climates changing, deteriorating ozone, heat waves killing thousands in Europe, unusual storms in unusual amounts doing unusual damage, parts of the ice caps breaking off and entering strange parts of the world or melting at unprecedented rates. What's interesting is that the rest of our solar system is showing unusual activity. The Sun is a good example of this. Remember all those record-breakingly massive flares? They haven't stopped coming (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.spaceweather.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.spaceweather.com/
</a>
), though the media has lost interest, and they certainly still aren't usual and don't fit any scientific observations we've ever made, especially that 'X28' that could've easily been more like X40 back in 2003 (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/984388.asp?0cl=cR&amp;cp1=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.msnbc.com/news/984388.asp?0cl=cR&amp;cp1=1
</a>
). Similar oddities have started plaguing individual planets in our system, as well, in the form of Pluto warming as it moves farther into space (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/pluto_warming_021009.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/pluto_warming_021009.html
</a>
), Jupiter's spots weakening and climate changing (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/04/21_jupiter.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/04/21_jupiter.shtml
</a>
), climate change on Mars (

 http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48895,00.html
</a>
), etc.
<br>
<br>
I think the developlment of those things are going to be what leads us into change around 2012. The fact that the Mayans designated that as an important year may show that spiritually, this is the year of an important change as well. I think 2012 was once referred to on these boards as 'midnight' for all of these things; the precise date given for a series of events that are still unfolding and will continue to unfold after 2012 from the view that we're entering a new celestial age as we cycle further through the cosmos. I don't see how that would be much more difficult to believe than there is a such thing as Astral Projection, or God. Especially combined with  current events that are definitely unique to our times, the idea that we're entering new times doesn't seem that hard to believe for me at least.
<br>
<br>
Again, this doesn't mean that all 2012 beliefs necessarily mean that on December 12th or whatever it is 2012, bad people will suddenly die and the good will be saved or whatever you're under the impression of it meaning. Just that we're entering a period of extraordinary change and unfortunately a lot of carnage may very easily come with that, and it seems likely will if these things to continue to unfold at all. Thousands and thousands have already died from that tsunami, and the war in Iraq has killed over 100,000 Iraqi civilians alone. Saying that more people will die from natural disasters and war is not saying much. Saying that the war will only get worse isn't saying much either, and science is already showing that natural disasters are on a major rise. It isn't a very big step from that to believing that these things will climax and then stabilize (certainly they won't go on forever!), one way or another, in the near future, and then putting this under a label of a new start for humanity. The Mayans already threw us a date, so, whatever works.

people keep saying 'well you cant know either way'.
<br>
<br>
All I would say is instead of reading all about '2012' and 'demon wars' on dodgy websites and dubious 'researched' books... go and look at the *facts' ie look at what reputable archaeologists and historians have to say about the mayan calender, what it actualy refers to and what it doesnt...
<br>
You may be in for a slight letdown with regards to your apocalypse fantasies.. You see, I am one of the few who actually bothered to look into the reality of it.. and its not overly exciting... so yes, i can quite happily say that nothing is going to 'happen'...
<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bore you with the actual facts of the Mayan calender as its something you should read about yourself and those who are actualy interested will find out.. all those who base their info on dodgy websites and books are not going to be convinced so there is not much point as far as they are concerned!
<br>
<br>
In the end they will learn the hard way, as has happened so often in the past! But by then the 'apocalypse' torch will have passed to a new generation with an all new date to worry/fantasise about.

 Summary
 <br>
 <br>
 This has been my attempt to fill a vacuum in Mayan Studies, an answer to the why and how of the end date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan Long Count. The solution requires a shift in how we think about the astronomy of the Long Count end date. The strange fact that it occurs on a winter solstice immediately points us to possible astronomical reasons, but they are not obvious. We also shouldn't forget the often mentioned fact that the 13-baktun cycle of some 5125 years is roughly 1/5th of a precessional cycle. This in itself should have been suggestive of a deeper mystery very early on. Only with the recent identification of the astronomical nature of the Sacred Tree has the puzzle revealed its fullness. And once again we are amazed at the sophistication and vision of the ancient New World astronomers, the decendants of whom still count the days and watch the skies in the remote outbacks of Guatemala.
 <br>
 <br>
 This essay is not contrived upon sketchy evidence. It basically rests upon two facts:
 <br>
 <br>
 1) the well known end date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan Long Count, which is December 21st, 2012 A.D. and
 <br>
 <br>
 2) the astronomical situation on that day. Based upon these two facts alone, the creators of the Long Count knew about and calculated the rate of precession over 2300 years ago. I can conceive of no other conclusion. To explain this away as "coincidence" would only obscure the issue.
 <br>
 <br>
 For early Mesoamerican skywatchers, the slow approach of the winter solstice sun to the Sacred Tree was seen as a critical process, the culmination of which was surely worthy of being called 13.0.0.0.0, the end of a World Age. The channel would then be open through the winter solstice doorway, up the Sacred Tree, the Xibalba be , to the center of the churning heavens, the Heart of Sky.

Why is it that people will chime in and tell there side with no links, proof and claim they are virtually all knowing?  It makes them look arrogant and ignorant.  My claims about 2012 stem from much research and information, whether people get off their behinds and search into it is another issue. And yes it does take time. Hearsay info is just that and if you are looking for a truth you need to dig in.
<br>
<br>
If you are going to make a claim back it with some evidence and facts, then people can come to their own conclusion, otherwise it is just hot air coming from one source.
<br>
<br>
Whether my claims on 2012 based on research, intuition and other avenues are correct are my own gut theories, but again they are based on much research from many different and diverse sources.
<br>
<br>
And no I don't know all and don't claim too, but the 2011,12,13 dates are very significant and the Mayans were extremely accurate mathematicians and astrologers, if you have extensive mathematics backgrounds and can the do proper calculations and understand astrology you will she how significant and accurate their systems are.  The Gregorian Calender the one every misinformed uses today is the one that is extremely flawed and does not follow any logic or proper astrological cycle. Leap year(LOL) 365, 31 days in some months, 28 days in other, 30 in others etc....... Challenge the current calendar and time system and you will see the truths. Basically if you set up your own standard of time you can control the masses, that is what the Gregorian calendar is it follows no cycles but it's own.

Research for what might happen in the future is destructive in my opinion. Since you don't know what is going to happen it's fruitless and you can't really know if it will do any good or not.

<section>
Dragon,
<br>
<br>
I will agree with you in part, but many here claim to be able to time travel by astral projection and see the future. What about them?
<br>
<br>
The future I believe is not set in stone, but with the path we are on now it appears something has to give.
<br>
<br>
In the past we didn't have the level of communication as today world wide and as we push forward in this unsustainable world industry, government and economy something is coming down the pipe quickly based on the amount of individuals in the world involved there days.
<br>
<br>
Whether it will be a good thing or bad thing I don't know, but so far things are aren't looking like they are going smoothly in our unsustainable world.
<br>
<br>
The ethics and morals of people in high places, and power positions these days are in a state of disarray.  Everything appears to be a me me me agenda and those that enter the arena with good intention find they cannot buck the current system.
<br>
<br>
I don't really have any answer to the current problems, but it doesn't take a time traveler, psychic, Mayans, or anyone else to tell us something is really out of wack world wide.  Look at the WMD world wide this is only one area.
<br>
<br>
Previously in time we didn't have the destructive capabilities that we do today and we didn't have many different cultures and societies with these capabilities even 15 years ago, even though we had the madness, chaos and people controlling issues.
<br>
<br>
If we could get some kind of ET intervention I would hope it would be real soon, so this destructive path we are on is diverted.
<br>
<br>
And if you don't plan for a future of some sort and do the research what good will the future hold?

I guess you don't know what an ET is it can be anything from a little green guy to a Spirit guide you meet on the astral plan. ET means something other than humans.

RT, I myself have viewed events in the past through projection. The future, however, is quite hazy. Anyone claiming to travel to the future through a projection is actually projecting into a
<b>
 possible
</b>
future, and not necissarily the future we are going to see.
<br>
<br>
As for the state of the world, it is true that we have more destructive weapons, however, I would like to note that history shows us humanity is less aggressive today than it was in the past. At least we don't start wars simply because one small discourtesy in court occured on accident, or because a local shaman decided a christian priest didn't know what he was talking about.

I don't mean to come off angry because I am not, I just get a bit frustrated when people won't take a look in another direction.
<br>
<br>
I am always open to look at what the other person's point of view is as long as he can give me something solid to understand and not just because he said.
<br>
<br>
I am often guilty myself of forgetting to post links, facts or material so that others may see my point of view and then come up with their own.
<br>
<br>
I see people brainwashed and distracted by TV, video games, drugs, alcohol and wasting time living vicariously through others instead of living and finding truths out for themselves.  One person may not be able to solve the world problems but the world working together can.
<br>
<br>
I am frustrated these days because I do see the people at the top thinking that they are pulling the wool of the eyes of the masses and creating just enough chaos so that focus of the truth is offset.
<br>
<br>
Basically my belief about 2012 is that time as we know it will end and I don't mean the end of the world or destruction, but simply time itself and the system we know as money will also disappear.
<br>
<br>
What will follow will be a golden age. People will not try to control each other but help and learn what we have forgotten.

*deep breath*
<br>
<br>
Ok, I have googled, taking Gandalf's advice and frankly I was disappointed.
<br>
<br>
Most of the sites were all bright neon and frilly with really large text "
<span class="bbc_size" style="font-size: 18px;">
 THE END IS NEAR
</span>
" to get the people even more excited about the end of...of.....of something.  Heck on one site Unicorns was a topic.   (oh geez, did I just start another topic for debate?)
<br>
<br>
As I sit here and try and put into words why I think this is all a waste of energy and time, it occurs to me that on alot of these sites these people spend an extraordinary amount of time doing this "research".
<br>
<br>
I think that is what shys me away from it all.  They seem so......desperate, alone and searching.  They spend all this time searching the net getting others opinions.  And the minute I start reading it, I feel such frantic feelings.  I can't explain it, it's not a good feeling I'll say that.
<br>
<br>
If all everyone wants is to hear me say...."ok, it's going to happen" well, then what?
<br>
<br>
Do we start talking about buying land some where and getting together to live this out?  How about food?  when this happens, are we going to have to kill our own food, or will there be any animals left for us to do that?  I want to know what I'm suppose to do when this happens.  Tell me.

Hi Nay,
<br>
All the 2012 predictions aside for now, you asked some questions about what you should do.  Only you know, inside.
<br>
<br>
In two days, my lady and I are heading up into the mountains to follow the Insight, Seeing and directions we have both had individually for more than 20 years.
<br>
<br>
I've known about the need for me to build a Sanctuary since I was 15 (1975), and my lady has known about the need to build what she called Haven for about the same amount of time.
<br>
<br>
At the Akasha recently we saw the area we are to build this place, and saw the time-frame we have to do it in.  Which is why we are going up to look for the land now.
<br>
<br>
No one can convince you of anything, and I know you to be a lovely, caring, knowledge-able, understanding human being.  If you are meant to do something about it then you will when the Timing is perfect, otherwise you will not.  And when the time comes you will know what to do.
<br>
<br>
For now, I see no reason to worry about what hasn't come yet.  I see no reason to think, we need to stock food and water,etc.. as so many others have been doing now for more than 30 years.
<br>
<br>
Now we need to only work on our awareness.  Work on how we deal with detractors.  Work on clearing our own connections to spirit, etc.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, instead of worrying or even being concerned about possibilities and probabilities, we should be interested in Now.  Living it now, being aware in the moment of our surroundings and enjoying what we can.
<br>
<br>
No-one truly knows the hour, or if that Hour will even arrive !!  So eat, be merry, love, and be aware for when/if the time comes.
<br>
<br>
Love Always.

Hi Nay,
<br>
I know....  you have been saying Live Now... all along.  And I repeated it with one addition..  to be aware of our surroundings. Important that one.
<br>
<br>
It's quite a difficult time right now isn't it ?
<br>
<br>
LOL at paraphrased no to worry about it coz there is the next life.... I didn't actually mean it like that, but it is one way of looking at it.
<br>
<br>
About clearing our personal connections with Spirit....  it is so important right now.  I'm even thinking it is more important for each person to stand in what has been proven to them by their connection with Spirit, and totally disregard most of what others say, as we head into deeper doo-doo times.
<br>
<br>
So many false prophets abound in the world for now, each with their own agendas, and so too in the astral realms.  Even here at AP !!
<br>
<br>
Many want to convert people to their way, as if it
<b>
 is
</b>
the end days approaching...  so much Indoctrinated, dogmatic, believe at all costs types of approaches...  too much for the average Joe Bloggs to sift through.
<br>
<br>
All we need to do really, is allow ourselves to grow in the ways that work for us, even if no one else agrees with it...  coz hay... who is to say who is right and who is wrong ?  Certainly no human alive today !
<br>
<br>
Don't let me get you paranoid.....  I may throw some facts here or there occasionally about things that are happening, other times I might add bits and pieces I have heard, if it resonates, and the rest of the time I am busy as hell trying to get through every day as it comes.   And, surviving it in a mentally stable way....and umm... I don't think I am succeeding right now !!

  Summary
  <br>
  <br>
  This has been my attempt to fill a vacuum in Mayan Studies, an answer to the why and how of the end date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan Long Count. The solution requires a shift in how we think about the astronomy of the Long Count end date. The strange fact that it occurs on a winter solstice immediately points us to possible astronomical reasons, but they are not obvious. We also shouldn't forget the often mentioned fact that the 13-baktun cycle of some 5125 years is roughly 1/5th of a precessional cycle. This in itself should have been suggestive of a deeper mystery very early on. Only with the recent identification of the astronomical nature of the Sacred Tree has the puzzle revealed its fullness. And once again we are amazed at the sophistication and vision of the ancient New World astronomers, the decendants of whom still count the days and watch the skies in the remote outbacks of Guatemala.
  <br>
  <br>
  This essay is not contrived upon sketchy evidence. It basically rests upon two facts:
  <br>
  <br>
  1) the well known end date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan Long Count, which is December 21st, 2012 A.D. and
  <br>
  <br>
  2) the astronomical situation on that day. Based upon these two facts alone, the creators of the Long Count knew about and calculated the rate of precession over 2300 years ago. I can conceive of no other conclusion. To explain this away as "coincidence" would only obscure the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  For early Mesoamerican skywatchers, the slow approach of the winter solstice sun to the Sacred Tree was seen as a critical process, the culmination of which was surely worthy of being called 13.0.0.0.0, the end of a World Age. The channel would then be open through the winter solstice doorway, up the Sacred Tree, the Xibalba be , to the center of the churning heavens, the Heart of Sky.

 Do we start talking about buying land some where and getting together to live this out? How about food? when this happens, are we going to have to kill our own food, or will there be any animals left for us to do that? I want to know what I'm suppose to do when this happens. Tell me.

lol... This is pretty much what I've been planning for a couple years now, for numerous reasons. Living in a small community in the mountains off of the wild is actually really appealing to me and the other guys that are going after college. Getting back in touch with nature.

Actually I have already done this, bought a 50 acres and I am in the slow process of building an earth home on the land (cause of money).  It will be a cottage until our transition date, if I build it will be symbiotic with nature. I am not in the mountains but near some great fresh bodies of water, even though I love the mountains.
<br>
<br>
Earth homes can be build extremely cheap and are much stronger and efficient than conventional stick building.

Nay,
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you're right -- I just can't GET it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is an issue that I have been circling for months now -- and not just on Astral Pulse.  It keeps popping up in different aspects of my life.
<br>
<br>
It's my nature to be quiet.  It's not part of my makeup to usually need to speak things out to learn them.  I HAVE been pondering this -- actually, here in Cow Country we call it "ruminating" -- but I'm chasing my tail.
<br>
<br>
There are issues that block my growth that I can't work out by myself.  Usually -- like this one -- I get most totally blocked when I recognize all kinds of acceptable "answers" that cover most instances, but miss something key.
<br>
<br>
With those, I find I have to "put the ball in play" and get the idea knocked around a bit.  I usually select people I feel are teachers or experts in the area I'm trying to explore -- people where the many answers just don't cover it.
<br>
<br>
I had hoped that the answer was going to be that as a moderator this was your job.
<br>
<br>
My linear mind firmly believes that it's very simple -- groups have individuals who police ideas and punish those who are outside the sigma bands in order to protect group cohesion.
<br>
<br>
My non-linear mind thinks the linear part of me is a "poor baboo" that completely misses everything of importance.
<br>
<br>
I know this is a personal issue of mine that indicates a growth gateway.  It's nobody's problem but mine.  I have found a number of generous people out here on AP with the skill to work through the changes.
<br>
<br>
Safe journey and thanks,

We leave tonight to go to the Mountains, to find the land we are meant to build a Sanctuary on.   I'll be away for a few days or so.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, has anyone else noticed the total lack of earthquake activity in the normally highly active areas of the world, since the magnitude 9 that caused the Tsunamis ?
<br>
<br>
Hmmm, Interesting...maybe something largish to come soon in either Turkey, Afghanistan, Japan or New Zealand...  maybe.
<br>
<br>
Be well everyone, I'll post about the trip to the mountains when I get back.
<br>

If a magnetic pole shift does happen anytime in my lifetime-unless either I or someone who loves me enough invents a nice FTL spacecraft. OR I or someone who loves me is the world's greatest wizard/mage etc-I think I'm pretty much toast. So like nuclear disaster or similar I'm not going to even consider it worth worrying about. Unless there is something real that I can actually do at that time to get myself and the people I care about away to safety.
<br>
To me that safety doesn't mean to survive barely for the years afterwards in an impoverished state either.
<br>
So for me this is another reason not to worry about 2012 predictions and similar stuff. It's irrelevent to me. I can't stop it if it's gonna happen. I don't believe the things myself. too many doomsday dates come and go. Nothing happens.

The sanctuary sounds like a great fun idea in itself Tayesin. Could be a wonderful spiritual retreat in it's own right.

Having a sanctuary sounds like an interesting and adventorous idea to me as well, however I would suggest that it also be made with other interests in mind in case these prophecies don't pan out.  If the events in 2012 don't happen, it should have other functions so as not to put its makers in debt.

Everyone knows that on 6/06/06 the antichrist will be born, and that in the year 2012 he will be 6 years old. And anyone that knows a 6-year-old child also knows that *any* 6-year-old with superhuman powers is going to wreak havoc...
<br>
<br>
Seriously, though, if you take the time to look up the reason for the 2012 date on the ancient calendar (and you don't exclusively look in the New Age section), you find it's far less doomsday than popular craze goes on about.

Who said anything about doomsday? Life will most certainly go on no matter what happens. The Mayans did see 2012 as the start of something new, though, which it is. Sort of like a big celestial 'new year'. Once again

<br>
Yeah, I wouldn't plan things solely on possible future events either.
<br>
<br>
Something about living in the wild appeals to me either way, though. When I talk about it with friends, we don't even have that sort of stuff in mind. It's all about the freedom and peace living among nature. Takes some research, though. It seems it would be easy to starve, especially in the last months of winter before spring finally arrives. Helps to research edible wild foods, storage methods, and Native American methods of survival. Shelter really isn't a problem today with all the high quality tents and sleeping bags in production, as well as heavily insulated clothing. You can even take different kinds of portable power generators to capacitate a few technological luxuries if you want. Food is the only thing that isn't so easily covered in the wild if you don't know where to get it. But imagine how nice it would be out there

 Remote viewing Tibetan monks see Extra Terrestrial powers saving the World from destroying itself in 2012 N.K. Subramanium, Special Correspondent December 26, 2004
 <br>
 <br>
 Remote viewing is nothing new in Tibetan monasteries. For thousands of years remote viewing in the middle of other spiritual activities have dominated Tibetan culture. What some Indian tourists came to learn from a few Tibetan monasteries under the current Chinese rule is extremely alarming and fascinating.
 <br>
 <br>
 According to these tourists remote viewers are seeing world powers in the course of self-destruction. They also see that the world will not be destroyed. Between now and 2012 the world super powers will continue to engage in regional wars. Terrorism and covert war will be the main problem. In world politics something will happen in and around 2010. At that time the world powers will threaten to destroy each other.
 <br>
 <br>
 Between 2010 and 2012, the whole world will get polarized and prepare for the ultimate dooms day. Heavy political maneuvers and negotiations will take place with little progress.
 <br>
 <br>
 In 2012, the world will start plunging into a total destructive nuclear war.
 <br>
 <br>
 And at that time something remarkable will happen, says, Buddhist monk of Tibet. Supernatural divine powers will intervene. The destiny of the world is not to self-destruct at this time.
 <br>
 <br>
 Scientific interpretation of the monks' statements makes it evident that the Extra Terrestrial powers are watching us every step of the way. They will intervene in 2012 and save the world from self-destruction.
 <br>
 <br>
 When asked about recent UFO sightings in India and China, the monks smiled and said the divine powers are watching us all. Mankind cannot and will not be allowed to alter the future to that great extent.
 <br>
 <br>
 Every human being though their current acts in life called "Karma" can alter the future lives to some extent, but changing the destiny in that large extent will not be allowed to that great an extent.
 <br>
 <br>
 Monks also mentioned that beyond 2012 our current civilization would understand that the final frontier of science and technology is in area of spirituality and not material physics and chemistry. Beyond 2012, out technologies will take a different direction. People will learn the essence of spirituality, the relation between body and the soul, the reincarnation and the fact we are connected with each other are all part of "God".
 <br>
 <br>
 In India and China UFO sightings have increased in many folds. Many say the Chinese and Indian Governments are being contacted by the Extra Terrestrials.
 <br>
 <br>
 In recent days most UFO activities have been seen in those countries who have indigenously developed Nuke capabilities.
 <br>
 <br>
 When asked if these extra-terrestrials will show up in reality in 2012, the answers remote viewers are giving is: they will reveal themselves in such a way that none of us scared. They will reveal themselves only if they have to. As our science and technology progresses, we are destined to see them and interact with them any way.
 <br>
 <br>
 According to the remote viewers, our earth is blessed and is being saved continuously from all kinds of hazards all the time that we are not even aware of. As our technologies progress we will realize how external forces saved us.

Hi all,
<br>
Karnautrahl and LordoftheBunnies, made an excellent point for anyone considering going to the mountains and setting up a Sanctuary.
<br>
<br>
The place we have seen is for all possibilities and probabilities.  It will be open to people who need time out, needed growth in awareness, etc.  Whether the prophecies, my visions or anyone Else's do or do not come to reality, we will be offering service and retreat for others.  That is one of our tasks.
<br>
<br>
So it's all good.
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
<br>
<br>
We found a township that perfectly suits as a base for all of our plans and needs, and within 20 minutes of the Main Mountain Range we saw in the visions and at the Akasha.  We will buy into the town, slowly build our spiritual work around the districts and larger centers while we wait for the right property to come up in the Mountains, so we can buy it for Sanctuary.
<br>
<br>
It will come within the next 2 years.
<br>
<br>
Smilin' big time here folks.

Tayesin,
<br>
<br>
It's sounds like a wonderful place. And I would love to visit one day.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I just hope for all on earth that don't have the resources that they will take the time to go to a place for a recharge and rest.  Life is very draining energy wise and we get so caught up in the day-to-day rigors that we forget to recharge our batteries, this is when we are very vulnerable to negative things, thoughts and emotions occurring.
<br>
<br>
So take a bit of time for yourselves and recharge, even if it is just a nice hot bath, reflect, then clear your mind, because you can't help anyone else unless you recharge yourself.
<br>
<br>
Peace,
<br>
