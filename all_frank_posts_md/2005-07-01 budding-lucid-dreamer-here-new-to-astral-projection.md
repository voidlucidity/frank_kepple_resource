<section>
Hi there, i'm a member of a LD4All, a lucid dreaming community and I have been trying very hard to willingly induce lucid dreams.
<br>
<br>
In the midst of a conversation about lucid dreaming with a friend of mine, she mentioned she could willingly seperate her soul from her body by meditating.  At first I didn't understand how this was possible (or even what she meant) but then I asked a few other friends and one of them had an experience similair to what the first friend described.
<br>
<br>
The friend's experience went a little something like this: he was sleeping one night with faint xmas lights on in his room.. he had just smoked a fair amount of Cannabis and was laying in bed when he felt like there was something pulling him from either side, and he could feel some force moving on his body.. then before he knew it he was lifted up to the cieling of his bedroom and could view everything, including himself.....
<br>
<br>
After hearing about this experience I went on the net and found The Astral Pulse.. i'm happy to know that our minds are capable of such spiritual journeys and im excited that I may soon be able to do it!
<br>
<br>
and so begins my story of Astral Projection

"i'm happy to know that our minds are capable of such spiritual journeys".........? How about "our spirits are capable of having mind journeys"?

Hi Forw4rd
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Forums.  Glad you found us.
<br>
<br>
Keep a dream journal - the surefire way to lucid dreaming, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Oh, and eat, breathe and think about nothing else for 24 hours a day.  You'll be lucid dreaming in no time at all!

<br>
<br>
Once you start lucid dreaming, it tends to have a snowballing effect.  Well, it does me.  I become "alert" during dreams much more these days than I ever used to.  I still haven't worked out quite what triggers it, but I don't mind as long as I continue to have them.
