To THAT, I must reply with some Elvira wisdom:
<br>
<br>
(from
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.elvira.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
)
<br>
<br>
Naturally, when you're as beautiful and glamorous as me, people are just dying to get your recipe for success...but there's no need to go to such an extreme.
<br>
With a little thought and a few bucks even you can look almost as good as me.
<br>
<br>
Rule #1: Black clothing is very important. Not only will you look totally hip and cool, but you can wear the same outfit for months and the dirt and stains will never show.
<br>
<br>
Rule #2: Black is always the best color for evening, because no one will be able to see you on dark streets, so you can walk home alone from that special party without fear of being mugged.*
<br>
<br>
Rule #3: Remember that a little rubber and a few metal studs will add a sophisticated touch to all your lingerie.
<br>
<br>
Rule #4: Cleavage is two of the most important things a girl can own. If you don't happen to have my attributes, you certainly have my condolences. But don't give up! You can make your own cleavage by using a pair of your brother's old gym socks (see "Patti's Pointers" in photo at right) to push up what you've got.
<br>
Or, if there's nothing there to push up, try doing 50,000 bust exercises every morning or just draw on some cleavage using a magic marker, Be creative.
<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT FASHION NEWS: Hats are OUT - Big hair is IN!
<br>
<br>
Rule #5: Be thrifty. As my friend "Leatherface" once said, dressing well need not cost you an arm and a leg. I do all my shopping at K-Mart. I mean, where else can you stop off on your way out for the evening and pick up a polyester leisure suit, garter belt and a rubber hose all under one roof?
<br>
<br>
Rule #6: Dress to kill, not just to maim. Clothing is very important. Think about it, without clothing you'd be walking around naked.
<br>
<br>
Now get out there darling, and knock 'em dead!
<br>
Why be a fashion victim when you can commit fashion homicide?
<br>
<br>
*Of course, black isn't the only color that's appropriate to wear.
<br>
Blue goes well as a coordinating color, but stay away from people who are into S&amp;M.
<br>

That's ever so funny.

PS
<br>
You say Elvira mentioned about how cleavage is one of two of the most important things a "girl" can own. Was mention of the first but not of the second... or did I miss it?
