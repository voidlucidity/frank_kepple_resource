I've been a spontaneous nocturnal OBE'er since I was a toddler.   But guess what?  I didn't identify it as such until I was in my late 30's when I did an Internet search on levitation and found a website by Dr. Tan Kheng Khoo.
<br>
Until then, I thought I was unique...singled out by some kind of "god" out of six billion people on earth.  I wasn't sure what "it" was or what "it" wanted.
<br>
How sad it took so long to find out, how glad I am that I finally could put a name to it!
<br>
I have had at least a thousand of them I bet, and I always have complete recall.   Although a few experiences stand out among the many, which is why over time, I have forgotten the many that don't stand out.
<br>
Anyway, I was listening to the first hour of Robert Bruce being interviewed on Coast to Coast the other night, and I particularly enjoyed that, and that's why I looked him up on the Internet and found this website.
<br>
I have very few answers, and one piece of proof that there is definitely something going on, but which I can't prove to anyone.
<br>
And I have a quite a few questions...that maybe only a few might have the answers to.
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read about me, and I look forward to interesting discussions, and possibly making a few like-minded friends, which would be an unexpected blessing.

Hello my name is Jeremy and I found this site through the coast to coast web site after listing to the show on astral projections.  OB E's are very interesting me and I would like to find out more about them.
