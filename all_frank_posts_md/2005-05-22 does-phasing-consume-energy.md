<section>
Hi all !
<br>
<br>
I got a question about the relationship Phasing &lt;-&gt; Energy. I do not know in which category this falls into. I put it here as my question quotes a post made in this same category.
<br>
<br>
I want to mention that this is my first post after spending a great amount of time dwelling to the posts, despite I'm new to forum. I'm French, so please forgive me for any mistake I could do in English.
<br>
<br>
I'm so happy to have discovered this forum. I'm 27 and I've spent more than 10 years entering to what I now understand to be Fz or 3D-Blackness, each time amazed by the sensations linked to this, the loss of all body sensations, the feeling to become a point of consciousness, the so pleasant expansion, the deepening of the blackness, the clarity of mind, the energy sensations, etc.
<br>
I've always been drawn since childhood to what was called mostly "astral voyage", but some people were saying that astral voyage is extremely dangerous. The ironic thing is that I realize now that these people have
<u>
 no
</u>
knowledge of AP, they only repeat what they hear (and want to hear I think), and I was too stupid to believe this instead of trying to learn more and checking by myself.....  Fortunately, this could not prevent me from going on with meditation at bedtime, despite those silly stories about people who would lose their minds, have their body stolen during exit, the evil spirits waiting for you at the other side, and so on. So, without any knowledge and method, I merely tried to find my way to reach deeper altered states of consciousness, while learning to overcome fears by experience. So, I eventually went again and again and again to Fz, each time refining the way to get there during all these years. I can go there fairly easily, as you can guess. Quite a long time ago, I read the first book of Robert Monroe, but it did not help me to understand where I was. I understand now he changed later his conclusions. Quite recently, I read Astral Dynamics which revealed a lot of things to me : AP is perfectly natural ! You can imagine my enthusiasm. So I tried to project, to go out of my body after Fz, to get the vibrations, but this failed so far because I guess I was too much trying to go
<u>
 out
</u>
of the body. In a sudden urge to learn more, I got very recently Far Journeys and Adrian's book Our Ultimate Reality. Very good books. And also I discovered this forum and got very clear explanations for focuses of attention and Phasing.
<br>
A revolution for me
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
I'm now aware of the fact that Fz is a portal to AP. The ironic thing is that I went to Fz so many times, but then each and every time I focused my attention to the exhilarating feelings of this state and the shift in the kinesthetic perception of my environment, e.g. partly spatially-oriented and therefore focused on my body, instead of noticing any change occurring in the 3D-blackness ! Would have really liked to find out this forum years earlier ! I guess also that the wrong beliefs based on fear subconsciously sabotaged the process to go further.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I want to do a big thank you to Adrian, Frank, Major Tom and many others whose posts dramatically changed my understanding of the experiences I had so far and of the wider reality.
<br>
Now I do want to AP. I tried yesterday but could not reach Fz, lol. I guess I'm a bit overloaded with information and excitation right now
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
<br>
I may need to calm down and integrate all the info before. I hope I'll be able soon to come back with another post saying "I did it!"
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
I have a question, that may possibly be more addressed to Frank because this is related to a reply he made, but I would welcome everyone sharing on this. So here is the post

 I say "open" the yellow centre because that's how it feels. It's like all the muscles in your abdomen have totally relaxed and a big hole has opened up in the middle of your belly, lol. When this happens I have to get on the head side of things quick, else I'll feel an energy rush upwards to my heart centre (green) which will set off that centre. Once that sets off then it ruins any projection attempt. Unless, of course, I actually want to set the green going (which I do now and again, as it's fun to do) in which case I work solely on the yellow and let the energy flood to the green. I can never set the green off directly for some reason. I always have to go yellow to green, but that's probably just me.
</blockquote>
<br>
One of the feelings I have quite often as I reach Fz is the heart centre throbbing very quickly -- which btw I recently understood not being the heart itself thanks to Astral Dynamics. According to what I report above, does this mean that projection cannot be made if the heart centre start throbbing ? I seem to remember that Robert Bruce talked about this as being a rather normal thing (section 'Racing heartbeat'), the heart centre (green) would pulsate energy to generate what he calls the projectable body, then one must trigger the projection reflex to project into it. Could you please clarify this ?
<br>
<br>
Also, something remains confused about the relationship Phasing &lt;-&gt; Energy. To what I've read so far, tt seems that shifts in energy are more OBE-related symptoms, is this correct ? But I can read also that OBE and Phasing can be considered as 2 facets of the same thing. So what about the role of energy gathering in Phasing ? When a focus of attention is performed to reach out (within consciousness) for another area of consciousness, does this "consume" energy ?
<br>
<br>
As I said before, in Astral Dynamics Robert Bruce explains that energy is gathered to generate a projectable double. In Adrian's book, I read that inner worlds vibrates at higher vibrations, and consequently I guess it would require energy gathering to vibrate at a higher frequency and thus be able to get there. In posts about phasing, I notice much more consideration to the "focus" counterpart, it seems that all is about focus of attention and switch within consciousness. Does this mean that Phasing does not require energy gathering ?
<br>
<br>
Again, thanks so much for this forum which will help so many people like me and participates in consciousness evolution.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum and if I may say I think yours is one of the most impressive first posts I have seen anyone make to this forum.
<br>
<br>
I like to fire off the old energy centres now and again, especially the "heart" centre, just for the weird and whacky feelings it gives. I have noticed that when I try projecting
<i>
 in a more conventional sense
</i>
I get a specific kind of interaction between my purple and yellow EC's, which I was referring to in the post you quoted. But this is only when I try projecting
<i>
 directly from the physical
</i>
into what mystics call the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
With my Phasing work I don't get that specific interaction at all. Sometimes I can feel a kind of buzzing and crackling in the background, often static electricity types of crackling and sizzling, which I guess is one or two energy centres working away but it's all very much in the background of my awareness.
<br>
<br>
You can use Fz as a launch-pad to other areas in consciousness. The fact that you can attain the Fz state is a major hurdle overcome in itself. I really wouldn't worry about whatever EC's happen to be buzzing away. Once you reach Fz, you can place the Intent (i.e. a concentrated thought) on what you want to do next. When you are at Fz you are, in a manner of speaking, at the "border" between F2 and F3 of the Phasing Model of consciousness. If you want to slip into the RTZ then you'll have to take a step "back" a tad as the RTZ is right on the "edge" of the physical, i.e. sort of between F1 and F2 of consciousness. So in a sense you have gone too far.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what "astral voyage" is. I'm not sure what people are going on about saying so and so is "extremely dangerous". But I guess it's just a case of people parroting one another to the point of panic. If people truly realised just how straightforward this whole thing is, okay, I step short of saying it is easy... easy it isn't, but it's not all that difficult either. But if people realised just how straightforward this whole thing is, then they wouldn't be so fearful. I think mystics and "gurus" have a vested interest in continuing the hysteria a lot of people feel, as it keeps people clamouring around gurus looking for guidance and "protection". But to me, I feel that a lot of what passes for Psychic Self-Defence is mere borderline paranoia, spread by people who have little real experience of the wider reality.
<br>
<br>
The term "obe" relates more to the traditional belief constructs of astral projection. Whereas Phasing is a term that directly relates to my Phasing Model of consciousness. There is no role of "energy gathering" in Phasing. Any kind of "energy work" just doesn't come into to it. Phasing, in a sense, you could say is a more modern technology that just bypasses the need for any kind of energy work.
<br>
<br>
In the old days people would subscribe to what I call the
<i>
 split and separate
</i>
means of projection. They thought of an "energy body" as a kind of capacitor that needed charging in order to bring it to life, as it were, so it could separate from your physical body and part of your mind would split and go into this energy body. Hence my term split-and-separate. And this energy body was a kind of vehicle that you would use in order to roam around the real-time zone. In order to charge this body, you had to in some way "raise energy". If you failed in your attempt then it was because you hadn't raised enough energy to cause it to separate. So you had all these techniques you had to perform that were said to help in raising enough energy to charge your energy body.
<br>
<br>
You can go down that traditional route if you want. As an application model it was okay in its day, I suppose, but now it's all a bit clunky. Sort of like using a late 80's 286 PC. It'll still kinda do what you want it to do, but it's slow and clunky.
<br>
<br>
The projection technology we have today does away with the energy raising idea.
<br>
<br>
Monroe was the forerunner with his linear focus model. His later work was just brilliant. He was the first person, to my knowledge, who realised that these areas we project to are not places, but are actually
<i>
 focuses of attention
</i>
. This was a BIG breakthrough.
<br>
<br>
I have basically followed in his footsteps over the years and eventually created a new model that incorporates a number of issues Monroe chose not to incorporate in his model. Plus, I have clarified and added a lot that just doesn't come out in Monroe's 2 later books. He put a lot of clues in those books but you need quite a bit of experience already to follow what he is going on about.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, it's up to you which route you take. But if you are already focusing within Fz fairly easily then why not plumb for a transition to Focus 3? Far more interesting an area, IMO, than the old real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That throbbing sensation is expected. According to my research the heart chakra is the projection of the thalamus. The thalamus' reticular nucleus is often referred to as a gate of sensory information flow to the cortex because every sensory input (except the olfactory) have to go through it before becomes a conscious sensation.
<br>
<br>
Actually the reticular nucleus of the thalamus is often described as an organ with heart like intrinsic activity. It internally generates its own pulsations that are modulated by cortical activity. When the cortex sleeps the reticular nucleus get out of inhibition, and starts to generate more synchronous pulses. These pulses closes the sensory channel and shut off the cortex even more completely.
<br>
<br>
The closure happens all the time when the depth of slumber reaches a threshold. After the sensory gate closes in the 2nd stage of sleep you won't be able to feel your physical body neither to hear anything that's external. Without appropriate feedback the internal representation of the body comes out of alignment with the sleeping posture as dream body.
<br>
<br>
At first I usually hear surges of inner noises and feel pulsating pressures in my head. My task is then to let these noises and pulsations unite into a harsh continuous buzz by further relaxing my body and mind and by focusing into a specific direction within my consciousness. Pushing myself upwards through the center of my head will help. After the noises peaked silence comes accompanied by various degree of mild buzz in the background. At this point I can "separate." If you look ahead you would find yourself in the 3D blackness or Fz or whatever.
<br>
<br>
The buzz people hear after this point is simply caused by synchronous activity of neurons in the auditory cortex. This synchronization deepens with sleep. Basically, the more stronger the buzz the more deeper stage of sleep you are in. However, if your attention directed elsewhere you will not be aware of the noises at all or your brain interpret them as music.
<br>
<br>
Other people may feel the pulsations on the middle of their chest area when their senses shut down due to the connections that exist between the thalamus and the neuromatrix. Those people should be more better at gathering bodily vibrations in the heart center if they want to free up their somatosensory phantom. Call this energy rising if you want.
<br>
<br>
This phantom doesn't separate within the physical space as we know it because this body is information not energy or matter. It is "just" the dream body we are always inside. However, when your solar plexus is quite active, something could really separate from your body with its felt detachment, even just temporarily. Real time zone projections has little or nothing to do with this leakage though.
<br>
<br>
Every serious energy practitioner will know that up to the solar plexus a couple of energy centers exist that are actually in use of gathering and accumulating external energy. Atmospheric ions like to accumulate within the abdominal blood pool of the guts. They will excite local nerve endings connected to midbrain structures as part of the neuromatrix that are in interaction with acetylcholinergic cells of the brainstem. Some of these brainstem cells have the task of switching REM sleep on. They provide energy for dreaming. And according to its latest phrasing, phasing is simply another label for wake induced lucid dreams.

Hi!
<br>
<br>
Major Tom,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for replying.
<br>
I understand your idea of narrative. I guess this can be likened - as I read in another post - to the perception of a WILD vs Phasing. Despite both are the same thing, a WILDer expects to be in a dream state so is likely to experience dream-related symptoms, while the APer will have  different perceptions.
<br>
I thought nevertheless that there would exist some shared conditions/experiences. I mean, I would expect the human kind transitioning from physical in the "standard conditions of temperature and pressure"
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
to be bound to some common conditions and experience some common symptoms. Energy could be part of these shared conditions/experiences, in our example, a leakage in the heart centre would ruin (I understand now this is not the case for Phasing) the process whatever the expectations/beliefs of the individual.
<br>
But I understand, as you say, that this may be much more subjective than this.
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your kind first remark.
<br>
<br>
I'm pleased to learn that Phasing does not require energy gathering, even more that I understand that I'll still be able to project if my heart centre starts throbbing.
<br>
<br>
I agree with your point about mystics and gurus. What might be the worst indeed is that ordinary people also participate in the propagation of wrong beliefs, without questioning it. So, people who trust them (children, friends, ...) may be strongly influenced and in turn do the same thing, and so on. This is quite interesting to see how subjects linked to notions of death/spirit/paranormal, etc, can have a strong influence on people's mind. Take a group of people and try to make them believe with conviction that, the night before, you suddenly saw some kind of ghost crossing your room. People will laugh at this but I would bet that at least one of them will have some apprehension the same day when going back home! AP sounds like 'paranormal' for still many people today, thus the convenience to ignore this or saying this is dangerous. Without forums like Astral Pulse where many people share about their experience, going against those "advices" and crossing the physical line is like daring to engage in the forest of the movie "The Village" ...
<br>
<br>
This is funny to read "the RTZ is right on the edge of the physical, i.e. sort of between F1 and F2 of consciousness. So in a sense you have gone too far." I would not know how to step back actually
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Anyway, I feel I'm drawn to what may be F3. Yesterday, I tried to AP (Phasing), told my guides about my intention to meet them there. I immediately had a particular feeling I had never experienced so far before an attempt, felt like I was about to meet several good friends. You know, this kind of melted joy/apprehension/excitation you have when, on the way to a party, you look forward to pushing the door then hear your friends tell you "Hey !". I think this is a very good side-effect of changes occurring in my perception of Astral Projection, thanks to the forum. I also realized soon I was short of wakefulness, stopped at an intermediary state where my limbs seem to be "at a wrong place". Remembering what upstream said, I gave up Phasing and attempted to push myself upwards, without success. Anyway, I now know this is a matter of time and remaining calm.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the newsletter and good luck with Astral Projection Truth. Make it soon, I
<u>
 do
</u>
look forward to reading it !
<br>
<br>
upstream,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for those amazing details. I may say this is the first time I see such a physiologically-oriented description. What I find even more amazing in that during all those years I entered Fz without hearing any noise. Strong kinesthetic shifts yes, but never auditory things ! Yet,
<br>
that seems so common to many projectors...? As you say, "if your attention directed elsewhere you will not be aware of the noises". That must be the case for me. Even if my priority now is Phasing, I'd really like one day to hear these ones, just for experience and for the fun of it, but I don't know how to do. It happened to me to wake up with some weird sounds, but this never happened during a conscious meditation.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your replies,
<br>
<br>
Yours,
