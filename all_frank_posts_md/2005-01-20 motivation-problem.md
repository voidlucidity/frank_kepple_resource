<section>
I have some LD's from time to time but it needs quite some effort from my side to have them. I had 4 conventional OBE's so far. And I'm loosing me motivation to work on it.
<br>
Sometime I doubt if this experiences are real or just a fantasy and this further reduces my motivation to OBE. I don't want to think this way but I do
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
The LD's are fun but I want more then that! It is just not enough to keep me going. I want them to have a transforming effect! I want to grow.
<br>
Should I focus more an traditional OBE's ? What are your coolest Astral Experiences?
<br>
Can somebody please help me out of this hole?
<br>
<br>
Thanks Tom

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Maybe you are trying to hard? I just wondered because any kind of tension in the mind can have a detrimental effect. I think the medics call it Performance Anxiety, or something like that. Maybe you should try to relax more and go with your own flow. That's what I do. Just lay back and look within yourself and be happy with what comes about. Sometimes I think people make this far too complex, and they begin treading on their own feet. Sorry if this isn't much help, but it's just a thought that came to mind when I read your post.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Gruezi Tom!
<br>
<br>
Know exactly what you mean. I was at that point about two years ago and stopped my efforts altogether. And, of course, nothing happened anymore. Until I restarted earlier last year. Then everything picked up again, but my results were better, too. Maybe I just needed that time to cool off.
<br>
<br>
It is like Frank said: Working too hard at it and exerting pressure on yourself is counterproductive. Taking it easy and looking forward to the results seems to be the best policy.
<br>
<br>
Viel Glueck und alles Gute!

Hey Tombo,
<br>
<br>
Realize that you have a good track record over time. Take it easy, keep working at it, be patient and more experiences will follow. Just keep taking the steps and you will progress. Know this and then it will be worth it to persevere.

 Heightened Goals
</b>
<br>
After completing both the above basic goals of here-now and higher dimensional travel, try:
<br>
<br>
<u>
 1.                    Independently targeting here-now/physical world places and happenings to swap and compare independent reports
</u>
<br>
<i>
 <br>
 a.    The moon
 <br>
 <br>
 b.   Vacation spots
 <br>
 <br>
 c.    Movie theatres
 <br>
 <br>
 d.   Etc.
</i>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 2.                    Independently targeting higher dimensional places and happenings to swap and compare independent reports
</u>
<br>
<i>
 <br>
 a.    Akashic records
 <br>
 <br>
 b.   The Park
 <br>
 <br>
 c.    Higher Self level
 <br>
 <br>
 d.   Etc.
</i>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 3.                    To mutually/simultaneously target here-now and higher dimensional places for interaction, fun, and joint exploration
</u>
<br>
<i>
 <br>
 a.    Fun and companionship
 <br>
 <br>
 b.   Joint and group exploration
 <br>
 <br>
 c.    Further validation and independent journal cross-referencing for accuracy testing and skill refinement
</i>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 4.                    Collaborate with three or more projectors for added validation, experience, experimentation, and fun!
</u>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 5.                    Meet and interact with beings you meet in the out-of-body
 <br>
 <br>
 6.                    Develop physical world friends from out-of-body met acquaintances!!
</u>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Tips
</b>
<br>
<u>
 1.      Have a mutually clearly defined goal, and clearly defined things to validate (Robert Bruce/Dynamics) for effeciency, ease of execution, and economic use of energy
 <br>
 <br>
 2.      Repeat steps for developing 100% clear awareness if awareness and clarity ever slack, to retain clarity and to extend the experience
 <br>
 <br>
 3.      Stay in the moment- take breaks when needed, swap partners if desirable, switch locations as desired... keep it fresh!!
 <br>
 <br>
 4.      Communicate via phone (unless phone number is something to be swapped and validated), chat, email, letter, in person, etc., and discuss the experiment often, to foster and accelerate connection and success
 <br>
 <br>
 5.      Allow, accept, and even request assistance from your guides, guidance, your partner, and any helpful beings and spirits (your assistance may grab a wrist and pull, try to ram your out of body by flying into you trying to boost you out, etc.)
 <br>
 <br>
 6.      Be persistent and persevere- success may not be immediate, but still success is inevitable!

<section>
Thanks for the help so far. I actually don't think I'm pushing to strong rather the opposite. My routine pretty weak I would say:
<br>
-I do some reality check during the day
<br>
-I do some energy work
<br>
-I sometimes do affirmation to LD when falling asleep
<br>
-about all 14 days or so I do 40 minutes of OBE-exercises in Bed
<br>
So actually I think my routine is pretty moderate. O.k. maybe I should see it more as fun and not as something one should do, that might be a point a should work on but other then that, I don't think I'm forcing.$
<br>
That problem seems more to be that I do not have any real target that I want to accomplish.
<br>
I think if Somebody could like give a awesome target and say "Look try this if you succeed your motivation problem will be gone" or something that would help a great deal:
<br>
<br>
So I think Cezyl your post might do that job and help me get some motivation. I mean if I coul meet with a friend and we both could confirm the experience that would definitely boost my motivation!
<br>
<br>
Probably I should start to define some very clear goals! Any more ideas?

Hey Tombo...
<br>
<br>
I've partner OBE'd before. Nothing major, but enough to convince me that something is into this projection thing. I'll find the actual journal entries and post them at my site, or here- most likely both, but here's what happened in brief:
<br>
<br>
I was working with a master projector at the time, getting tips and such. I made for myself a robe with a gold ring around it and went astral with that on, but I got out only halfway fully conscious. Suffice it to say that I saw him that projection, and though I was drowsy in the projection I remember us talking. It seemed very like a dream, but I knew it was a projection- as perhaps all or most dreams are.
<br>
<br>
The next day or so we got on the phone again, and I didn't mention anything to him about the meeting. He opened that he saw me on the astral and we were talking, and told him that I was tired, and I looked to him to be drowsy. He said I had a big shirt on, making (light) fun of me.
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
It was fun. That's one of those times when I stood back and was like... whoa. PartneredOBE is powerful.
<br>
<br>
Another time I became conscious on the astral, and saw a friend/ex-girlfriend (yes, friend/ex-girlfriend- it's possible
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
) who I hadn't seen or spoken to in years. She was with three other people, a guy, and a girl and a guy. I went to talk to her. She seemed pretty conscious, as did them all. The guy she was with got jealous and pulled her away from me. I figured they were a couple, and the others were a couple. I called her up that next week or so, and we chit chatted. Then I told her I got out-of-body and saw her, and she was with a guy, and there was another girl and guy couple also. She mentioned none of her relations to me, and I hadn't seen her in years. She was shocked, and told me she has a boyfriend, and then her best friend has a boyfriend. All four of them travel together everywhere all the time, movies, eating, etc. She was shocked, and I was thoroughly tickled.
<br>
<br>
For now there is a person I am working with at a forum for this purpose:
<br>

</a>
<br>
<br>
He lives in Utah and I in Kentucky- we're meeting mid point in Kansas...
<br>
<br>
Take care. Just introduce yourself at the 'Partner Search' board and I'm sure someone will be along to partner with you.
