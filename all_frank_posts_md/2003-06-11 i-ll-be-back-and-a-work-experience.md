Hey you all.
<br>
<br>
You've probably noticed that I haven't been posting as regularly as I have been. (For those at Astral Society, I've just joined, so that may not be so applicable to you now.
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
) Thanks to the help of my guides I have combined my first four books, including a book I wrote two years ago inspired by and channeled of my guide Okanos, into one massive book. I want this one to be in print by October, so I have some massive proofreading and editing to do, besides some full-time OBE-ing and Astral-ing to fill in the rest of the experience/journal part of the book. Thus I'll be writing and astrally and etherically traveling hard, so I may not be on as much for the next few months or so.
<br>
<br>
Here is an experience I had at work Sunday as a potent morsel of inspiration. Enjoy. I'll see you again after crunch time- but I'm sure I'll pass through at least every once in a while between now and then.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Separation at work
<br>
6/7/2003 3:29 PM; Transferred from a shorthand account made at work, filled in.
<br>
<br>
12:35 PM
<br>
I was very sleepy at break. I was up late so was sleepy, and chose to take a nap at break. I couldn't get to sleep right away to I decided to engage the astral. Break started at 12 o'clock midday. I went to my workstation and sat at my desk, and put my arms down on my forearms. It took a while to find a comfortable position, but I ended up finding a nice and balanced position, which was comfortable enough to proceed. At first as I said I tried to go to sleep to get some rest, so that I could perform at work better, but sleep wasn't coming easily, so I decided to leave my body to let it sleep. I've decided to take a break from etheric/real-time travel for a while and engage the astrals more. I decided to visit the realm I created there, which I'll call MyPlace-There. (Explained in detail earlier in book.)
<br>
I envisioned the entrance to MyPlace-There, which is a desert region with a tetrahedron about a half a mile away from my entry point to the astral. I envisioned it, allowing my body to relax and drift to sleep, and as my body went to sleep and I inversely left it more and more, the realm become more and more concrete around me. I started to reach down and feel the sand, and look around, and center myself into MyPlace-There.
<br>
It got to a point to where I started to be there, and the transition that happens, happened. I was whisked away to an entry point directly by the tetrahedron, in the air to the side of it. I focused on how it usually looks- like a mini ancient Egyptian pyramid, but with only three sides and covered with a layer of dust and sand. I teleported back and forth, between the entry point by the pyramid, and the one a half-a-mile away. I steadily forgot about my physical body, and become more and more detached from it.
<br>
I entered the tetrahedron, this time separating the side of it so that a hole was available, and entered it to the dense darkness within- the void. I emerged downward into sky of the main aspect of MyPlace-There, looking down upon the island and crystal blue water, and my doko structure. I teleported back to the desert area, and reentered the pyramid several times, to solidify my hold there. After about the third teleportation and reentry I flew down to the island, stopping some 1000 feet in the air above it. At this point I was about 40% in my physical body, and 60% in the astral.
<br>
In a blur I flew down to the island, above and to the right of the doko, and then I whisked myself into it and landed on the floor, remembering my crystal floating in the center of the room. I remembered that I have been wanting to change the lower area, the sort of cave underneath the surface structure mimicking Moen's and TMI's Core Crystal area. I dove in and it still looked like an abandoned mine. I focused my awareness, jestering my hand up for aid, nd willed the area to change into a palace. The walls and floors melted to my will, and liquefied, but soon as I let go of my intense focus they belted back to their original state. Again I focused, envisioning the walls being a dark gold, like the inside of a palace worthy of a king. The matter of the realm resisted but could not withstand my will, and melted and reformed according to my new image for it. I noticed as I looked around that the places I wasn't directly focusing on had turned back already. I was looking around, applying my will, and each time I turned the other way the area behind my that I was not directly focusing on turned back. After several times of this I let it go and flew back to the floor level of my doko.
<br>
I decided to dive down again, and this time changing the area as I went. I dove into the hole under the crystal, and as I flew down the tunnel to the cave area I willed and envisioned the change. As I flew past, the crude dirt and rock turned into dark gold brick, which lined the tunnel downward as I went. I was Midas, and my mind was my touch.
<br>
When I entered the main area, above me was a vertical tunnel of dark gold brick, and I was now changing the main area until that of the interior of a castle. Before long though, as soon as I changed my focus, it warped back: "Whoomp!" It looks something how that sounds.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
I decided to try one more thing. (At this point I'd forgotten about my physical body.) I flew back up to the surface, and thinking about Neo from the Matrix and their effects I flew back down so that the entire level pulled with me. It looked something how it looks with Van Damne walked through time on Time Cop- how the space bent and came back like jelly-water. I pulled the energy-matter of the entire tunnel into a deep cone, more for fun that to change it- willing the environment to be in my fashion when I released it. I let it go and it swung back to normalcy, like it was originally. I'll find a way to change this area.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
In between the changing of the shape of MyPlace-There I shifted back to my physical body and observed the movement behind my eyelids. I was obviously in a good trance. I'd look at the visions, but then go back to my place, intending the tunnel. After I declared changing that tunnel a lost cause this time I stayed with the visions, and focused on them. There were shapes and images, and movement flowing before my eyes. They looked partially submerged in black syrup, rather than the thick black tar they have usually seemed submerged in previously. As I focused on them they got clearer and clearer.
<br>
As I was focusing on the imagery someone several aisles down started stapling. Each time he stapled (I knew it was a he.) I felt the waves of energy (sound) that emanated from it crash into my being. It caused vibration and reverberations through my entire being, and something like a minor shock. Every five seconds he'd staple, and the shock and reverberation would go through my aura. I was wishing, praying for this guy to stop stapling. I didn't want to get shocked out of my state, yet it was very interesting to perceive the effect of sound upon the nonphysical bodies- especially such a simple sound as a stapler being used. He continued stapling at a steady rhythm, and I braced for the impact of each staple. Ripples through my aura, reverberations of force, a feeling of impact upon the surface of my aura, vibrations through my etheric body, a slight electric shock- all simultaneously, each time he stapled. Finally one staple staggered in execution- seconds more behind the previous than the pattern that he was set in just moments before. Then he stopped stapling (whew!), and I went back to my practice.
<br>
I focused on the imagery again, and then it was as if my eyelids fell off. Without opening my eyes I was seeing as if they were open. I was seeing through my eyelids, seeing my arms, and the desk I was resting on. I could see the grain coloration of the wood. I saw a white card on the desk, and I knew one was not there physically. I presumed it may be one of my business cards- a thought-form of it- or a glimpse into the past of one being there, as I had one there before. Then I felt and heard two people coming by from my right. I could feel their energy and auras as they approached, and I heard them chatting- though I could not make out what they were saying. But I didn't try to make out what they were saying, focusing on how I could feel their auras and energies. The interesting part is, after I started focusing on them coming by, my visual changed so that instead of looking down upon my desk through my eyelids I was looking at them, as if I'd sat up and turned around. Yet I didn't move: my head was down and resting upon my forearm and hand, my eyes were closed, and I was facing toward the wall opposite the walkway. Yet I saw them as if sitting up and looking, though the perception was too blurry to make out exactly whom they were.
<br>
After they went by I decided to go back to the imagery. I looked into the area seemingly behind my eyelids, but was looking into an area of depth, with shapes and movement in the distance, all moving around and intermingling. As I focused on this all of a sudden I was moving through a tunnel. Gravity suddenly released and I was going through this tunnel at an amazing pace. I felt no body or form in particular, yet it was as if I was in my same position I was physically sitting in but with my head up and looking down the tunnel as I went. The tunnel was composed of streaks of purple, dark blue, and dark green streamers- like how the tunnel of stars looks when the starship Enterprise takes off on the show and movie Star Trek. These streamers were much thicker than that presented in the movie show, some 20 or 30 streamers around the entire tunnel.
<br>
After several seconds of speeding down this tunnel I caught my self and was back in deep trance, sitting on the chair- though I could not definitely feel the chair or my physical body, but more so perceived the environment, thus knowing where I was. Thinking of how neat that was I focused again, let go, and again I was whizzing down this same tunnel. Gravity released and then I was moving rapidly down this tunnel. After several seconds I again caught myself, and was back at my desk.
<br>
I started hearing commotion around me, and heard people coming back to work. I perceived Edward come back and walk to his desk, and I seemed to get a slight visual of him as he reached his desk- like a snapshot of what it may have looked like had I been physically looking. He well knows about my out-of-body skill, so I was tickled to think I was 'out' while he walked up.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I started to hear the rings of phones, and talking to customers, and knew the job was back up, so I ended there, and fully reintegrated with the physical, and sat up. Time was 12:33 PM.
<br>
<br>
*Very easy and good projection.
<br>
*It is definitely a good time to start refocusing on the astral.
<br>
*Had I been able to continue, I'm sure I would have been able to etherically project. J
<br>
*Was I etherically separated when I was seeing those girls walk by?
<br>
*Interesting experience with the stapler.
<br>
*Did I actually sit up in my mental body, like a previous highly ephemeral experience I had of somehow nonphysically sitting up to look at the clock?
<br>
*It is amazing the effects of sound on the nonphysical aspects of being. This sound experience confirms the dangers of loud music.

<section>
hi there darryl !!
<br>
<br>
thanks again for taking time to share your experiences here. I love the detailed descriptions.
<br>
<br>
I was wondering...just a few questions.
<br>
1) can you project at will (e.g. when you aren't feeling tired, or ready for a projection )? I guess that if the answer is yes, your success rate would be slightly less in these situations ?
<br>
<br>
2) have you ever experienced full conciousness in the physical, whilst simultaneously projecting ? I'm not sure if this is the same as RB's "mind - body split" terminology, i think its different.
<br>
<br>
cheers !
<br>
Mark
