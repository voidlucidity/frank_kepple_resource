I may be dreaming, but I am a strong believer that out of dreams, come reality.  I was wondering if anybody knew of any career positions that revolve around much of the topics discussed on this forum that would not only allow me to travel the world but would help me to secure a decent paycheck.  I am a 18 yr. highschool graduate that has plenty of dreams, and an insatiable love and curiousity for New Age thinking.  As I begin the second phase of my life, college, I fear that I might begin a career that may hold me back, socially as well as spiritually.  Any suggestions would be greatly apprecated.

The field of psychology usually deals with much of the topics discussed here.

Psychology huh.  When I think of that major I can't help but picture such a vague major that many of my friends say they're going into.  Could you possibly recommend a more narrow approach.  Also, can you think of any psychology jobs that pay well and allow me to travel around world. ( I know I'm not giving you much to work with, hehe). Thanx

Frank - Touche. I have grown to enjoy your wit.
<br>
<br>
ninthplanet - I think you have to mainly follow your own innner essence on this but to ask others advice surely shows wisdom. As for Psychology, I myself am quite ignorant but the small amount I've read I find interesting. I notice that astralc has combined his knowledge of psychology, astrology with knowledge of the tao. I would love to see the same done with psychology and western hermetics although  Dion Fortune comes to my mind for some reason. Perhaps you could refer to astralc on the benefits of psychology.
<br>
<br>
In regards to the US Army. I think that is a great experience but like anything it is what you make of it. I spent 4 yrs assigned with the 82abn, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment and it seems I learned more about myself and others than in the whole previous 23 years. A few of the more simple and obvious lessons: never speak bad or offensively of another human or anything they may identify with including their name, regiment (especially canadians), flag, nation or political leaders, religious beliefs or leaders, occupation, spouse, children or even the shoes they wear on thier feet. Why you ask? Well lets just say flags are like projected personality and ego, as soon as we raise them up the flagpole we are willing to defend them or attack others flying "different" colors, even to the point of physical death.
<br>
<br>
Second best lesson: an individual soldier is only a small part. Soldiers make a squad which together make a platoon, company, battallion, regiment. You eat, sleep, laugh, cry, suffer, triumph, live and die together. You realize these "others" and you are parts of something bigger. Great human analogy here but I didn't catch it until years later after losing alot of the brainwashing that was part and parcel of that experience.  Once I caught the precept of the inner-self, higher-self, oversoul, greater-self things have fallen together a bit. ninthplanet - imho you don't need the army. Take notice and save yourself 4 years of humping a rucksack and weapon for someone's "cause".
<br>
You are already a part of something far greater than a military regiment,  america or the european intelligencia... something perhaps even far greater than being human itself. The wisdom here is accepting others with no conditions for no other reason except that everyone you meet is a part of that same "something greater". Just do the best you can and walk your own path mate... that's all any of us are doing.
<br>
<br>
My best to all of you on your journey.
<br>
<br>
peace,
<br>

Thank you for the suggestion Frank, but I am not interested in the military.  For one, is does not allow me time to research and  look into New Age topics.  Second, I don't promote anyting that might involve killing.

Hello there,
<br>
<br>
I know this is pretty vague, but there is a university in southern California that has a parapsychology major. I had a friend that wanted to attend it. I I ever hear from him, I'll be sure to ask him where it is. I also know that there are some remote viewing institutes; perhaps there are some OBE ones too. Perhaps you could do a web search. I'm sure that university in CA is on it somewhere.
<br>
<br>
HTH,

I would think that Mr. Bruce might have knowledge on this since he has had experience in such fields. I wonder if we could get his attention to post some ideas. Atleast some place to start looking.
<br>
<br>
I hope you find what makes you happy and can give you a good living.

Thank you for the suggestion about the universities, I'll see what I can find.  If at all possible, I would like hear more about your friend and his career lifestyle.

yeah that'd be great, but I really have no way of contacting him, other than just by dumb luck.
<br>
<br>
I've been meaning to ask you, how far are you along with your projections and dimensional reach.  I myself have just started to read the book and begin the first exercise, Mobile Body Awareness, and I am quite excited about my results so far.  I would enjoy hearing from you.
