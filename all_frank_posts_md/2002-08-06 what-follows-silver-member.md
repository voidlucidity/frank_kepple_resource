It isn't really important, but it would be nice to know if there is some level after "silver member" with its three stars. If there is, how many posts does it take to reach?

I've wondered that myself. But we can probably as Cainam pretty soon. I think 500 seems a reasonable limit. 10 for regular, 100 for Silver, 500 for gold??

<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I have moved this topic here so that it can be discussed openly.
<br>
<br>
I will tell you that the maximum number of stars is 5, and that is achieved at 1000 posts.
<br>
<br>
Some people, notably Tom, are heading rapidly in that direction, and so I thought I would open this up to see what you members think a five star member should be
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
Logically we could call it the level "Platinum", but that sounds to me a bit like issuing credit cards after Gold
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;  As a matter of fact, the 5 star level is not called Platinum as it is now, I won't say what it actually is.
<br>
<br>
As 5 stars is the maximum attainable level of member, I thought it would be a good idea to see what you would prfer to be ranked as at that dizzy height, rather than decide for myself.
<br>
<br>
Possibilities are "Platinum", "Diamond", "Premier" etc. amd we need something that is in keeping with that sort of implication.
<br>
<br>
So lets here your suggestions, I will be watching! Better hurry up though - otherwise Tom will get there and trigger what it is set to already
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>

<section>
This suggestion may cause anarchy and/or the gnashing of teeth but why not let the person who gets to 1000 posts decide. It can be sort of a thank you to that person for contributing so much(not that the number of posts means anything but I think we can all agree that people like Tom contribute a great deal to this board). Anyway thats my suggestion.
<br>
<br>
Or, have a poll to decide 3 or 4 different titles and then have the person who gets to 1000 posts pick.

PostMaster for short!  Or is that sexist?  PostMistress?    I suppose we gals could just get over it.
<br>
<br>
And the color of the stars?  I, personally, like the color purple, it's verrrrrry cosmic.  Then, it would be like starting over, because new members are purple, yes?  Could keep everybody's egos in check

Would you Look at your mates and give a little Wink?

Would I come across as a girl needing a man ?

Or would I come across as just Feminine?

Does it realy matter what colour  it does be?
<br>
Does it matter if it is given to a He or a She?
<br>
No-one has offended me on this site thus so far,
<br>
so to me who ever recieves it first,well it does not matter who they are.

I think 1000 posts should get something like "platinum member." Or something after some extremely rare and valuable substance. Or how about "executive member?" Something that represents a very high position. I don't believe I have seen anyone with this level of posts. And I think they should get some sort of cool prize in the mail, like a button with little flashy lights that says "Congratulations! You are now a [insert chosen word here] member!"

<section>
While I am at work, most of my attention is neither needed nor wanted. The connection to the internet is not bad, either. It is too easy for me to come to the forums and just check every so often for things which would be interesting to respond to. It was not necessary to artificially inflate my posting just to get high numbers. Actually, I am slowing down. It just doesn't show. What bothers me is that it does not feel like I am getting any closer to actually getting out of body. My guess is that there are a lot of people like me who come here and do not learn to go out of body. My guess is that most of these people stop coming back.

Greetings Everyone,
<br>
<br>
Well Tom is getting ever closer to the 1000 post mark and 5 stars.
<br>
<br>
The offer is still open to let members decide what the title should be.
<br>
<br>
My preference is "Premier Member". We could go with "Platinum Member" but it begins to sound a bit like credit cards

Greetings Everyone!
<br>
<br>
Well Tom is a mere 12 posts away from 1000 now - and so a decision needs to be made about this.
<br>
<br>
The choice needs to be sensible, amusing that many of the suggestions have been, and so far we have:
<br>
<br>
Premier Member
<br>
Platinum Member
<br>
Diamond Member
<br>
<br>
I prefer Premier Member myself.
<br>
<br>
Anymore suggestions? Better make it quick - Tom is a couple of days away at most

Why does the choice need to be sensible?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
For God's sake! Expand your horizons! Exercise your free will! Don't be constrained by convention! We can create whatever we like!
<br>
<br>
In that spirit, letting the member decide for him or herself seems most appropriate.  I'd personally vote for something along xehupatl's line of suggestions for myself, I like "Chakrator.".
<br>
<br>
"Postmaster general" received the most votes (I counted 7.) If that is too weird, it could be abbreviated to simply "P. G."  It's really no more nor any less meaningful than "Premier member." But a hell of a lot funnier.

Yeah, i like a fun name better:)
<br>
<br>
Like postmaster general, or instead of a name it could be a description like "One whom posts alot" or something like that.
<br>
<br>
In the meanwhile......... Tom, hold off posting until we can make up our mind will ya?

The 1000 post mark will be coming soon. It is only a matter of a couple of days at the current speed. The program itself probably has some sort of description at 1000 posts. If we don't like it, we can change it later. What I look forward to is not a title. It is the change in number of stars.

I have two purple stars, i used to have a green one, and before that none, and before that i was a guest! I liked the green star, it looked good. My favourite colour is green, also blue.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening.
