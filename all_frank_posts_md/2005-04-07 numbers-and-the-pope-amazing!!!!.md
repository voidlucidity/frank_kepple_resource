<section>
On the beginning I must appologize if I translated something wrong...the original is in Polish and I'm not a Catholic.
<br>
<br>
The date of Pope's death: 02.04.2005 -&gt; 2+4+2+5= 13
<br>
The hour of Pope's death: 21:37 -&gt; 2+1+3+7= 13
<br>
It's the 13th week of the year 2005
<br>
He was the pope for 26 years and 5 months -&gt; 2+6+5= 13
<br>
Which is 9301 days -&gt; 9+3+0+1= 13
<br>
On the 13th of May there was an assacination attemt on him
<br>
He was 85 years old -&gt; 8+5=13
<br>
Karol Wojty?a was chosen to be the Pope when he was  58 years old..again, it's 13.
<br>
He was the 265 Pope - again 13 and most importantly: (now I'm really sorry for the translation)
<br>
13th is the "day of apperances of Mary", to which John Paul II dedicated his entire life.
<br>
13 is "the Mary number"..(sorry again)
<br>
So

Something big has ended too! Now it's time for change... The church lost a great man... For some of no importance, for others a holy, but his death undoubtedly influences all of us!

And if you add 3 and 1 together you get 4.
<br>
<br>
4 means death in Chinese.
<br>
<br>
You can find meaning in anything if you look for it...

I def. believe something is coming. humanity cant walk down this path of science vs. religion much longer before something is proven or some landmark discovery is made.
<br>
<br>
PS. That is not to say that there havnt
<b>
 been
</b>
landmark discoveries made yet, you just havnt heard of them.

<br>
<br>
PSS. I also agree with Selski, you could probably divide the number of diarrhea the pope has taken by 1322 and youd get 13. i wouldnt dwell on it too long

Hannah:
<br>
<br>
I don't mean to sound like I'm getting on your case, but the problem with this kind of stuff is you need to balance it out with all the other dates or numbers, or whatever, that did NOT add up to 13. There must be zillions.
<br>
<br>
It's like the bog standard joke about the lucky number 7. I bet on the 7th horse in the 7th race of the 7th day of the 7th month... and it came 7th.
<br>
<br>
It's just that you can create all manner of things that add up. Everyone has wisdom in hindsight. I can tell you (after the event) what added up to what with amazing 100% accuracy... but so can everyone else!
<br>
<br>
The technical term is "curve fitting". It's a well known statistical concept.
<br>
<br>
It's like where you say on the 13th of May there was an attempt on his life. So in the same vein as the previous data... 1+3+5 = 9. Err, that's not 13. But the context in which the date is placed changes in order to make it "fit". That, of course, is curve fitting.
<br>
<br>
He was the Pope for 26 years 5 months 4 days and 17 minutes... 2+6+5+4+1+7 = 25.
<br>
<br>
He was 85 years 3 months 7 days 10 hours and 44 minutes old... 8+5+3+7+1+0+4+4 = 32.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in your example, the actual resolution of the data, or the terms upon which data are compared is changing from case example to case example. This brings in another very well-known "fudge" concept called, cherry picking.
<br>
<br>
It's where you only select certain results that fit your outcome criteria and basically ignore the rest that don't!
<br>
<br>
Again, I don't want to be seen like I'm stomping on your case but...
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

So sorry everyone for posting things that are not true, my intentions were good, but ofcourse that doesn't mean that the outcome had to be positive.

I must admit, I'm quite surprised at the number of replies to this post that discount the importance of numbers. Don't get the wrong idea, I don't live my life by looking at the numbers of everything that cross my path each day, but if you pay attention to numbers you may find some interesting patterns. I personally have a lot of 7's and 10's in my life. My house number, the exit number to get to my house, my pin number, all add up to 7, and this is just a small sample of the 7's in my life. I don't necessarily know what it means, but I think it may be a piece of the puzzle we're all fascinated with.
