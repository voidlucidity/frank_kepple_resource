<section>
I have been trying HARD over the past week to have an astral projection, Jesus H. Christ it's tough. I've been doing energy work for the lesser part of two years now, by energy work I mean daily NEW exercises and occasional meditation, but my interest in it started to wane after first hearing about it. With the end of the cross country season, a large amount of time that was spent running hard and running slow and running fast and all that jazz has been made available, which could explain my increased interest.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my first question relates to the act of projecting itself: While projecting, I have been able to enter into a light trance quickly and easily, but my problem lies in maintaining the proper focus and concentration to "climb the rope". I begin to climb, and start to feel my astral body loosen, with some accompanying light vibrations, but then the surface thoughts rear their ugly heads and I become distracted and lose it;by that point I am usually so frustrated that I decide any further effort would be for naught. Does anybody have any suggestions on exercises/training I could do to improve my focus?
<br>
<br>
My second question does not relate to projection so much as spiritual development. What are the ramifications and effects of pornography and masturbation on a person's spiritual/energy development and how can one kick such a habit/addiction? I know that Mantak Chia has said that each time a person ejaculates they lose a large portion of their life energy that can never be regained, but, with all due respect, I believe this to more or less be bovine excrement. Just take a look at Hugh Hefner

holy crap ! I hope I dont lose my energy from ejaculation... that would explain my failed attempts... hrrmf... hehe,  Well , I would have to agree with you that it has to be bull****.  I mean , thats insane..
<br>
<br>
About question number one
<br>
<br>
, "Does anybody have any suggestions on exercises/training I could do to improve my focus?"
<br>
<br>
I would suggest tryinga different technique other than rope ? Theres a whole bunch of other things.  Rope has never really worked for me and it may be cause of the same reason that your havin trouble with it .. heres a good site to try for other techinques.

The only thing you can do is continue practising. I know exactly the point you mean and it took me months, and loads and loads of attempts, to reliably get through this stage. I don't know why, exactly, but there appears to be some element of your protective sense of conscious awareness that "snatches you back" just as the process is kicking in. Which is very frustrating. But do keep at it because you will overcome this problem given time.

Rule Number One, dont push yourself. This is a natural process, and i think a sense of urgency or a feeling pf "i have to do this", might hinder your attempts. THat being said, also remember that the least amount of distractions you have the better. SOme good advice i have given in the past is a process I call "Sensualization". This means you basically arrange what your senses will be doing during your projection attempt.
<br>
1. Sound. One of the most distracting things for OBE for me is getting interruppted by some loud noise. You could wear sound damping earphones, or use a brainwave generator. What i do is time my projections to whne things are at the quietest.
<br>
2. Sight. Well, this is the easiest for me. I just close my eyes and im ready to go. And i ALWAYS make sure there is light source in the room so i dont project out to complete darkness.
<br>
3. Smell. I burn "Nag Champa" incense, the stuff in the blue box. Its very pleasing to me, and helps me get in the right mindset to attmept a projection.
<br>
4. Taste. Not really a big deal, but could be a distraction if you just ate. I usually brush my teeth so im not thinking about it.
<br>
5. Touch. The most important in my mind. This is my pre-projection routine. I massage my feet, hands, head, arms and legs. And i make sure im wearing loose fitting comfortable clothes.
<br>
hope this helps!

<section>
Thanks for all the responses. Allow me to expand upon my first question a little further. When I start to "climb the rope", my vision is dark, as if my eyes were closed normally. However, as I climb higher and higher and my astral body loosens, my vision gradually turns lighter and lighter until I see white, and my body feels very light (no vertigo/vibrations, however). It is at this point I run out of mental juice, and my concentration starts to wander from climbing the rope. I also have difficulties in NOT visualizing the rope; I guess I'm a pretty visual person, since I can close my eyes and see anything I want to if I concentrate hard enough.
<br>
<br>
So, does anybody have any tips on how to climb the rope, or how to go about imagining it? I usually imagine a rope dangling in front of me, but I have also imagined the end of the rope being attached to my solar plexus chakra and climbing up it as if I were climbing a 45 degree slope, but I haven't had too much success with the latter. Please note that so far, all my attempts have been while sitting down. Thanks again.

I say go cold turkey! delete *.jpg , *.gif, *.mpg, *.avi, *.everything else porn media related.
<br>
<br>
If your right handed, then tie your right hand behind your back for a period of 2 weeks. Don't even try it with the ol' leftie, it'll be more annoying then anything else...
<br>
<br>
No seriously, it's like any other addiction. Change habits, friends (if applicable), and replace it with something, like, sewing.
<br>

Take care

According to Robert in Astral Dynamics, it's good to have sex before projecting, as it relaxes you. Pent up sexual energy will have a negative, distracting effect on projection attempts. There's nothing wrong with sex, even if you go solo, as it is only human nature. (Truthfully, it's helped me project for the exact same reason).

It is probably more important how you spend the other 23 or so hours a day rather than the minutes spent masterbating(unless you spend hours on it!)

I was just practicing the rope technique a couple hours ago after having a long swim, and I achieved the much-talked about point where my heart chakra was pumping away like crazy.. I felt really light, had some minor vibes (I don't really feel that many vibes any more or pay much attention to them since I do so much energy work), and I could swear that I was on the edge of projection. I think I must be pretty damn close to getting it right. Once again, thanks for all the info/support.

<section>
Hi all. Like you, I have spent a lot of time climbing that rope, unable to get past a certain point, and I also find it hard to not visualise the rope, and in addition a part of me is always wondering what to do with my legs! But earlier this week something changed. I shifted my awareness from within my head to a point in front of my brow chakra, and immediately things began happening. Tingling, vibrations, floating, and clarity. I did not consciously project, but it's the closest I've come for a long time. So maybe the key is to shift our attention from a mind "within" the body to a mind external to the body.
<br>
<br>
Re the other question, the problem with porn is that it reduces people to mere physical bodies, (although some of them are pretty attractive). We are beings of spirit, and by focussing on the material we are getting caught in glamour and illusion. Spiritual development for me is about self-acceptance, and if there is a part of us that enjoys porn and masturbation, then the best thing we can do is accept it and even explore that side of ourselves. Eventually the mind gets bored, and then we can explore the potential of retaining our sexual energy for other purposes.

<b>
 Masterbation
</b>
<br>
<br>
When I started to investigate spiritual matters, I discovered in my search that masturbation could be a drain on subtle energy.
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that it may or may not hinder OBEs. Obviously some people project easily while still pleasuring themselves.
<br>
<br>
What I was learning concerned spiritual Work and the Tantric tradition. The goal there being to store as much energy as possible. Drains could be masterbation, getting really angry and lashing out. These are concerned with the lower chakras and drain the energy system there. The ultimate goal is to raise Kundalini energy, the coiled serpent, up, through the chakras, to the crown chakra resulting in full enlightenment.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if enlightenment is every OBEers goal but if it is, all the energy one can conserve would be in the best interest of the goal. I somehow think it's very personal. Different people have different makeups. I think that having an OBE, being consciously out of your body, is akin to a glimpse into eternal life, pretty cool eh? Is that not close to enlightenment itself?
<br>
<br>
As for addiction, yes, sex can be an addiction. The secret, I think, is to first accept it and not fight it. It will always win. Just watch it, observe yourself doing it and then you'll get an outside, objective viewpoint and if storing energy and not leaking it is your goal then it becomes easier not to. Also, you'll note dramatic energy surges when you deny yourself, if you can handle them. That is obvious proof that we're dealing with a most potent energy resevoir.

As an addition to the whole sex = energy topic, I just finished reading the book 1984, and in it, sex is frowned upon and repressed for the purpose of focusing one's entire energies on serving "Big Brother", as the totalitarian government in that book is called.  Now that I think about, when I have abstained from sex or masturbation, I have noticed definite increases in my energy level, so I suppose that abstaining from any sexual activity, or, perhaps some kind of tantra, would be in one's best interest if they wished to pursue enlightenment. I wonder what Robert would have to say about all of this?
<br>
<br>
By the way, I recently purchased Astral Dynamics, and I most highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in OBE; the thing is practically an astral traveller's bible.
