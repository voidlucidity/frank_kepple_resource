Hi
<br>
<br>
After finding out that my Dad regularly projects, I naturally wanted to ask him a few things that I was curious about. I found out that apparently you are attached to your body with some kind of silver rope. Is this the case for any of you who project too? I read also that the prophets claim to have been in some kind of sleeping form when receiving their messages from God and that they claimed to be attached to their body with a silver chord.

Yes, let us not forget the faimed "silver chord". It is a belief construct that people engage within due to the fact that we tend to become body fixated. There is no actual need for it. It's just mental reinforcement that's all.

Hi Nikk
<br>
<br>
Some people experience the silver cord.  Some don't.  I spent a few of my OBEs in the early days trying to find mine - to no avail (I didn't believe in it for starters - so that's probably why I didn't find it.)
<br>
<br>
Although there was one memorable OBE where I couldn't get any further than the end of the bed - I sensed I was attached to my physical body by a very thick rubber band.  The band was as taut as it would go.  After struggling for a while, I eventually gave in and let myself be zapped back to the physical.
<br>
<br>
As Frank says, it depends on what you believe.
<br>
<br>
However, there are times when my expectations are not met (I'm zooming along, about to go through a wall, and I smack right into it).  These are puzzling occasions, because I
<u>
 know
</u>
I can go through walls.
<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, talking about walls, I was at lunch yesterday with my work colleagues.  None of them know about my "abilities" and we were talking about Harry Potter, and the wall at Waterloo Station.  We were wondering if any children had actually attempted to go through the wall by running at it at 100 mph.  I laughed along, and thought to myself just how
<b>
 <i>
  amazing
 </i>
</b>
it is what I am able to do.
<br>
<br>
I guess being part of this website, projecting becomes "normal", and it was nice to be reminded yesterday just how magical it is.
<br>
<br>
I wished I could have told them - but sometimes you know it's not the right thing to do.  There are people who I know it's OK to tell - and people it isn't.
<br>
<br>
I'm going off on a tangent here - so I'll stop!

No Sarah, keep on going because I feel the same way.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I can't talk to anyone I know. They'd think I was weird or something.
<br>
<br>
4 days ago I projected and saw my body for the first time. Usually when I get out of my body I don't turn back to look at it. But I did this time and when I saw myself I said "COOL!" I didn't see any silver chord though.
<br>
<br>
The day after that, I was astral projecting, but I actually thought I was in my real body because everything felt too real and when I looked at my bed I didn't see a body so I figured that I had just fallen out of my bed onto the floor and got back in the bed. Then next thing I know I wake up and realized that I missed a good thing.
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
I hadn't had an OBE  that real in a while.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday I was stuck in my body. My body was lying on it's right side. My astral self tried SO hard to get out but couldn't. I even rolled over on my stomach and tried to push myself out with my arms but I was STILL stuck. I was SO mad.
<br>
<br>
Today I was able to project but I think I might've been in a semi lucid dream while projecting. I went through the whole noise thing and felt myself floating in darkness then I landed on the floor. I don't know who's room I was in though. I think it was my room but it didn't look like my room. Anyway, I got up (though I saw myself in the 3rd person until I got up) then I went to my dresser to pick up my class ring (I had been trying to get to that thing while projecting for a week now but never able to make it) and when I picked it up I was so happy. I saw a clock that said 9:24 and I put my ring back down and started jumping up and down with excitement shouting "I made it! I made it!"  but then I started to feel myself leaving and my physical body waking up. I was like "Nooooo!!" because I wanted to stay and practice some more exercises. I tried to make a ball of fire in between my outstretched hands and I think I saw an orange flash but then I woke up.
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
I looked at the time and it said 10:24. I was an hour off. In my time zone at least.
<br>
<br>
I'm getting better at willing these OBEs though. I was getting frustrated for a bit though because I was able to do it 2 days in a row 2 weeks ago, then hardly anything last week beyond feeling my astral arms and legs disconnect, but this week I've done it four days in a row though my projections this week aren't as long as the ones I had 2 weeks ago.

<section>
Wow, that is so cool! Thanks for sharing it with me. I haven't projected yet, but I'm even more determined to do so now. I can't wait until i finally do.
<br>
<br>
I know how you must feel when with other people, when you want to talk to them about it and tell them what you can do, but you know they'll think you're a complete nutcase. That's why I think Dad kept it from me for so long. I can imagine this situation at school. However, me and my friend Leon do believe in it, he has been trying for some months now and we talk about it a lot at school. He has been looking at these forums and has found it very useful.
<br>
<br>
By the way, is there anywhere on this forum where I can read about different techniques into having an OBE? I have tried getting to the vibrational state, but it felt more like rocking, almost dizzy. I want to read about any other ways in which to do it, I'm really interested.

Uhh..... you ARE kidding right?  Check out the faq's section, permanent topics section, and look for sticky post at the top of each area in the forum.  Read everything by Frank and other moderators.  That will keep you busy for the next 3 months.

The silver cord may well be a belief construct as Frank says.  I have only ever seen it once and it wasn't a cord.  It was a kind of shiny ribbon, about 4cm wide, coiling and and wafting about by my side. I grabbed hold of it and wafted it around.  At the time I didn't realise the significance of this strange item, and was actually a bit annoyed by it because it was interfering with my movement.  I was a few feet away from my physical body at the time, and facing it.  When I moved out of the room the ribbon disappeared...

<section>
The whole cord thing yes...there are many peeps whom have had ndes and claimed to have seen such a thing, bear in mind most of these folk have never heard about such a thing.
<br>
Same thing with my cousin, who had a spontaneous obe in which he saw a cord, I assume he has never read or heard about it, than if its a belief thing, how can people whom have never read or heard about such a cord still see one?
<br>
<br>
just a question thats all.

That's right, the whole chord thing, it is an internal question. An issue each individual faces on their terms. It's not a "mass belief" (religious) issue.

Now I almost feel guilty studying something for years, that even doesn't exist. Anyway, at first I too was thinking it's just a symbol, but nevertheless I got hooked. Later I read some articles that was totally in line with my experiences, so I could say with total conviction, the silver chord is not much more a belief construct than your guts are, for example. Just because you have never experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
<br>
<br>
As far as I know there are at least three factor that have to meet within a single dream in order to enable you to perceive the silver chord. First, you have to have an OBE-like dream, that is, starting dreaming by having the feelings of separation from the sleeping body. Secondly, the experience needs to be "etheric." In a typical "etheric OBE" you're blind and have difficulties with moving away from your body. Thirdly, you have to be observant enough not just crawling away in a hustle. You have to try to figure out what causes the pull that impede your movements. By simply turning back and probing around with your dream hand you could get the dream interpretation of the pull as a chord like organ.
<br>
<br>
In my experiences (as in many others) it appear like a smooth, rubber like cable, somewhere between 2 and 5 cm in diameter, connected to the solar plexus slightly outflaring. If I place my hand on it my hand moves toward my sleeping body (which I couldn't see in this state). I'm blind in this state but able to hear noises from the waking world in a distorted, sometimes echoed form while the cable excerts a strong and somehow ruthless pull on my dream body rendering it to a weigh less puppet. For some reason it's very tempting to give up the attempt in this state, however, the pull decreases quickly by distance, and eventually no superhuman will be needed for the escape.
<br>
<br>
I've noticed that the cable's attachment point has the tendency to move upwards by time and distance. Actually, the solar plexus cable is just the first recognizable shape of an amorphous flow that appear below the navel at separation. It's made by a bunch of rubber like tiny filaments embedded in a honey like mass and made separation very difficult. Later it shifts upwards, becomes narrow and turn into the shape of a cable at the level of the solar plexus. I will either fall forward out from the pull or having the connection point move further upwards. When it reaches the upper part of the chest on the dream body, I get ordinary dream vision and found myself in a state quite similar to the previous case.
<br>
<br>
After the attachment point reaches my neck the cable doesn't seem to be real anymore. Satisfying all my expectations and slowly changing its shape as one of the ordinary dream pictures could remain for a while though. The dreaming mind just couldn't let go of something so easy that was perceived. In this state I can bend it, rip it apart or even eat the cable. This is, I suppose, how most projector experience it. At first, it appears at the periphery of their awareness yet they don't realize its presence consciously because they are not observant. Other parts of their mind, however, does and made the cable part of the dream after REM start.
<br>
<br>
There are other types of the chord, more thinner, that usually doesn't connect to the body's middle line but rather has to do something with greater muscle groups. A couple of times after I have woken up from such an experience found groups of twitching muscles in my arm, right at the place where the thin cables was connected to my dream body. I think the cable is both a dream interpretation of a regressive flow that save the displaced bioplasm back to the organism and the lacing point of the somatosensory phantom through it protrudes from the inner representation of the body. This state is made possible by the faulty work of the neuromatrix, a functional unit of the brain that responsible for the generation of the internal body image. Coupled with the brain resistance for changing arousal, these things are deeply interconnected and may appearing in dreams as "silver chord."
