<section>
I am currently looking for a book to read relating to astral projection. I will be sure to buy Frank's book the day of it's release but in the meantime I am shopping around and looking for the best of the best.
<br>
<br>
I would like to buy a book that stays away from the spiritual side of the astral world as it only confuses me.
<br>
<br>
If anyone has any ideas as to what book is the best read please let me know.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I would recommend the two Monroe books Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey and two Seth books, Seth Speaks and The Seth Material. Jane Roberts gets a little tiresome in parts and grates on the nerves, and Monroe lets slip a little in places. Apart from that I can vouch for the material's accuracy. My experience largely concurs with both authors' work.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Why do you guys fear Spirituality? The way I see Spirituality it is Life!
<br>
Life = Spirituality!

Adventures Beyond the Body by Buhlman is quite good from what I read so far.

I have read all 3 Monroe books and I will vouch for them, as well. The last 2 (which are the ones that Frank mentioned) are different from the first and are more phasing oriented. This should help give you a good foundation for terminology and such.
<br>
<br>
I have never read any Seth books, mainly because I am do not like the whole channeling idea (seems ripe for frauds). Has anybody else read the 2 Seth books that Frank mentioned?

I have ordered the last 2 books as I am a new fan of phasing. I have been trying to project for over a year with no success and I am making quick progress with phasing.

I ended up ordering the two Seth books. Hopefully I will enjoy them and maybe post a review in the book section.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I appreciate your concern regarding the fraud aspect and some of the "channeled" stuff I have read just makes me laugh. It is just people channeling aspects of their own self from Primary Focus 2 of consciousness thinking they are in touch with "aliens" from outer space and all that jazz.
<br>
<br>
But the two Seth books I read I can vouch for their accuracy. Too much concurs with my own experience, particularly in the way Seth talks about the structure of consciousness. When I first read the books it was a revalation to me as hardly a page went by that didn't qualify something or other from my own experience. Although, again, Jane Roberts gets more than a little tiresome in places. But I suppose it was the 1960's or whenever.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank as a humbled master, not even pointing to his own book in the works.
