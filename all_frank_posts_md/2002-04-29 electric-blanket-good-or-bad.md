Would like to hear experiences with trying to project while under an electric blanket.
<br>
Do these electric fields prevent OBE's ?  Do we get stuck to them?
<br>
How about ceiling fans above the bed, or electrical wires in walls behind the
<br>
headboard.  I moved into a new house and the bedroom has 480 volt circut
<br>
breakers just 10 inches from my head, on the other side of the wall.
<br>
<br>
If anyone has experiences with electric or magnetic fields, what do they do
<br>
to the astral body?  Do they attract or repell us
<br>

I have an all-night electric blanket that I leave on during winter-time as I do not have the central heating on in the bedroom. I leave the window open slightly to get plenty of fresh air. Which means the room can often get quite chilly, hence the need for the electric blanket. In the summer the blanket is switched off and I have air-conditioning to keeep the room cool. None of these electrical devices, I found, affect my ability to obe.
