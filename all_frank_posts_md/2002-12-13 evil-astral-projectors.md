I was recently talking to a man who served a prison sentence for attempted murder.  The topic of OBE's came up and I asked him if he was familiar with the term/experience.  He told me that the only time he had ever really heard anyone talk about it was from another convict.  He said the guy was a very intelligent psychopath who I believe he said was in for murder.  He told me the guy could have conscious projections.
<br>
<br>
This brings up an important question that I have long pondered: How much contact with the astral do very evil people have.
<br>
<br>
If there is duality/opposition in all aspects of existence then obviously if there are spiritually advanced persons such as Robert Bruce, then wouldn't there be very evil counterparts?  Arch-enemies to peace loving projectors.  The terminology here is kind of hoky (even the term OBE is really kind of funny when you break down the elements of existence and inter-dimensionality, etc.) but I still wonder.

It does not seem all that odd to me.  It seems logical that ANYONE can do this despite thier moral convictions.  It all depends on thier point of view.
<br>
<br>
Why would a person have to be considered good and or pure in order to have lots of contact with the astral?   It is just that normally a person who lives a life of crime is more controlled by thier physical paranoya's that it would be extreamly difficult for them to project at a concious level.  You know too dependant on the physical.

The lower Astral is populated by millions and millions of what we incarnates would consider "evil people". They continue to play the same mindless games on the Astral that they played while Physical. As such, every shade of evil that is present on the Physical is also present within the lower Astral.
<br>
<br>
The good news is, these people by their very nature self-limit their development (not that they perhaps would perceive it that way). Basically, within the Astral like attracts like. So someone who liked murdering people would naturally be attracted into regions populated by murderers. Which is, of course, where it gets interesting.
<br>
<br>
It is only when you learn to project into these areas and have the ability to remain detached (so you don't get wrapped up in the drama and begin releasing emotion yourself) that you learn the true definition of the phrase Poetic Justice.
<br>
<br>
So murderers, for example, are entirely at liberty to seek out new victims... but at the same time, others of the same disposition are all around them doing exactly the same.
<br>

From personal experience, "evil" or evilly motivated people can project. Projection can be accomplished with different aids. It is used to attempt to corrupted and manipulate people in the physical. I am sure the poetic justice catches up at some point, but there are issues now. The  (sort of) good news would be that the majority of people that are intelligent enough to project, and misguided enough to do evil usually have a plan for the most part, and are not random with their actions.

I think my initial question was a little misleading...I know that anyone and everyone can project (and they do probably every night) but I am wondering how many of the really sick, twisted people...especially really talented/intelligent people, project and use this and other psychic abilities to their dubious advantage.

Another thing I once heard is that quite a few of music artists who produce really dark, heavy "satanic" music often rely on "evil" astral experiences as well as lucid dreams to channel some of the stuff they produce.  I guess it's just interesting to note that people can use any natural ability to do either good or evil.
