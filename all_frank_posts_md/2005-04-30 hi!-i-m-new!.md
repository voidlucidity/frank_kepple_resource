 Hi everybody!  I'm new here and I just wanted to share a little about myself.  My name is Krystina but I like to go by Krys.  I've been researching extraordinary abilities since January 2005.  I usually hang out on Dream Views and that's where I got the link to this place.  I'm really looking forward to making friends.  BTW, I can't astral project but I am really good at lucid dreaming.

 In fact, I've been lucid dreaming all my life.  At first, I thought that everyone could control what was happening in their dreams and then I went to Dream Views and found out that it was a special ability that many people don't have and because of that don't believe in it.

 I'm sooo sorry!  My favorite color in the whole world is orange so that's why I typed in that color.  Is this better?
 <br>
 <br>
 BTW, I like orange better than indigo...

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thats better, I thought my eyes had gone fuzzy for a moment. :)
<br>
<br>
Yeah, orange is a good colour. Reminds me of the setting sun.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
