hi!
<br>
<br>
let's see how you people can handle some truth...
<br>
<br>
according to this website and many others astral traveling is a way to explore REAL world and not your subconscious. is it really? try something next time you travel. take a deck of playing cards, shuffle it, close your eyes and draw a card. put that card on a table (or elsewhere) face up, but don't look at it. and now travel away! once you are tuned to your "astral body" take a look at that card. can you see what it is? when you are back in your physical body compare what you saw in the astral world with what it really is. YOU WILL NOT GUESS THAT CARD!
<br>
<br>
just face it, this "astral traveling" is nothing but a controlled dream. sure it's fun. hey, it's definitely healthier than acid! but astral body is not real and all you see when you travel is the creations of your mind. there is no other dimensions, there is no god. the reality is made of hard work and lies. face it, be strong!
<br>
<br>
wait, my astral body foresees a lot of negativity coming in response to this thread (hehe). let me emphasize some key points here.
<br>
<br>
1) try the experiment. if you guess the card it will be a final proof to yourself and others that astral traveling is real.
<br>
<br>
2) don't weasel out, try the experiment! stop making up excuses!
<br>
<br>
3) seriously, try this experiment. if you can't see the card - you can't see your body from outside and you can't see anything else. it's all made up.

Oh well. I guess the people who have seen me whilst OBE (who had no knowledge of my AP interests) on many occasions must be experiencing a shared hallucination with me. You have shown me the light. We were all dreaming. oh well.

Okay, why don't we turn that round?
<br>
<br>
Instead of basing your opinion on ignorance and hearsay, and dismissing anything contradictory as lies, why don't YOU just learn how to project, and try the experiment yourself?
<br>
<br>
It's interesting to me that so many 'scientific' people feel qualified to dismiss something out of hand that they've never experienced. It's a highly unscientific approach.

That would be a possibility but the people who have seen me when OBE where either not in the same room or on occasion the same building. The reason I discovered they had seen something is because I usually questioned them in the pretense of having a strange dream (Not wanting to divulge such a strange interest.)
<br>
I would usually project and visit someone (documenting the time) and later when checking with the people I visited, on more than one occasion, the person actually saw something strange at that time too.
<br>
An example being when I was OBE and decided to try and pull a female friend OBE too, I wasnt sure if this was possible at the time. In my experience she did go OBE and I showed her how we could move through walls and float. I spoke to her the morning after-wards stating my experience as a 'weird dream' that I'd had.  She froze on me and acted strangely towards me for the rest of the day. Later I bought up the subject again and she told me that she woke up in the night and found a figure bending over her bed reaching towards her, the figure was made of 'black smoke' in her words and she could see through it. She has no interest in the paranormal, or even religion or spiritual subjects, and she has never had an experience which could be called paranormal before or since (in her words.)
<br>
The times of my OBE and her strange experience were the same.
<br>
<br>
I have no explanation for the experience, and more was going on than talking in my sleep
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
And I have no idea how a shared hallucination would work with a friend who I hadn't spoken to for a while in a separate location.
<br>
This is just one experience of many which has led me to believe more is going on than dreaming. I do try to be very objective where OBE is concerned. Also when questioning the person I visited I am careful not to use leading questions, or plant the seed of something strange happening at a certain time.
<br>
I don't expect you to believe what I say, but that's OK as I know it happened.

<section>
lol have you even read a book on astral projection Ive read astral dynamics and Robert Bruce actually says that the way to prove AP is real is to take a card, stick it against a window, go and project, go through the window, look at it then come back, remember it, go check it out and then you'll know.
<br>
So now we've got selski and Robert Bruce proving that the card trick works, and I'm certain that almost all projectors try this trick and it works, id say thats 2-1 to us Anton1, you lose

<section>
the reason why i don't believe in AP is not because i know AP is not real. it is because my life experience suggests that this is another lie/misconception like honest politicians or charitable enterpreneurs
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
i do not have proof, but i have some interesting evidence of that. let me explain...
<br>
<br>
1. most of you claim to
<b>
 see
</b>
things while APing. like you get out of your body and see your room and yourself lying in the bed. well, guess what, you can only see things if you have eyeballs, retina, nerves, and all those nice things. they are what make us see things they way we see them. how do you know red is red and blue is blue? because your mind registers the difference between electomagnetic waves it receives from red and blue objects and labels them as those colors. in reality there is no color. there are atoms and waves. the only way to see color is with human eyes (or cat's eyes; but for example snake eyes won't do). therefore the most likely explanation to "astral sight" is that it is a creation of you brain. even if AP is real, you certainly would not see the objects the same way (or even close) while in AP, because you don't have your physical eyes with you

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach
</a>
<br>
<br>
2. i made an observation about the kind of people who usually believe AP. now this is going to sound offensive and rude... sorry, but i will say it anyway
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
all you guys have one thing in common: lack of education. most of the time you hear something you do not need proof. as long as enough other people believe it - you will believe it too. some of the articles i read about AP were hilarious! one guy was concentrating on a candle and questioning himself "what is fire made of?". open a damn physics book, the answer is right there!!! lol. there is no real scientific studies about AP, because none of you guys know how to conduct one. sorry. in general, the kind of ignorance about world you demonstrate on these forums is way above average ignorance. once again, this is what i saw on these forums and it is my perception/opinion. don't be mad, please.
<br>
<br>
3. i made another observation about the AP people. this one is kinda ugly too, bear with me please. you all have another thing in common: weak mind. i saw the funniest convo in another topic. it went something like that:
<br>
<br>
guy1: when APing i can see things very clear
<br>
guy2: but can you read a text?
<br>
guy1: yes, i can.
<br>
guy2: wow! be my mentor please and slap me around for you are so much cooler than me.
<br>
<br>
as long as a person can speak fast and say mind blowing things - you will follow them anywhere. think about it, this is not your first "spiritual" hobby, is it? you have been used by the opposite sex in the past quite a bit, haven't you? when some1 tries to start a fight with you you say "i don't want to fight" instead of punching him, don't you? most commonly you suppress your fear, not anger, right? you are weak minded, this is why. sorry...
<br>
<br>
ALMOST THE END...
<br>
<br>
when some1 tells me David Copperfield went through the Chinese wall, I don't start thinking this is magic. there is simply nothing to suggest that it is! if i cannot explain it - it does not become supernatural automatically. i don't know how they can predict hurricanes or launch missions to mars, but they do and there is only science to it. by the way, i know that there is three possibilities about Copperfield: (1) he went above the wall, (2) he went under the wall, (3) he did not go anywhere. i really doubt they would allow him to make a hole in such a historical monument

<section>
(1) People who have been blind from birth cannot see things when they go out of body. Robert Bruce has passed on descriptions of the way people who have been blind from birth actually do interact with the out-of-body environment. People who have had the ability to physically who can no longer physically see will still be able to see while out of body.
<br>
<br>
(2) There is a difference between knowing a thing and experiencing it. Where candle flames are concerned I'd agree that just looking is both better than touching and more satisfying than reading about the molecules and ions involved.
<br>

(3) It would be nice if there was some objective way to measure mental / emotional / spiritual development

"By that definition, we should be blind in our dreams too" - that's what i am talking about. you do not see in your dream. your brain creates your dream. it creates the pictures, you know.
<br>
<br>
when you see something it is actually your brain that receives electromagnetic waves and produces pictures from them. so those "pictures" do not exist in real world, but only in your brain.

<br>
Thank you for your ideas.
<br>
<br>
If you can project into your subconscious mind then you are one step ahead of the rest of humanity
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I am sure you mean "psyche".
<br>
<br>
No projection is in the "real world".  When exiting the body you will either be in the etheric energy level which some people erroneously refer to as the "real-time zone", or you will travel directly to the Astral energy levels.
<br>
<br>
In the case of an OBE the "real time zone" is actually not a time zone at all but rather a lower aspect of the Astral energy levels. It is however so close to the physical plane that it is almost a perfect reflection of it. It is still etheric energy that is being perceived however and accordingly the same laws apply when it comes to reality fluctuations. In other words the environment will be affected by the mind, and in particular your expectations. So if you have a card in mind for any reason, that is the reality you create.
<br>
<br>
Of course people who have a high level of control after projection, particularly over the mind, will indeed be able to accurately select cards in the way you indicate, due to the fact they are able to maintain the stability of the etheric energy, even though it is still a reflection.
<br>
<br>
It is not wise to make judements based on party tricks because it is not the etheric or Astral energy levels that will determine the accuracy, but rather, as with all energy levels above the physical world, it will be the mind of the person doing the observing, or more specifically perceiving.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

 <br>
 We sense through the energy body, feeling seeing hearing ,and send these stimuli back to the physical body to interpret  .We bring to our consciousness that which we perceive and confirm it with the experiences of others .
 <br>
 <br>
 The energy body can be developed to sense more acutely than the physical body . For example physically blind seekers can see with the energy body. Wheelchair-bound or comatose seekers can project to travel .
 <br>
 <br>
 This is a sort of sonar projection of EMR similar to the reception by a bat or a dolphin which can send out a sound wave that  "echos" back to it .This distorted return wave builds up a pattern of energy which the animal can translate to "see " .
 <br>
 <br>
 We send out and receive energy in many ways too that are not limited to the physical eyes .

We are all students and teachers of each we meet on the path .
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So begin today . All humans can meditate to develop clairvoyance  and  to project . Until you do these things yourself you will not believe as you are wrapped in doubt and disfigured by your illusions . Seek the God within yourself. Break free and begin to see.

Excellent. Empirical experience is the way to go. That's what many in this forum also rely on. Dream experience is by nature highly subjective, but there are lots of commonalities.

Not to nitpick, but you do know that these things exist, don't you? They're just not very common. In statistical analysis, they're called "outliers." The comparison is a good one, though. If we were to put dreams under statistical analysis, the really significant experiences known as "astral projection" and OBE would probably be outliers as well. The same goes for spontaneous healing, and miracles of all kinds.

<br>
I tend to agree. It's not reasonable to suggest that one can "see" the physical world exactly the same way when one's eyes are closed. My experience with AP suggests that I see the world how I remember it, mixed with some variation.
<br>
<br>
However, it's important to realize that no one understands how or where memory is stored. There's actually very little to suggest that it is stored in the brain. Definitely, it seems activated, recorded, and experienced through the brain, but not likely stored. The strongest hypothesis I've seen is that it is stored on a cytoplasmic level throughout the body with extensive holographic redundancy. But even that's probably not right. It's a mystery.
<br>
<br>
Dreams are an even bigger mystery, and it's compounded since they seem inextricably related to memory.

Modern education systems discourage free and creative thinking. They are rote, boring, and are a detriment to society. Education wasn't always like this. It used to be practical, based on concrete merit and experience. Apprentices learned in the field, not in a morgue-like classroom.
<br>
<br>
I recommend the author John Taylor Gatto. Here is a brief primer of a handful of his views:

It's completely erroneous to say that none of us know how to conduct scientific experiments regarding AP. There isn't much collaboration because, as you can imagine, it's not something you can just sit down and do on command. It seems tied to the Circadian rhythm (perhaps you've heard of it), and diligent dream journaling often requires losing a lot of sleep.

But, you're right. Lots of people can seem very flakey.

 as long as a person can speak fast and say mind blowing things - you will follow them anywhere. think about it, this is not your first "spiritual" hobby, is it? you have been used by the opposite sex in the past quite a bit, haven't you? when some1 tries to start a fight with you you say "i don't want to fight" instead of punching him, don't you? most commonly you suppress your fear, not anger, right? you are weak minded, this is why. sorry...
</blockquote>
<br>
You kind of lose yourself at the end there. Preventing a fight is a sign of weakness? You need to grow up lol.
<br>
<br>
Suppressing fear is a sign of weakness? That makes no sense. Managing your fear is a sign of courage. Not suppressing anger is weak? Not necessarily, anger can be channeled in highly productive activities. For instance, anger of an injustice can fuel someone to take action.
<br>
<br>
But yeah, you're right, belief in the paranormal tends to attract the weak-minded. That is, if weak-mindedness means forgoing one's own abilities for growth in mature understanding.

 when some1 tells me David Copperfield went through the Chinese wall, I don't start thinking this is magic. there is simply nothing to suggest that it is! if i cannot explain it - it does not become supernatural automatically. i don't know how they can predict hurricanes or launch missions to mars, but they do and there is only science to it. by the way, i know that there is three possibilities about Copperfield: (1) he went above the wall, (2) he went under the wall, (3) he did not go anywhere. i really doubt they would allow him to make a hole in such a historical monument

<br>
Firstly, by what mechanism does the brain distinguish sensory input gained from electromagnetic waves as a colour? Colour is subjective and man made. There are ranges of frequencies which we relate to certain 'ideas' which we call colour. As far as I know, if you have discovered such a mechanism you are the first in the world.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, are you talking about the brain or mind? You use both interchangeably, which implies you perceive a difference between them.
<br>
<br>
As stated above, colour is not seen by the eyes. The eyes are simply devices which sense photonic data. Have you ever read any journals on external perception and internal visual generation? If so you would know that the eyes take in very little information, basic forms, colours and shapes. Reality as you view it is enhanced a lot by your brain.
<br>
<br>
I totally agree that astral sight is a creation of the brain. Sight is a dominant sense in our perception of reality. It only has difference from the other senses because our brains have developed in a way to generate these 'pictures' from this form of input. When we project our brains interpret data in the only way we know how, through the representation of physical viewing (perhaps because it is the dominant sense.) If scientists connected a human brain up to a sonar device, giving them an extra sense, do you think their brain would immediately generate a new form of sensory experience or would it try and fit the data to existing pathways? If you have read into this subject you would have read of blind people who could project, and know that their experience is generated through the sense of touch. Seemingly being able to touch in all directions at the same time.
<br>
Just because things are view along existing neural pathways does not mean AP is false.

<br>
Have you read into any other hobby/area? There would be a range of intelligences there too. What does this point prove? That people who are interested in AP display a standard cross-section of intelligence and academic achievement? If you are basing the premise that most people interested in AP are of a sub-educational standard on a few Internet sites and these forums, then your research is deeply flawed.
<br>
A guy questioning what fire is made of? If he wants to do such a thing let him. Or perhaps we should mock all people who talk in such ways (most poets?)

And they are more groundless assumptions. For a person mocking others academic credentials, and then basing a theory on groundless data is pretty funny.

While there may be some people who have a 'lack of education', not everyone here has. This year in September I should be going to university to study Biology, which I hope I will achieve a masters in. Providing I get ABB at A level of course.  (Exams in less than a week
<img alt=":cry:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cry.png" title="Cry"/>
)
<br>
<br>
I admit I was pretty skeptical until it happened to me, but I did not dismiss other peoples opinions and experiences. Why don't you try it for yourself and then see if you believe it or not? How can you say something is not real without even trying it?
<br>
<br>
When I hear something, I do want proof - this is one of the reasons I am agnostic.  But that doesn't mean I will ignore what someone says if they have no scientific proof, as there are many many things that science have not discovered - new things are being discovered every day. And yes, I will try the card trick when I have become more experienced at OBE's because I myself want proof. You say you don't believe Selski, which is fair enough as you shouldn't always just believe what someone says. But if you are not willing to try it for yourself, then what else can you do?
<br>
<br>
Related to your comment about the eye:
<br>
I've only projected twice I think, but both times I started with a complete lack of vision. Only after a few minutes did I have any sight at all. As you say, our eyes see but it is our brain which interprets it (as far as I know anyway, I don't know too much about the eye it never interested me). I believe this lack of vision at the start is my mind not knowing how to interpret the new information it is getting, and only after a while is it able to change this into vision. Even then my vision is not completely clear, (it often fades again) so it may take many projections before I am able to see clearly (before my mind can interpret the information accurately)

Anton1,
<br>
<br>
My first thought is to ask you to take your own advice. Do the practice, put the card on the table, and keep working at it. I agree with you in part -- the only way to know a thing is real is to demonstrate it unequivocally.
<br>
<br>
Having said that, I can add I absolutely
<u>
 know
</u>
the ability to AP is real. My only instance of AP lasted just a few seconds. I was standing up, looking in a mirror, and feeling a bit disgusted. Suddenly "I" was standing behind myself, looking at me. "I" said, "It's just a biological machine, you know." Then it started to sink in what was going on and I popped back into my body. Didn't need the card. Took awhile to get my chin up off the floor.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
In the above instance, I could see and hear everything just as I normally can. I just didn't happen to be in my body while I was doing so. Go figure.

Hi anton1

There are probably more degrees, second degrees, Masters and PhD's on this site then you could shake a stick at.  So you need to be careful about your sweeping generalizations, about our level of education.
<br>
<br>
But even if that were not the case, Sir William Barrett expressed it best:

<br>
catmeow, this is a fantastic quote. Anton1, some of the things you say and the way you say them sadden me. There is no solidness to your generalisations, the weak mind nonsense is totally useless and incorrect. The opposite is true for many many experienced practitioners of all kinds here.
<br>
Perhaps you hope that predicting flames would prevent them also.
<br>
<br>
There is a reason that most regulars here are still here. They explore, they experiment, they document, and share their data with others who may be interested.
<br>
<br>
Whilst this is not a strictly controlled scientific community, it's something far more important. We are not about preserving some Ivory Tower of some way of thought. Real science is also NOT about preserving one way of thought, but about finding TRUTH, this means attempting in a positive way to prove theories or end up disproving them as necessary, however the emphasis is on the PROOF. Science means I believe "to know" or have I got that wrong (it's late
<img alt=";-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
). To know means not to close your mind to things NOR does it mean blind belief and wishy washiness. It means to honestly try to find out.
<br>
If you care enough to comment, then perhaps you should care enough to seriously leave your silly prejudices behind and actually make your own personal and honest investigation.
<br>
<br>
No-one has to konw you know, if you accidently prove your original narrow viewpoint wrong, you don't have to admit it
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.  Sometimes the last thing we want to do is reveal that a viewpoint held dear has been proven to us personally to be wrong.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The members of the board, appear to me at least appear to be about exploration and developement.  If some of those directions do not appeal to your sensibilities kindly do not engage in them.
<br>
<br>
I do spend time reading skeptic sites such as
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///skepdic.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 skepdic.com
</a>
(not a good example due to it being based on a skeptical philosophy only and not based on scientific rigor) as I believe thorough scientific foundations can only be good for the kinds of practice I am interested in.
<br>
<br>
To what degree are you actually qualified to make your generalisations? How many months have you spent doing your homework? How much do you really know or at least think you know?

That is true but even more strange in studies show that commands like move your finger does not even start in your brain they record that the first signal was transmit for your finger then hit your brain they want back to your finger. that there proves that we don't depend on brain power or conceptions to function but on some other force that is not know by science and probably want be know.but recording to Robert Bruce he suggest that we not in the body in the first place which would explain the origin of the first signal

(5) i feel insulted when you expect me to argue with you. look at your style of "arguing": you make an insane statement, make another one, one more, and then make a super conclusion from all that. where is the proof? you don't need any! proofs are for geeks and... (okay, stop Anton. just stop. dont argue with them, remember?

(6) MisterJingo: "I totally agree that astral sight is a creation of the brain" - GREAT! now watch your opinion change as your friends disagree with this statement trying to show that A-sight is a thing on its own.
<br>
<br>
(7) MisterJingo: "It [sight] only has difference from the other senses because our brains have developed in a way to generate these 'pictures' from this form of input." - huh??? so you are saying this is why sight is different from hearing and taste? hmm. that doesn't make sense, sorry.
<br>
<br>
(8 ) redcatherine: "We sense through the energy body, feeling seeing hearing ,and send these stimuli back to the physical body to interpret". HAHAHA! this must be the best one. you make an outrageous claim, provide no support, and base your subsequent logic partly on that first claim (and partly on nothing). THIS is how most of you guys argue. no logic, only cult-style talking meaningless things to break your opponent on a psychological level. redcatherine you can play psychic with your mindless followers there, im way out of your league.
<br>
<br>
forget the lack of education part. pay attention to my other claim: weak mind. i think the reason you are all here is because it is easier for you to believe in a world with AP and unconditional love than in the world with wars, diseases, and LOTS of unhappy people. i know this is easier. but is it fair to close your eyes on reality? is it fair towards others?

Arrogant as ever eh?
<br>
<br>
So now could you define for me at least exactly what you regard as a weak mind?
<br>
<br>
For me a weak mind has symptoms such as the need to assert superiority by way of attack. Often  superior education is claimed and asserted, in others it's their money or their car. Each to his own form of egotism I guess.
<br>
<br>
Can you honestly prove to us that we all definitly close our minds to the real world? That we ignore suffering and unhappiness?
<br>
<br>
I have sent you a fairly comprehensive reply to your private message. Once again I submit to you the fact that your writing and your manner do not indicate a 24 yr old well educated individual with a rigorous and openly inquiring mind. It would be rude to state my personal opinion as to what I feel your style of writing does indicate.
<br>
<br>
It is insecure to feel that the best way to argue is to attack only. I have more I would wish to say but I am not so well educated and I will need to take some time to decide what more I wish to say and how.
<br>
It is amazing that you devote any time to a subject you so thorougly dislike.
<br>
<br>
I spend zero time on forums criticizing spectator sport or other pursuits I'm not interested in. I do not spend much more time engaged in religious discussion for the same reason. I am surprised that with your "intellect" that you spend any time whatsoever on this subject.

<section>
Nostic might very well be right. Anton1 might be here just to provoke us. If so then we should just ignore him. But in any case here's my comments, because his claims made me smile..
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
1. anton1 claims that we are uneducated when just the opposite is probably true. There has been studies done on people who are interested in spiritual matters. The result was that their IQ was above average. anton1 makes his claim based on few lines from internet.
<br>
<br>
2. anton1 claims that we are weak minded. Here too just the opposite is true. To project you have to have strong mind, otherwise you can't hold the delicate mind state which is required to project. If you have weak mind, you will fall asleep trying. anton1 can try this himself and see if it's easy.
<br>
<br>
3. anton1 claims that the card check test won't work and that if we try it, we will fail and that will burst our little bubble. Well, as many of you know, that is the exact test we are encouraged to take, so we can prove to ourselves projecting is real. Many have done this test and succeeded. It's strange that anton1 came up with this exact same test to taunt us...maybe he has read Bruce's work..
<br>
<br>
anton1 basically thinks we are all weak minded, stupid people who imagine these fantasies because we can't face reality and want to live in a la-la-land. I can see his point if he has never had any "supernatural" events happened to him. It's natural that if you haven't seen something then it's hard to believe in such things, especially when the scientific community doesn't take these things seriously.
<br>
<br>
So, anton1 I say you this: you can believe what you will, it's your right. But you are a man who hasn't seen something and you try to convince a group of people who HAVE seen it. So you see, you have no hope succeeding. All you can hope to accomplish is to provoke some feedback(which you have done very well).
<br>
<br>
You have two choices, you can keep your eyes shut or you can open them and see for yourself. Of course if you like to live in a box where everything is born, then it suffers for awhile and then it dies, then be my guest! But if you have the courage to see if there really is something outside the box..well
<br>
I don't think you will, but I hope that maybe someday you will.
<br>
<br>
Don't believe anything blindly, that's not very smart move, but don't dismiss anything blindly either, that's plain stupid!
<br>

 hi!
 <br>
 <br>
 let's see how you people can handle some truth...
 <br>
 <br>
 according to this website and many others astral traveling is a way to explore REAL world and not your subconscious. is it really? try something next time you travel. take a deck of playing cards, shuffle it, close your eyes and draw a card. put that card on a table (or elsewhere) face up, but don't look at it. and now travel away! once you are tuned to your "astral body" take a look at that card. can you see what it is? when you are back in your physical body compare what you saw in the astral world with what it really is. YOU WILL NOT GUESS THAT CARD!
 <br>
 <br>
 just face it, this "astral traveling" is nothing but a controlled dream. sure it's fun. hey, it's definitely healthier than acid! but astral body is not real and all you see when you travel is the creations of your mind. there is no other dimensions, there is no god. the reality is made of hard work and lies. face it, be strong!
 <br>
 <br>
 wait, my astral body foresees a lot of negativity coming in response to this thread (hehe). let me emphasize some key points here.
 <br>
 <br>
 1) try the experiment. if you guess the card it will be a final proof to yourself and others that astral traveling is real.
 <br>
 <br>
 2) don't weasel out, try the experiment! stop making up excuses!
 <br>
 <br>
 3) seriously, try this experiment. if you can't see the card - you can't see your body from outside and you can't see anything else. it's all made up.
</blockquote>
<br>
Your mind is way out of my league I would say........ Your arguments are lame! You want proof and come up with some card trick to decide whether the astral is real or fantasy. hilarious! what would that prove anyway?

what you describe is not a weak mind. i think we could call it "a person whose ego is bigger than self-esteem".
<br>
<br>
how do you expect me to prove you that you do AP to run away from the real world? this is my judgement. i cannot prove it without hypnotizing you, extracting your subconscious thoughts, and comparing to what you normally are like. i don't do hypnosis.

<br>
<br>
catmeow, you are saying that the card trick described by me (or equivalent) has been done. my response to this is the following... if such a trick was indeed done (and there was no doubt about any1 cheating) that would prove that AP allows people to travel physical space, while physically staying on the same spot. nobody then would send a probe to Titan, because it cost an insane amount of money! they could send APing researchers instead. also, people could use AP to communicate messages at great distances. in military AP abilities could be used for recon, in business AP could be used to find out about competitors' secrets. somehow, with all these obvious benefits, AP is not that wide spread. this is my main evidence that AP is not objectively real. that means the card trick has not been done, or the way it was done does not prove anything.
<br>
<br>
filipcza, you had a long message, i probably won't respond to all points. (the numbers below don't correspond to yours)
<br>
<br>
(1) yeah, the government paid me to come here and mess with you guys.
<br>
<br>
(2) "The result was that their IQ was above average." - a good example of so widely accepted these days false-arguing. first of all, you do not tell us WHO conducted those studies and why should anyone believe those people. secondly, if someone's IQ is above average - what exactly does it mean? what was it? what is the average IQ? how smart does that make them? does believing in God make you spiritual or we are talking about AP type of spiritual? this is why i don't argue with you guys. you are unable to provide a valid argument. trying to shock the opponent with outrageous claims and support with true-sounding lies is the most many of you can do.
<br>
<br>
(3) who has done the card trick? raise your hand please.
<br>
<br>
(4) no, i have never had any supernatural events happen to me. by definition, such events do not exist. prove me otherwise. oh, you don't want to prove? well, excuse me then...
<br>
<br>
(5) "You have two choices" - no, i have more choices. what is it, an attempt to send me down one of two paths both of which lead where you want me to go? play these tricks with your girlfriends please, i am kind of beyond this.
<br>
<br>
you need to wake up, guys. otherwise you will spend all your life doing AP while others will spend theirs making lots of money, travelling, having fun, having great sex. don't you want these things?

The card trick wouldn't actually prove that people could travel in a "spirit body".  It would simply prove that ESP exists, and that we could perceive physical things remotely.  I have done the card trick.  As a teenager I taught myself hypnosis and would hypnotize various people.  One of my subjects was a deep-trance subject and she was very psychic when hypnotized.  I used to set up scenes in other rooms in my parents' house and get her to "travel in her mind" to the room and describe what she saw.  There was no prompting.  Her descriptions were always completely accurate.   There were other experiments I conducted with this subject which were really 100% successful.  There was no possibility of cheating, because the subject was not an illusionist, she did not devise the experiments, was not pre-warned and had no conscious recollection of any of it.  The results went way beyond anything you could expect by chance.  There was simply no way it was coincidence.  I don't expect you to believe this because you are not mentally equiped to cope with the implications.  It
<i>
 doesn't fit into your world view
</i>
so it can't be true.
<br>
<br>
I have also seen a couple of psychics and their readings were so mind-numbingly unconvincing, that if I based my views about ESP solely on readings given to me by paid psychics I wouldn't be a believer.
<br>
<br>
But I have seen it working first-hand, so as far as I am concerned ESP is a given. We need to look into it and figure out how and why it works.
<br>
<br>
Many of the great thinkers of the past century, Einstein, Feynman etc, were deeply spiritual and believed in a purpose behind creation.  Einstein believed that the laws of the universe must necessarily be mathematically beautiful, because he believed God would wish it this way.  Were these "weak" minds, because they believed in God, and a purpose behind creation?  I think not.
<br>
<br>
You are wrong to assume that there is nothing to AP.  There is.  I don't know what it is, but there is something to it.

Ok how old are you?  Really, i want to know.  Don't give me that you're around 22 or 23 or older.  You display a completely sophomoric behavior i would expect out of an arrogant teenage jock.  Now you said earlier that we're the kind of people that say "i don't want to fight" when prompted to?  I can tell you, that is not the case.  I usually don't let them get passed Do you.  Either I'll break a kneecap (which is not difficult at all) or a collar bone (even simpler, only 7 lbs of force required.)  Oh look, he knows how to look on the Internet on how to break peoples bones.  No, I'm an active martial artists and have got my first degree about a year ago.  I train with my friend who is as good or better than I.  Just to say the least, we were threaded with our lives by 4 men.  We left with maybe a sore side, but we also left with 4 hurting individuals to pave our way out.  That's besides the point.
<br>
<br>
Ok heres a summary of your pathetic and weak argument.
<br>
<br>
You - Ok guys heres the plan.  Try this science project out and see that you're wrong.
<br>
<br>
Us - Ok, you try a science project out and see if were right.
<br>
<br>
you - NO!!
<br>
<br>
you see where this is heading?  You are just having a good time by yourself.  You're not even trying to make a solid point.  You just want to be the kid who went up to the pokemon table and told them only kids play pokemon.  Now (to use your pathetic phrasing) this may be harsh but... you're a complete moron and probably were never hugged by your parents.   You have told us you were done here on several occasions but continue to post.  WHY?  Because you have been cleverly contradicted in some way and you find it necessary to come back and insist that you're right.
<br>
<br>
Where are you going with this.  Even if we are wrong, there are maybe 100-200 people who will tell you otherwise.  The majority is always right buddy.  Who cares if you've got point.  Go share it elsewhere.  Here you will not make an impression.  All you will get is contradiction.  And more contradiction.  If you're goal is to change our minds you are sadly mistaken.
<br>
<br>
Another example of your pathetic arguments summarized
<br>
<br>
You - you are all uneducated
<br>
<br>
Us - well i have a 2 degrees, am a graduate, and have a masters
<br>
<br>
You - hahah your lying...
<br>
<br>
What makes us so sure that YOU are educated?  Huh?
<br>
<br>
What do you want us to do for you?  Scan our degrees and post them for your viewing pleasure.  Maybe you'll want pennies along with them to make sure their just not of google.  I've already said enough.  You're just not going to win this one.  You might as well put a shield and helmet on and call out the roman army while you're at it.  Just go somewhere else.

<br>
<br>
Ok i hope you see where this is going.  A lot of us here do this when we have time.  When we come home from "making money" we decide to do something besides watch TV all day.  We try a bit of Astral Projection out.  Cus you're damn right, it beats the hell out of acid.  I would know.  So if you like to have fun by watching the teletubbies, and we like to have fun by APing, ..... whats the problem here?  You have your fun and we'll have ours.
<br>
<br>
Also, you said something about challenging us to prove astral projection is real.  Unfortunately the only way to do that at all would be to give you 3 things.

An open mind
<br>
Some preliminary basics.
<br>
And your willing and unbiased attempt.
<br>

I know if you ever try this, (you won't), your mind set will be "this is so stupid i can't believe I'm doing this."  Hence, no results.  Get an open mind, stop looking at life through a straw, and quit bashing strangers you'll never meet or personal know over the Internet.

<br>
If you know what is real and what is not, please tell me. Tell me what life is. Tell me what time is. Tell me what energy and consciousness are, why they exist and where they come from. Tell me what dimensions are, and how you know what they are.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what life is. I don't know what time is, or energy or consciousness. So how do I know many how dimensions there are, or what dimensions are? Why does 2 plus 2 equal four?
<br>
<br>
As humans we have awareness, perception and thought. What else?
<br>
<br>
There is one thing I'm sure of: I'm not sure I know anything. I certainly do not know what is real.
<br>
<br>
Here are some quotes from Einstein:
<br>
<br>
"Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods."
<br>
"In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep."
<br>
"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe."
<br>
"Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I began to experience lucid dreams and OBE spontaneously and later had some success in initiating them.
<br>
<br>
During one experience, in which I seemed to be in the out of body state, moving around the room, a funny thing happened: the phone rang.
<br>
<br>
My object in this experience was to be as aware as possible of all details of my perceptions in order to later compare the perceived environment to the "real" environment.  So, when in the out of body state, floating near the ceiling of the room, I heard the phone ring, I wondered whether the phone was "really" ringing. I then heard the answering machine take the call, and the caller leave a message. I realized I could check this later.
<br>
<br>
Back in the normal waking state of consciousness, I checked the machine. The message was on the tape as I had heard it from the out of body state.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>

LOL, that's funny. Just yesterday I was reading a bunch of quotes from Einstein. It's beautiful that such a great intellect could see that greater things lay
<i>
 beyond
</i>
the intellect.
<br>
<br>
Here are 2 of my favorite quotes:
<br>
<br>
"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift."
<br>
<br>
"I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."

Yeh Einstein was quite a guy.
<br>
<br>
I just couldn't resist adding the following quote, which I spotted in the Quantum Metaphysics forum:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it"
</i>
- Max Planck
<br>
<br>
Intellectual midgets like anton1 will eventually be replaced by better minds.

 (6) MisterJingo: "I totally agree that astral sight is a creation of the brain" - GREAT! now watch your opinion change as your friends disagree with this statement trying to show that A-sight is a thing on its own.
 <br>
 <br>
 (7) MisterJingo: "It [sight] only has difference from the other senses because our brains have developed in a way to generate these 'pictures' from this form of input." - huh??? so you are saying this is why sight is different from hearing and taste? hmm. that doesn't make sense, sorry.

<br>
I guess you have never heard of the medical condition synesthesia then. Do a google on it. With this condition people actually physically feel taste, smell sound, see sound etc. It's a documented condition.
<br>
One could assume that this is a relatively rare medical condition where the brain is wired differently in sufferers, but one needs only look at documentation of psychedelic experience where 'psychedelic' doses of a compound create synesthesia effects too. People seeing music, feeling music, tasting it, or smelling sound etc. So it seems we can all bypass this brain catagorisation mechanism which distinguishes sensory inputs from each other. I've even experienced similar during trance-states and meditation.

Hi MisterJingo
<br>
<br>
Yeh I thought exactly the same thing as you and I also considered posting about synesthesia.  The guy's arguments simply don't hold up.  The physical sense organs, brain and mind are all different things, but anton1 seems to confuse all of these.
<br>
<br>
So I can clarify it for him:
<br>
<br>
Our subconscious mind creates a representation of the external world and presents it to our conscious mind as a set of images, sounds, tastes, odours and touch sensations.  But the sense organs which gather this information can be switched (synesthesia) or they need not be physical organs at all (clairvoyance).
