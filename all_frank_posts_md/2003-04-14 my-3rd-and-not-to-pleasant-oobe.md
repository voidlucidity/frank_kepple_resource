<section>
My 1st OOBE, about 1 mo. ago, was merely the sensation of levitation with intense vibration and physical paralyis.  I didn't know what was happening, so I freaked and made it stop.
<br>
<br>
My 2nd experience was much more pleasant and I felt my second body pulled out in a stretching sensation feet first and found myself with my face against the ceiling.  I set a destination and shot out of the room and felt like I as traveling; I chickened thinking I might get lost and set my target back to my bedroom ceiling and decided to roll and look down at myself.  When I tried to open my eyes, I popped back into body.
<br>
<br>
My 3rd experience this a.m. was not as nice.  I felt like I came in contact with a negative entity that was holding me down, tugging and pulling on my breasts and attempting to have sex with me.  I was surrounded by a cacophony of echoing voices like many conversations in a large gathering where you can't quite make out what anyone is saying.  But, I could hear someone repeatedly calling my name.
<br>
<br>
This is very embarassing for me to relate this on a public forum, but my need to know what happened is stronger than my embarassment; so I would appreciate some serious help here.

Another OOBE!   Wow, I guess when they start there is no turning back!  I went back to bed early this a.m. after my husband left for work.  I was using a guided meditation tape to start my day as I do every day and was extremely relaxed and cautious due to my previous experience.  Having been enrolled in psychic development classes, I decided to say my prayer of protection and visualized my target destination via a direct line tunnel, which was to my husband's workshop.  I experienced the vibratory phase only briefly when I sensed the sexual intent of the entity nearby and anticipated a repeat of my last OOBE, so I visualized a rocket take off, arched my neck back slightly and shot out of body like a bullet.  I was traveling at a great rate of speed for what seemed like too long just to get to my husband's shop, so I turned around to venture a look back to see how far I'd come and I popped back in!  I really have to work on my self-control!
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking my previous experience may have been that I was caught in the lower astral, as once I shot out of my body this time, I sensed I was alone and there wasn't the noise and raucous of the voices or the sexual predator, which btw, I didn't sense as being of human origin, it seemed more animal-like.

The "sexual predator" as you call it is probably just some aspect of yourself you are meeting with head-on as a result of entering the Astral environment.
<br>
<br>
One of the realities we have to face within such an environment, is we all have aspects of ourself we perhaps never realised existed. These aspects can, "come to life" and cause all manner of difficulties. Some aspects are immediately beneficial in the short-term; yet some are not so beneficial in the short-term, but having to deal with these aspects can often turn-out to have longer-term beneficial effects.

Frank thanks for your input...I have learned to {{never}} say never, and you've certainly given me food for thought, but geez, can't quite seem to picture an aspect of myself as a sexual predator.  Can you direct me to any web sources to expound on this line of thinking?
<br>
<br>
I'm open, but intuitively I feel like it was something outside of myself.

PJ: Believe me, you will do yourself a big favour and accelerate your development greatly, if you realise right from the start that within the Astral environment everything can be entirely under your control.
<br>
<br>
When I first started there were no desktop computers and no Internet. Consequently, it took me just over 5 years of trial and error before I finally realised the basic rule that Thought=Direct Action. During this time I fought every kind of monster, encountered every kind of demon, and slayed countless dragons.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 Within the Astral, because of the inherent nature of the environment, everything "within" ourselves tends to manifest "outside" of ourselves.
</u>
<br>
<br>
Which is why it is such a great place to learn: phobias, character flaws, fears, and such like, can instantly manifest all around you (and often in glorious 3D-Technicolour). Plus, other challenging circumstances can come about not just from yourself, but you discover all kinds of legacies from past lives too.
<br>
<br>
If that were not difficult enough, consider that when we project we don't suddenly develop some super-sense of conscious awareness all primed and geared for Astral use. On the contrary, the sense of conscious awareness you take with you to the Astral is the very same one you have now. All of which means you tend to behave like a fish out of water at first.
<br>
<br>
To help overcome these hurdles, you need to gain a fair degree of understanding about the basic nature of the Astral environment, and the different ground-rules that apply. We have to gain familiarity with these basic rules in much the same way as we do when first entering the Physical. For example, perhaps the one most basic Physical rule (we gain familiarity with rather quickly!) is that no two physical things can occupy the same physical space.
<br>
<br>
A person who could not get the hang of this basic rule would forever have difficulties. Not only would they keep bumping into things, pursuits such as driving a car, for instance, would be nigh on impossible. Same thing applies with Astral exploration where, without an understanding of the basic ground rules, people will keep running into difficulties.
<br>
<br>
The basic rules are:
<br>
<br>
1) Thought equals Direct Action.
<br>
2) Your experiences are primarily governed by your expectations.
<br>
3) Like instantly attracts like.
<br>
4) Your ability to perceive is proportional to your willingness to believe.
<br>
<br>
All the above are important to always bear in mind especially when analysing your experiences afterwards. Perhaps the one most important, however, is rule 1.
<br>
<br>
Releasing uncontrolled thoughts-release-emotions within the Astral environment acts as a kind of fuel that goes to creating the circumstances that surround you. So if you release a little fear (very common) you will instantly find yourself in a mildly fearful circumstance.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Problem is, finding yourself all of a sudden in a scary situation will normally have the effect of making you even more fearful. So the situation will instantly become that much more scary; which makes you more scared; so it gets that much more scary; which makes you even more scared; and so on, and so on.......
</i>
<br>
<br>
This is a *tricky* one to overcome because these circumstances can seem
<u>
 just
</u>
as real, and
<u>
 equally
</u>
as lifelike, as circumstances are within the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Also, in the early stages you can often feel what first seem like pretty weird bodily sensations. After a while they simply become normal to the extent where they are ignored. Myself I get all manner of sensations in the chest area and I expect so too do others. This is because there is a major energy centre in that region.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 In my early days of exploration, I'd so often become immersed in circumstances which had gotten completely out of hand from coming to a snap-judgement as to their nature or origin.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Because of this, I now advise people the most productive state of mind is to remain emotionally closed and maintain an air of natural curiosity. The moment a person feels they have slipped from this mental composure, I would advise them to
<u>
 immediately
</u>
take a step back from the situation and ask for more clarity. If that doesn't work then retreat back to Physical and analyse the situation from there.
<br>
<br>
Again, because of the inherent nature of the Astral environment, everything "within" ourselves tends to manifest "outside" of ourselves. If you always bear that in mind and please try to always analyse your experiences against the background of the 4 rules given above, you will make quicker progress I'm sure.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank:  Your generous lesson is much appreciated and gives me much insight into what may or may not have occurred as I look back at it now.  This particular sensation was new to me, however, the intense sensations in the chest area aren't new to me, now that I think back.  During an attempt at remote viewing a few months ago, I felt like the center of my back near my heart was attached to a strong  electrical source which crawled up over my shoulders and down the front of my arms and into my hands.  With each site description I uttered, another wave of electricity traveled down my arms.  It was startling to say the least.
<br>
<br>
I can barely express my joy at having the opportunity to discuss my experiences with people who won't be laughing behind my back; because believe me, if I didn't know me better, I'd be laughing behind my back, too!  I am such a serious, down-to-earth person; this is still  a bit too out there for me.
<br>
<br>
You post was so meaningful to me that I'm printing it out so that I can re-read it prior to future OOBE attempts, just to keep the ground rules fresh in my mind.
<br>
<br>
It's odd that I really don't have any consciously specific expectations as to what I will experience.  I feel very much the fish out of water, except that my synopsis would read:  She just jumped off a 10,000 foot high cliff with hopes that she will grow wings before she hits the earth.  I really felt pretty calm, in an semi-alarmed sort of way[^]  I was consciously aware I was OOB and though I didn't sense at the time that I was controlling the scene, I did believe I could leave it at any time, and felt somewhat like an observer, waiting to see what would happen next.
<br>
<br>
I gleen from your post that you would recommend I
<i>
 should
</i>
have specific intentions in order to direct my voyages to places/sites/experiences that would interest me, rather than let whatever happen as it may.
<br>
<br>
My first Thought = Direct Action would be to see something, as so far everything has been blackness and when I attempt to open my eyes I'm instantly back to physical.  Can you help me tackle this?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again, Frank

I was going to post something related to our subconcious but Frank has post about that comprehansively and I could  never said it any better. My experience is my emotion are always multiplied tenfold in the astral. If there is sexual tension in me on the physical then I have a huge problem controlling my desire on the astral. Also I've read about Frank's post regarding training zone. I don't know if I have been playing in the training zone lately?
<br>
<br>
You can check this out
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://members.tripod.com/~Xperiment/gracia.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

<br>
It explain something regarding subconcious fear. For example, after he project for a few months and reading his journal he discovered a recurring pattern. Often, he would try to fly but he would be blocked by tree branches. It is sometime before he come realise this symbolism but once he become aware of this and work on his 'problem' this do not occur anymore.
<br>
<br>
Frank has point out about the basic rule and other thing countless time and we're very fortunate that he never tire of explaining the same thing all over again to us (my Astral conciousness thread on prence on the onset of projection a while back and countless time on other thread). [

<section>
After reading your posts I would like to comment that your encounter could be a result of your own subconscious. However, I feel compelled to point out that Many people have reported encounters with negative entities and many of those cannot be explained away as being the result of the subconscious mind.
<br>
In any event, whatever was the cause of your encounter the important fact to remember is to project confidence and courage while projecting. Thoughts are nearly as important as actions in both the astral and ethereal (etheric) planes. (It appears that your encounter took place in the ethereal.) Many negative entities (eg, Spirit Hinderers and elementals) feed off the confusion and fear that they try to create. Denying those entities fear and confusion always weakens thems and empowers you.
<br>
BTW your tactic of evading the discarnate by travelling away at high speed apparently was quite successful. Good Luck. [8D]

I'm not familiar with the planes of existence, as I see I should be.  Astral Travel was touched on extremely lightly in my last class and after reading my workbook, I see that I could have visualized moving up one plane or more if I encountered undesirable aspects.  I suppose at this point, the only way I'll know for sure is experience.   By targeting a higher plane, I presume I would leave the negatives behind, and take my own issues along with me possibly to meet up with later; separating the wheat from the chaff, so to speak?
<br>
<br>
I certainly appreciate everyone's insightful comments and no-nonsense welcome.

<section>
PJ: Congratulations on your first few Astral experiences!
<br>
<br>
I have also had OBEs remarkably similar to the one you describe; not a lot of fun. I usually project by "waking up" in paralysis after a dream (often a nightmare - not a good place to start!), and project  from there. If I am not on-the-ball, I forget to project and revert to my former "panic and try to move" thing, and sometimes at this point I will think my husband is trying to wake me, but it turns out to be some kind of sexual predator.
<br>
<br>
I don't doubt that this is a result of my fear. The question is whether the situation is generated by my imagination and subconscious (like a prop), or whether I am attracted to ACTUAL entities and places because of my issues, whatever they may be.
<br>
<br>
Either way, the same internal issues need to be dealt with. Some ideas: I think of the predator as being the part of your psyche that wants to destroy you. What part of you is being preyed apon? What part of you is the predator? -  Even if the predator is a real astral entity, it is still fulfilling some kind of "need" in you, or you wouldn't be attracting it - Why is it choosing the symbol of your sexuality? What part of you does your sexuality represent?
<br>
<br>
Hope this is useful; It's been useful for ME to think about these things!
<br>
<br>

That's the general problem people have once they begin to make some kind of progress. Being successful at this entails getting used to experiencing (what at first feel like) some pretty
<u>
 weird
</u>
bodily sensations.
<br>
<br>
Just as you get used to the sensations presented by one set of circumstances, along come yet more to be dealt with. I always say that it is one thing
<i>
 talking
</i>
about entering the Astral from flying through some entrance structure (of the like printed on the back cover of Astral Dynamics, for example) and yet another thing actually
<i>
 doing
</i>
it!
<br>
<br>
Over the years I've developed a gung-ho attitude towards Astral exploration. As such, my enthusiasm for new ventures is at the stage where it knows no bounds. But I do, however, still remember just how shocking these sensations can be at first. And I still now and again come across new circumstances which
<u>
 severely
</u>
test my resolve.
<br>
<br>
It's like anything where you keep pushing the boundaries. Only within the Astral there are no boundaries. Only the ones we place upon ourselves (which susequently become manifest due to the nature of the environment: Rule 2).

Light and dark can have entirely different meanings within the Astral. Darkness, on the Physical, normally means lack of light. Whether that be daylight or artificial light. However, darkness, within the Astral, can very often signify lack of understanding (which is generally linked to the formation of doubts).
<br>
<br>
Often you can still perceive the Astral circumstances around you, but they become similar to shadows on the Physical. This still happens to me I'd say at least once every 3 or 4 projections. At first it was very confusing. I found, however, that if I think of taking a few deep breaths (not that there is any need to breathe on the Astral, but that's the way I think of it) my awareness, more often than not, will become clear again. In other words, it's like someone just switched the lights back on.
<br>
<br>
As I breathe in, I imagine myself taking on-board all the necessary understanding: to the extent where I can become open to the experience which is being presented. As I breath out, I imagine releasing any niggling fears, doubts or whatever other confusion, which is causing my awareness to be dulled.
<br>
<br>
This darkness is *very* common when being introduced to new circumstances. Remember, your ability to perceive is directly proportional to your willingness to believe.
<br>
<br>
It is very natural for people to experience doubts *particularly* when either coming across, or being introduced to new circumstances. Doubt obviously affects your willingness to believe which, in turn, affects your ability to perceive. The way in which your ability to perceive can be commonly affected is that the circumstance can appear to go out of focus, or, as explained above, it's like someone turned down the lights.
<br>
<br>
So whenever you come across "darkness" if you can, try getting to the habit of becoming more open to the circumstance. You can do this by taking a step back, taking a few deep breaths while asking for more clarity, or for more understanding (or for more of whatever it is you feel you need). Then approach the circumstance again.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes you find you have to persevere quite a bit before the circumstance reveals itself, and other times it may all come clear the first attempt or two. Though don't be surprised if you now and again come across circumstances which only come clear over a number months, or even years.
<br>

I'm *really* bowled over by your comments. Problem is though I'm simply not good enough - writing wise - to write the kind of book which would be commercially viable. Besides, what I
<u>
 most

enjoy is giving beginners a helping-hand, on an on-going basis, which I can do here.
<br>
<br>
I have noticed, however, over the past few months, I tend to be answering similar kinds of questions a number of times. What I have done is try and catalogue these common answers and store them as text files so I can cut-and-paste where necessary.

Okay, I know that may sound a bit non-personal but it *is* a fact that beginners do keep experiencing very similar problems. While I am happy to spend time where necessary, time spent typing the same sets of words over and over, where it is not necessary to do so, seems a bit of a waste. Which I am sure people will understand.
<br>
<br>
Again, I am truly bowled-over by all your respective comments and wish each and every one of you all the *very* best in your inner exploration.
<br>

Yours,
