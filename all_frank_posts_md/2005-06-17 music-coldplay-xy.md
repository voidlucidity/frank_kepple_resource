Hello to all you Music Lovers
<br>
<br>
Anyone heard/got the new album by Coldplay?
<br>
<br>
I got it yesterday, and have heard it about 14 times already.  I think it's great.
<br>
<br>
When I was younger, I prided myself on NOT liking mainstream bands.  I adored Pulp before they made it, and as soon as Common People came out from Glastonbury, I went off them!!
<br>
<br>
Now I'm older, those mainstream, middle of the road bands seem more appealing...
<br>
<br>
I'll be into Dire Straits next...

<br>
Actually, I do like ONE of their tracks - The Telegraph Road.
<br>
<br>
But I do still have obscure taste.  Anyone heard of The Tiger Lillies?

I like them, but they do seem to be a little depressive IMO.  I did hear a techno remix of God put a smile.. that was sooo awesome, but it doesn't seem to be the one on the file sharing systems.  (oh, and you can't buy it in stores either)
<br>
<br>
I liked the Killers before the radio stations overplayed them.  Anyone ever heard of Interpol?  Still kinda downers but cool none the less.

I just logged on to my AOL dial-up account and fighting through the adverts (as you do on AOL) I happened to come across an ad for their new album at 4.99 euro. Ha ha, I thought. What a coincidence and then I realised there must be thousands of such ads and not such a coincidence at all.
<br>
<br>
Telegraph Road is one of my all-time favourite tracks.
<br>
<br>
Tiger Lillies, of course, you are trying to seduce me with your London esoteric rock-band knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Yes, I love Interpol, but only have Antics.  Quirky stuff.

<section>
the music i like is too controversial to be mainstream, and much music NEVER playes them.
<br>
<br>
the only linkin park video i ever saw on much was breaking the habit.
<br>
Godsmack is too "Hardcore"
<br>
Strung out is anti government
<br>
Queensryche's best album is about a hitman who goes insane
<br>
rammstein is too hardcore
<br>
cold hasn't gone big enough to be on much.
<br>
<br>
Personaly i consider it a compliment for much to NOT play my music

i cant stand how everyone loves coldplay, to me there boring, plain, unadventurus etc... radiohead are 10 times the band they are, i heard its number 1 in 27 countries or so??
<br>
its really not a good thing that coldplay seem to represent british music to the rest of the world, ive seen local live gigs more interesting than coldplay.

Not everyone loves Coldplay, but I know what you mean.  I too have seen much better bands that never made it, playing their hearts out, really putting their all into it, in dingy little clubs to 40 people.  It's a difficult market to break into though - you need a lot of luck.  It's not necessarily about talent either - although bands that keep going (and Coldplay have now had three hugely successful albums), must at least have some appeal, otherwise the public will eventually stop buying them.  However, we are also very easily seduced by marketing.
<br>
<br>
There will always be one or two bands that are the top of the pyramid, so to speak, and representative of that country's music - it's just the way it is.  Of course, bands get knocked off the top spot as soon as the next "best band in the world" come along.
<br>
<br>
I've tried and tried and tried with Radiohead, and whilst I like a couple of tracks, I simply just don't "get" what it's all about.  It doesn't work for me.  Believe me, I've really given them a good innings.

I've only just seen this - that's highly amusing.  The Tiger Lillies - a

band?  They are about as far away from rock as Nine Inch Nails are from soul

It's nice to start the day with a smile - especially a Monday.
