Hello my fellow Pulsars,
<br>
<br>
Just like to say that this site is great.
<br>
I've been looking through some of the stuff on this forum and I can tell you, it's right up my street.
<br>
<br>
I dwell in England, I got interested in this kind of stuff in the early nineties; life didn't make much sense before then. I don't like using the word spirituality; I don't want to label myself. I like to think of my self as me exploring all things that draw my attention. I have this feeling that all road lead to Home... sorry should that be Rome?
<br>
<br>
It's so uplifting to know that not every forum out there on the web is talking about playing ladies and gentlemen.
<br>
<br>
Look forward to chatting in the future.
