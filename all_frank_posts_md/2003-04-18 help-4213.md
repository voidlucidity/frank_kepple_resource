The author Bruce Moen says it is possible to speak with people who have died without first having to learn astral projection. The welcome page to his web site is
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/
</a>
and it leads to a main page at
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/start.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/start.html
</a>
where you can find what you are looking for (I think).

Yep, I echo that. For most people, Astral projection is a tricky thing to get to grips with. If all you are seeking to do is make contact with someone who has passed over, Bruce Moen claims to have had all manner of successes with people having made contact with former loved ones after just a little tuition. They also have a message-board where you can speak with people who have already read Mr Moen's books and attended his workshops.
