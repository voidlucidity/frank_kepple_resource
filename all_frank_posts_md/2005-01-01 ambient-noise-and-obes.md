<b>
 Happy New Year everybody!
</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a question for you:
<br>
<br>
When I meditate I need to be in a place that is either very quiet or where there is a monotonous noise bed, such as the hum of an air fan or something of that nature. Every little noise outside of this spectrum will disturb me and ultimately the meditation or OBE.
<br>
<br>
I am wondering if there is anything I can do to become less prone to being disturbed by noise and whether there are any techniques which have worked for you.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I went to our local supermarket and bought a noise protection headset, like the ones used by shooters, hunters or machine operators. I wore it for meditation and so far the results have been great. I had an excellent and fast meditation onset and even a short OBE.
<br>
<br>
Is there anything else (better) that I can do?
<br>
<br>
Best wishes for the new year and thank you for your responses!
<br>
<br>
Michael

I am the same unfortunately. Sometimes I wish there was a way of shutting my ears down in the same way as we can simply close our eyes. Background sounds, especially if they are familiar to me, don't bother me all that much. Monotonous sounds, such as a fan, can often help. But the moment an unfamiliar sound comes up then it breaks the state for me completely. I live in a very quiet area but in the summer the wildlife can make a heck of a din. So then I often wear earplugs which help enormously.
<br>

Yours,

I've been meaning to mention this for some time.
<br>
<br>
I've twice had an "MRI" scan performed on my right knee.  What actually happens during an MRI scan is that you go into a large room containing a huge MRI machine and lay on a bed which then slides into the machine.  The operator gives you some headphones, does a runner to get out of the room, and then turns on the machine.  There has to be nobody else in the room because I think it interferes with the magnetic fields used (or else it's dangerous).
<br>
<br>
The scan takes about 15 minutes and during this time, you hear all sorts of hissing noises, bangs, thumps and hummings. It's not noisy, in fact the whole thing is so
<i>
 soporific
</i>
that on both occasions I found myself being, more-or-less "forced" into the mind-awake-body-asleep state.  So much so that I could actually tell when my physical sense of hearing shut down, because all of the hissing and humming noises suddenly stopped.  It was quite fascinating.
<br>
<br>
If only somebody would record the noise of an MRI machine in operation, and make it available, in high quality stereo format, I think it would be a very useful aid to meditation etc!
