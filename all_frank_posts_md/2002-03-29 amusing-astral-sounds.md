I thought I would start a post about funny astral noises that people could add to.
<br>
<br>
I find some of the noises very amusing.  Once I heard what sounded like a gazoo.  It made a whoo..whoo...whooooo only as a gazoo can do but right by my ear in the middle of the night and trust me know one had a gazoo in the room.  I have what I now call my pet dog noise.  I hear a growling of a dog frequently but since I love dogs (large dogs) it seems rather a poor thing to use to try to deter me from projecting. I think I would be more afraid of one of those nasty little barky dogs. I would be interested in any amusing stories others might have.  My experiences with these noises is that they are very short lived and only occur when I am in the transition between sleep and waking.

All the Best,

Hi violet,
<br>
<br>
I have experienced noises also, i have heard people ranting, knocking. I could hear a woman ranting, told her to shut, lol, it worked.
<br>
Once i thought i heard my daughter (14 year old) crying, this was in transit state, brought me back to my body and found that my daughter was fast alsleep.
<br>
I am learning to ignore them.  I also get ear ringing when out of body, sometimes quite intense.
<br>
Any ideas on the ear ringing?

The sounds you hear are within you. Only your interpretation of them is different. No human-being has ever heard a sound that did not eminate within them. It's only the auditory-illusion process, on the physical level... that tricks you into thinking sounds, per se, eminate from without.

This is an interesting topic Violet. Just want to share a sound my daughter had once whilst OOB.Altho it was years ago, she was totally uplifted by it and thought it must "mean" something and she's never forgotten it. But it hasn't eventuated into meaning anything. It was the sound of what seemed like a beautiful heavenly chorus of "angels" singing "Twelve". Just the number Twelve. She said it was totally inspirational.Any ideas what it could be or mean?

I have heard the angel chorus myself once.  I don't remember any specific word being sung, just the sound of the voices singing.  This singing seemed to me to be coming from a specific direction, not just inside my head.  I've also heard mumbling voices and what seemed like a radio.   One sound that always freaks me out a little is the sound of footsteps in the hall outside my bedroom.

Hey,
<br>
<br>
Astral sounds hmm....does the screaming and wailing of those caught in dead time...count?  As for sounds being created from *within* you...umm, I am prone to strongly disagree based on my own experience and interpretation of the astral and other realms.  Although, I am interested in what your getting at, could you possibly make it clearer so I do not misconstrue your ...point/idea?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

I am new to this forum, and I think it could be my new addiction!  I'm new to the world of oobe, sort of.  I too hear noises, including the radio!  My shrink once asked me if I heard voices, and I said yes.  When she asked me what they said, I told her they generally were giving me the weather report.  I also have heard my name called out very loudly by a male voice.  I can't believe other people hear the radio!  Cool!

I can uderstand a certain amount of sounds heard while in one of many pre-o.b states being a result of your own mind but find the name thing to be a bit strange.Regardless to wether im just drifting off,being approached by an astral entitiy or in a full blown energy shift of many sorts im fast to realize I never recognise the voices which call out to

mentioned above while prior to an o.b.e I have had beings in the room close by or at a distance call out my name as if they are trying to coax me o.b. Why is this???

To me it seems more like the voices and sounds are a barrier that you have to overcome rather than something trying to coax you into an oobe.  Overcoming fear seems to me to play a large part in success and growth.
<br>
<br>
As far as the radio thing goes, I used to actually think it was a radio.  I would think to myself, "Why do people always turn up the radio nextdoor when I am trying to have an OBE?"  I eventually realized that there was no radio on anywhere nearby.

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
As I understand it - when you OBE you carry with you a full set of senses, equivalent to your physical senses, but greatly enhanced. In the physical body, your Astral senses stil exist, but the organic brain is effectively a filter of the senses received from the sense organs, and that filtering process "dulls" them. That is why garlic is still effective against negs for example, and greater than 360 degree vision exists as an OBE.
<br>
<br>
Logic would dictate however that as Astral entities are non-organic, all sounds and communication are carried out telepathically and empathically and are accordingly *not* sounds as we know them in the physical world. However, while in the real-time zone, one would expect, I suppose, to hear physical noise as a reflection of that actual noise.
<br>
<br>
Interesting issue - and that is merely my understanding of how things work based upon my research of these issues.
<br>
<br>
With best regards, and good night (it's 01:13 here)
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I used to listen to what I considered "The Music of the Spheres" fairly frequently. It sounded like intensely beautiful symphonic music drifting through space.
<br>
<br>
The sounds I remember even more are the slamming doors, breaking glass, gunshots, voice yelling...
<br>
<br>
That pesky high pitched ringing! At times it became so loud it was painful in a way, although it almost always transmuted into a different effect or energy. I even get it in the day sometimes. It is not tininitus either...

It usually precluded an OBE.

 Hi,
 <br>
 I have heard a loud voice calling my name, this generally wakes me up. i've only had one projection but it was a really good one, anyway, as I slowly re-emeged with my body, I heard a beautiful music softly playing. The music sounded a little like a chord organ but it was a more subtle instrument...not of this world
