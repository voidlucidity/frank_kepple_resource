Ooooo-kay. Time to troubleshoot something.
<br>
<br>
This is kind of, under two topics, AP and phasing but bear with me.
<br>
<br>
Okay, last night as I usually do before I go to sleep, I practiced phasing but only managed to do some deep F-10 levels. I ended up rolling over and going to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I woke up around 3am or something and thought, well, it's a few hours before I get up (7am) so maybe I should try focus states again. So I did, and didn't get too far besides feeling like I wasn't there at all and some weird feeling like I was all gloopy like honey, or something. Then I suddenly rolled over, thought damn, then went to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I found myself in a dream later on where I was at my school and was running away from this guy that was trying to kill me with a pinecone  Don't laugh.
<br>
<br>
I was jumping really high and then I ended up running into the school and I hid under a bed in our sick-bay. There was 3 when there are only 2. So I rolled across the floor to the other and lay there until I knew the trouble was passed.
<br>
<br>
I then stood up then looked down at my hands, suddenly thinking, hang on here, I'm dreaming, I think.
<br>
<br>
I then exited the sick bay but noticed hardly anyone was around and it was lighted differently, like after school but everntually, more people showed up but I couldn't interact with them. I was thinking, oops, I RTZed to my school but I touched a wall and could touch it so thout maybe it's a lucid dream. I found some friends and was saying "Hey, I think I'm lucid dreaming but I can't tell", cause I couldn't. It was one of the most vivid dreams I've ever had.
<br>
<br>
I then noticed the school looked older, more worn but saw 2 other girls I knew across the quad so I ran and told them the same thing but then I breifly woke because I was wondering, if it was RTZ, then it can't last too long.
<br>
<br>
After that, I recall feeling vibes early in the morning, around 6am, and cause I haven't had that for like, ever! I thought, rippa!!!!  I'm gonna project, so I kind of swung my legs out over my bed and got stuck. I managed to right myself but my head was kind of still in my sleeping position and when I tried to move forward, I could hardly walk. I tried the "clarity now" technique and could walk but was confused about seeing and then I kept walking back but I couldn't see me on my bed so I thought it must be and RTZ projection so I ended up stumbling backwards to my bed and then I felt a kind of 'merging' feeling like I was going back into me or something and I woke up, late for school.
<br>
<br>
Okay, what happened? And why? Please!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
RTZ projections are not really my thing. I can have them but find the experience not all that interesting. Once you've walked through one wall you've walked through them all, IMO. It sounds like what you had was a typical spontaneous RTZ experience. Finding yourself "out of body" within Focus 1 of consciousness (or C1 in Monroe terms) in familiar but confusing circumstances.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
