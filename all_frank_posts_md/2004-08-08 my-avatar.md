It is a little disturbing.  Slow it down a bit?

I'd say that it's a pretty cool avatar, eventhough I 'm a huge cat lover;)
<br>
p.s. No kitten was hurt right?

I think It's just monstruous, i am afraid of it, maybe because my mind interpretes it as a cat's head with legs. And it is moving so fast....

Some NEG could look like this.

I never thought people would call the little kitty nightmarish.  And unfortunately I can't use that "No kittens were harmed" tagline.

Nothing personal, but if it were down to me I'd ban all Avatars that made any kind of movement. It's simply annoying trying to read a thread whilst having some "thing" jangling about in the corner of the eye. Like I say, nothing personal just my opinion (FWIW).
