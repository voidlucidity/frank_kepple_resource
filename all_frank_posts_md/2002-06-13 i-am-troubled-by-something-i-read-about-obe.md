i read on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///meditationsociety.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
that any form of negative act, be it a perverse thought, an act of selfishness, hostility   inhibits astral projection..
<br>
they say to imagine the astral body as a balloon and that  positive acts fill it,   whereas negative acts deflate it.   This has concerned me since  ive been reading quite a bit on AP and never come across this- can a negative personality really inhibit astral travel??  i admit that i think some things that would be deemed  sick, or hostile to other people, but to me its just an imagination.  What i read made me asses weather there ARE universal laws which we should abide by in order to reach a higher state of being.

I wouldn't worry too much.  First of all, I know many people who astral project regularly who are not perfect yet...of course anything negative, including neg thoughts, have negative effects- but unless you are a completely evil and sick person, I don't think you are going to be inhibited from projected.  The most important thing is that you TRY to be positive and have the DESIRE to be positive.
<br>
<br>
I am even aware of very evil people who can astrally project, of course their motives for doing so are most likely completely negative.
<br>
<br>
By the way, what are the reasons behind having chosen "rodentmouse" as your screen name??

thanks for the reassurance,  the name rodentmouse means nothing really,  but is open to interpretation...

Negative acts and thoughts will not inhibit projecting, unless they are keeping your consciousness focused on your physical body. You can be the worst person in the world and still project. The experience would probably not be that pleasant but still projection would be possible. Your thoughts and emotions effect, or create, the evironment when you are out of body. If you are a positive person you will have more positive experiences, and vise versa.

HI -
<br>
<br>
i think success at projecting has more to do with focused intent and desire. If you are half-hearted about it, you probably won't give it the attempt that you need to succeed. And vice versa.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone else find this? That it is things like intense need/desire and focused effort that allow you to have a good projection?
<br>
<br>
I think we all have good and bad within us. I think 'expanding awareness' can mean both greater consciousness for efforts like OBE, but it can also mean greater awareness of the interconnectedness of all things (including other people!). So expanding one's awareness to how we are all part of something greater (whether that is simply a global society, or a greater communal consciousness)  may naturally lead to less 'negative' thoughts towards or about others.  Greater empathy and that sort of thing.  But it probably starts with self- acceptance rather than trying to change anything about oneself. Don't get too hung up on concerns about negative thoughts.
<br>

A lot of these ideas stem from mystical ideology, 90-odd percent of which I regard as mere hocus-pocus. Thus best ignored, in my opinion. But, again, it's each to their own.
<br>
<br>
The type of person you are on the Physical can, in many ways, determine your chances of having successful, repeatable conscious-exit projections. However, there is no hard and fast rule that says people who engage in (what the moral majority may consider) "evil acts" cannot project, full stop.
<br>
<br>
I would say the best type of character to have, from my 20-odd years of experimentation, is one that remained basically neutral about things in life. That is to say, having the ability to keep one's emotions in check most times, together with an insatiable curiosity about life in general. That way you perform best, both within the Astral and on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
There is one aspect to beware of, however, and that is: people who release uncontrolled "demons" on the Astral, soon end up having those very same entities controlling them - on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

There is something out there in magickal circles called the "Threefold Law."  Meaning, anything you put out into the Universe (for better or worse) comes back to you three times.  The Law applies to the Astral just as it does the physical.
<br>
<br>
I don't "buy" the Threefold Law in its entirety - - three seems a rather arbitrary number, and to adhere to any fixed "Law" anyway is  counterproductive if you want to find out how the Universe REALLY works.
<br>
<br>
But it does seem that what you put out, you get back.  You create your own reality.  Trite-sounding, but true.  So, following this logic, negative, mean people will soon find themselves surrounded by unpleasant experiences once they get to the Astral.  Kind of poetic justice if you ask me.

I dont think negative emotions affect projection as much as fear
<br>
fear can both inhibit projections and cause projections to become unpleasant
<br>
but
<br>
If you get over the fear while your conscious
<br>
You will obe
<br>
If you have fear when you obe
<br>
Who cares as long as you remember it ...you'll always return to your body safe and sound
<br>
so even if its a bit scary or you attract something unsightly, you'll get over it
