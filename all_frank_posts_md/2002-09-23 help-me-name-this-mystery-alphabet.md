<section>
<br>
I had heard of a place on the astral plane that held akashic (sp?) records of everyone's life and past lives.  I found myself OBE yesterday and focused on going there.
<br>
I'm not sure where I landed.
<br>
I was in the middle of this wide desert-like plane. There were hundreds of cave like dwellings. Stone buildings, with square stonehenge-looking entrances.
<br>
There was an entrance ramp to each one.
<br>
On each entrance ramp there was a lot of carved writing in a language I couldn't read. I looked like a lot like Runic writing, but I knew it wasn't. I tried to memorize some of the letters but only brought back one.
<br>
<br>
---&gt;-&gt;
<br>
<br>
It's laying on its side here. This is as close to drawing it in type as I can get.  The real letter was pointed straight up.
<br>
It looks like a Two Headed Arrow pointed upward.
<br>
<br>
I tried to make it up the ramp to go into one of the buildings, but a strong wind kept pushing me back. I gave up and came back to my body.
<br>
<br>
After I came to, I went into my books looking up magickal alphabets, and didn't find a single one that contained this strange letter.
<br>
<br>
My questions are these
<br>
1) anyone know what alphabet this letter comes from? and
<br>
2) anyone had experience with the hall of records? I feel like I was in the wrong place.

See if the rune that is on the right, halfway down, could be a match. The poem is cool, too.

One more:
<br>
<br>
THis is an 'alphabet'  that a guy got from his 'angel.'  The link will take you to a long explanation of the alphabet which I found tedious but you might find interesting ----
<br>
<br>
Click on "Click here to see my AOD" and you will go to his symbol/numerology/alphabet chart. 18 should correspond to the double arrow.
<br>
<br>
He has a symbol he calls a double arrow, he describes it as:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote id="quote">
 <font face='"Arial"' id="quote" size="1">
  quote:
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
  Eighteen is virus , this is only its latest manifestation. I first referred to it as spirit, for the horizontal line of alt 23 is missing. I had already envisioned the meaning of that glyph as Life, with the double arrow symbolizing the man and the horizontal line below it as the URth. It seemed obvious to me that life beyond the URth would be death. That then became the tarot trump assigned to this hieroglyph. I sharing the philosophy of the Imortalist found the prospects of this card to be distasteful, and more appropriately outdated. I felt a new formula was necessary to coincide with the procession of the equinox. Death was the formula of the dying goD, and this was the aeon of the force and fire of life. The aeon of the @M demanded a philosophy more congruent with its own. My uneasiness was answered when I found what seemed like an obvious flaw in the interpretation being used for it. According to most tarot interpreters, change was the key word that seemed to resonate true understanding of Atu 13. This did not appear to describe the heat death of entropy, but rather that of intelligent Negative Entropy (InforMaatian).

Never haveing gone to the akashic records myself I can only report what I have read. As a matter of fact Robert has some stories on the akashic records I beleive he described the area as a large building or structure with collums and large entrance doors.... I have read a few stories from people who have visited the records and they seem simular to that discription but the shape they take I beleive really are up to you. I think your mind constructs what you think they would look like.... to some degree anyway. Robert gives info in his book Astral Dynamics.

Your symbol reminds me of a symbol an entity gave me of its
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///name.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 name.It
</a>
was a 2 headed dragon capable of shape -shifting into humanoid form.This took place on a lower astral plane,close to the physical plane.The symbol is on its side and backwards to what it is supposed to look like.I got the sense that this entity was not to be trusted,although I wasn't afraid of it.                               --U--V--

Leyla,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Those pesky letters are hard to keep in the memory.  Maybe we should try to invent the first mental notebook in large permanent text .
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;    I wish that I could give some additional info other than a rune symbol.     I will keep my eye open on my searches maybe with luck and guidance the answer will be found.
<br>
<br>
When I see unknown text,  I  try to  remember the next thought that comes into my mind to help unfold its mysteries , this  has helped with narrowing the search.  One of the  letters/symbols I saw looks like a "W" with two dots on the top of it but the shape is more rounded on the sides, and others looked  like  :
<br>
<br>
./
<br>
|
<br>
/
<br>
<br>
a slightly slanted line in the middle with a line on the top and bottom curved more to the right.  There was also a letter almost the same but with a body 2 times as long and they seem to flow into eachother.
<br>
<br>
Anyway,  thanks for the book listings I can't wait to read them!

<section>
Hope you don't mind symbology on this.  I very limited on astral and most my experiences occur on ground on earth plane. The sands have been associated with time. The vastness means collective or even a major place. The closest I see to what your looking for as records go may be the broken lines. For "knowing" information to flow into you the lines must be in formation, at this time their broken (not a bad thing). The W is a mystery. I had a dream twice with W presented, it had baseball glove hanging on it, never could figure it. The sands can be a symbol of the aura in physical form. Being a lot of flesh (or vast),so may represent past, many lives, or even collection of many (collective). The many buildings goes to usually the physical body (earth existence).Again, being hundreds could represent the same as past lives, many lives (existences), or again collective (involving more than yourself).
<br>
<br>
The ramp (entry into) is quite interesting,an inclination. The symbols are on the ramp? The ramp would suggest gradual, gradient in regard most likely to your walk or maneuvering onto &amp; into the earth contact body or bodies (suggests physical plane evolving).
<br>
<br>
Since your represented in the astral realm you are meeting with resistence of some kind toward your entry into these earth structures (old, ancient maybe). The resistence is by wind. Earth energy has possible different effect since your astrally located. You return to what you know (physical body of existence). Your learning and the symbol of language is coming to you. The walk where these symbols are located may direct you to something you are to do in waking in a physical way. I would look at your environment in daily living a little closer. These symbols may be waiting for you on in the physical. Can't say where or when,  keep your eyes open and see what presents it's self. I believe all things are connected and if this is a lead (the lines you saw) you maybe be walking into some sychronicity. Are you familiar with synchronicity, signs, oracles gived in conscious momements? You may be receptive or sensitive to these. It's a fascinating living experience. It's like awake astral living.
<br>
The wind on the earth plane has been commonly called chi energy as heard about in the practice of feng shui. In feng shui the air energy is invisible. Your dealing with a more powerful and attention getting power. My personal opinion is God's wind. The wind is blowing you and keeping you from entering this building at this time. Maybe the gradual incline(inclination) is saying to take it slow and gradual. Your astral power may give you added speed not needed on the earth plane business. Your probably evolving. My personal opinion is when the wind blows through you and not against you, your evolving will be more aware and known to you. God's wind carries mysteries and knowing. It may eventually penetrate you. This wind to me has been green (psychically perceived), and trees have been near by. When you see a breeze or wind passing by you during your waking hours, grab some of the psychic potential within it. The wind or breeze wil present itself at an opportune time,what do you want or need at this given time. Pray for the power within this wind while it's there.
<br>
<br>
The double arrow is interesting. It may mean two points, two directions (going the same direction), or two existences (simutaneous). You have potential for living in two worlds or realms at the same time. Earth bound and also spirit living (synchronicity).

Regulars will know that I'm not into any kind of mystical stuff, so it's difficult for me to make exacting comparisons. But I'm fairly sure the fabled Akashik Records are what more modern-day exponents of the art would call The Library at Focus 27.
<br>
<br>
I came across the place fairly recently. It's a HUGE building with a large foyer area. Like a large hotel only much bigger. (I think there may well be any number of foyer areas and the place I have been visiting is just a small section of *many* others.) Leading from the foyer are corridors with one main corridor in the centre that runs for what seems like eternity. Off these corridors are doors leading to reading rooms, and whatever else there must be. I've only explored a tiny part of it.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, I always keep getting sidetracked as Focus 27 exploration for me is still a bit of a novelty.
<br>

Frank:
<br>
<br>
What mystics call the akashic record, seems to be some kind of etheric 'imprint' that the memories of all living things leave. I say etheric as the records detail everything that has happened on the physical plane only.
<br>
<br>
You say that you may have come across it. It certainly has been reported as a large building or library by some.
<br>
I think you would agree though, that the record is represented as such just to make it easier to comprehend and to use.
<br>
Others have experienced it in a purer form, simply a bombardment of images and experiences, but this is hard to asimilate. I think this is why some people find it represented a a library, comple with books etc.
<br>
<br>
It certainly does appear to be a real phenomenom though, rather than some mystical mumbo jumbo (although its description is often clouded by such terminology).
<br>
<br>
Guides appear to make use of it to teach others, it also appears to be used quite a lot for people who have just passed over from the material plane,
<br>
<br>
There are many accounts of guides giving a 'slide show' to NDE individuals, who have later reported this. In their case, the slide show was pertaining to events from their own life.

I'm currently reading an Edgar Cayce book on the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Edgar Cayce has a pretty interesting Life Story.  Long story short, he became known as the Sleeping Prophet, because while asleep, he would *travel* to the Hall of Records (The Library, The Akashic Records, etc.) and would channel information thru his physical body to those who asked questions.  For years, he used this gift to help people with phyiscal ailments ... giving *readings* that contained medical details and cures ... until someone asked about past lives ... and a whole new era of information sharing was born!
<br>
<br>
I highly recommend checking out Edgar Cayce!

Frank,

<br>
Out of curiousity, when you set your intent to travel, do you focus on any particular Focus Level?  For example, when in F10-F12, are you affiriming a strong mental declaration that you want to go to, say, Focus 27?

Hi Leyla,
<br>
<br>
It is amazing that you ask about this, because I ended up creating this very same notebook during phasing.  Here is what happened.
<br>
<br>
I was meditating later that afternoon and another page of text pops into view.  I thought cool, I have to remember the material I read this time and write it down in my physical notebook.  After reading the text, slowly I start thinking of pulling myself back from phasing to write it down and then a notebook pops into view.  It's a normal looking notebook placed right in front of me same as the books that I read text from.
<br>
<br>
I instictly bring my hand around and start writing the material down. .  I could even see my hand holding the pen and going through the physical motions of writing.  I'm thinking this is too easy, I don't feel the usual lethargic feeling of waking out of trance. Something isn't quite right. I must still be phasing in some degree.
<br>
<br>
And then I realize this isn't my normal physical notebook but is the same exact notebook that I just described to you.  The first mental notebook in large permanent text.  I haven't figured out  how to retrieve this notebook at will, I'll have to do some brain storming.  Oh well.
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes,
<br>
<br>

That is what I would have said a few months ago. But this place I discovered is very different. What I mean here is I'm comparing it to the kinds of constructs that you typically come across in belief-system regions. They have a kind of fake quality to them. But this place is absolutely as solid and as well founded as any large building would be in the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Well, I say large building but there is nothing Physical I can compare it to. The place is MASSIVE in construction. If it covered the Physical equivalent of 100 square miles I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest.
<br>
<br>
You see, in the belief-system regions, the buildings (or other constructs) you come across are primarily created from the pooled thoughts of the residents of that region. As I say, many times when you look closely you see they have a kind of fake quality. Like they have been made from cheap plastic.
<br>
<br>
What is very different, in the case of the Library, is I can sense that the construct is formed not from the people I see milling around in there,
<i>
 but from some other energy source
</i>
. What is more, this energy source is radiating with an intensity (yet with a fineness of quality) I have never come across before.
<br>
<br>
I lately discovered the part of the building I have been going to is the part that relates to me in some way. Well, not just to me, you understand, but a whole load of other people besides.
<br>
<br>
As I say, information is very sketchy at the moment because it is all very new. The region has a totally different atmosphere to what I've been used to. Everyone can see me for a start. But what's really freaky is people keep coming up to me saying hello, and introducing themselves to me. Okay, that in itself isn't freaky. The spooky part stems from the fact that all these people know me, personally. Yet I haven't the faintest clue who they are. This has happened to me before on odd occasions but I just brushed it aside. Yet now it keeps happening virtually every morning.

<br>
Yes, that is how it began. I posted on this a few weeks ago where I said about the images I was viewing in my mind. They were like a photograph where you take, say, 4 or 5 frames without winding on the film. Like a bombardment of images, as you rightly point out. Which was hard for me to assimilate. What I did was to ask for clarity. Next I was asked if I wanted to go to the source of these images, to which I relied yes. That's when I ended up in the place that I now know as The Library at Focus 27.

That is how it appears to be. All the people I have spoken to, in this region, know they are dead and all of them seem to be embarked on some kind of information-gathering exercise. Though I'm not sure, as yet, precisely what it is they are gathering information about.

  There are many accounts of guides giving a 'slide show' to NDE individuals, who have later reported this. In their case, the slide show was pertaining to events from their own life.

Yes, from what I have seen thus far, what you say makes perfect sense.

Intent, is the fuel that drives you to various places within the Astral.
<i>
 However, the full effects of this only start to become apparent from the Astral Bridge Zone at Focus 21
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 is the beginning of where thought equals direct action. Therefore, if you put out the Intent, i.e. a strong fixed-thought to be at someplace, while at Focus 21 or above: then, at that someplace, you will become. Whereas, on the Physical, for example, you can sit and think all you like about going someplace; but unless you actually get up and physically transport yourself there, you will remain in the same position.
<br>
<br>
In other words, within C1, thought in itself is not enough. But from Focus 21 onwards, the mere act of thinking is all it takes.
<br>
<br>
What I do is hold the Intent in mind right from the start at C1. After 10 to 15 minutes I recognise I'm at F10. A short while later there is a sensation of drifting in blackness coupled with whirls of foggy colour at Focus 12. Then I totally lose all sensation of the Physical realm as I pass through Focus 15. The colours and whirling fog begin to crystalise as I approach the Astral Bridge Zone at Focus 21.
<br>
<br>
Crossing over the Bridge, into Focus 22 brings the Astral clearly into view:
<i>
 at this point, the Intent I am holding in mind kicks in
</i>
. As it does so, I feel a strong and definite shift in Focus. It's like before I was gradually drifting from C1 through F10, more gentle drifting through F12; F15; slowly the Astral crystalises... and then, suddenly, there is a very definite change in sensation. Everything becomes very direct and to the point, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
As I drift through the various regions, from F22 to F27, I see all kinds of blurred, fleeting images. Like if someone ran a videotape at 50 times normal speed, say. Then, what seems like about 10 or 15 seconds later, everything just suddenly stops at one image of a place. This place, of course, is my destination. At which point I just mentally step into the image and have a wander around.

Frank,
<br>
<br>
You could write a book! In fact, I think you should. Your stories are truly fascinating.
