Out of body and focused awareness are very different to some people.

As you can see, the well-respected Bruce Moen says you can goto F-27 aka, the spirit world, about as much as you want with focused awareness, whereas with obe, if you've read Astraldynamics, you'll notice Robert Bruce has only been there about 4 "precious" times using the Obe method.
<br>
I've also heard many accounts where several people that use hemi-sync have been able to go even farther than that.

There are different ways of experiencing non-physical realms. The most difficult being in the way of a full-blown "out of body" style experience. The reason is because it takes an exceptionally high degree of mental control which generally takes a *lot* of practice to attain.
<br>
<br>
I always say that it's one thing
<i>
 talking
</i>
about entering the Astral by flying through some entrance-structure (such as the one depicted on the back cover of Astral Dynamics) but it's quite another thing to actually
<u>
 do
</u>
it!
<br>
<br>
The Focussed Attention methods of Bruce Moen rely on a series of concepts which are much "kinder" to the individual. With the traditional route, it's a full-on, right-in-your-face experience that's there is no getting away from (except for being zapped back to Physical). The Moen-route is a step back from this. Rather than experiencing situations directly, they are taught to build-up a mental picture from using a number of non-physical "tools".
<br>
<br>
The immediate advantage is that the moment anything starts to go awry, an individual is able to take a step back from the experience and hold it at arms length, so to speak. They are then taught to call on an "interpreter" to act as a kind of go-between. An interpreter's job is to offer advice on how best to proceed, or explain the nature of the circumstance, and so forth. Which is all very much easier on the senses.
