Does someone have the right to search the different forums for people who may have expertise in a certain area without fear of having certain forum members tell him that he or she can't do that?

Dear Sir(s) and/or Ma'am(s),
<br>
<br>
It is requested that you please cease in posting the same topic on every forum. Please delete them.
<br>
<br>
It is not a good way to make friends by flooding a forum.

EDIT: This post originally placed here when the exact same message was placed in all forums. Since then, they have been altered into different posts.

If a person was interested in seriously finding a way to stop negs, and to help people who were dealing with negs, they would not be in any way inconvenienced by the particular post I'm putting on the forums.  The particular post I'm putting on the forums also concerns all the forums, and it is being done to help find solutions to helping people that are hurting.  Plus there are people on the different forums who might hold the answers to some of the questions, but they never look into other particular forums really, so they never have an opportunity to see the questions.  Negs in one way or another affect the issues on every forum on this sight, because their purpose is to try to cause harm to others whether in the astral realm, or OBE experiences, or whether in causing injuries to people so that they have to seek healing of some sort, or whether in intervening in the spiritual planes to cause humans or angels trouble.  These are serious questions posed for the main purpose of seeking to help people, and seeking to find ways to deter or put an end to a common enemy.  I apologize if I have inconvenienced anyone, but there are a lot of people who are hurting out there who are looking for these answers.  If we were really serious about helping people we would not be inconvenienced by such questions recognizing they were being asked for a genuine purpose for the intent of helping people who are hurting.

<section>
In other words Alchimiste, what you are saying is that you are just on the forum to play around and help negs, and don't give a dam about helping other people. Well keep it up, I'm sure you have a lot of negs out there rooting for you.  You're probably their main man, and don't even realize it.
<br>
<br>
And by the way I'm not writing a book, I'm looking for answers to help people that might be hurting.
<br>

You have a good day

Neg rem 5
<br>
<br>
I understand you're keen and want to rid the world of negs and you've done research on various methods etc. but please enlighten us on your own experiences with these negative entities that you are so against, have you, or anyone close to you been affected by one or several of them, now or in the past?
<br>
<br>
You seem so head strong about getting together all the techniques and ways of getting rid of these entities that to me you don't come across as completely honest to the readers on this forum!!! Whats your angle neg rem5? do you understand from first hand experience what any entity actually is? have you had any experience at all in this field?......don't get me wrong I can perfectly understand if you just want to get things going on the forum and accumulate lots of techniques under the same thread but isn't that what the self defense forum is all about? it's an entity in its own right that moves at the pace of those who post, it doesn't need a gung ho "lets solve all the neg problems in one thread" kind of attitude.
<br>
<br>
A site/entity such as this forum evolves, and it's those who contribute that dictate the pace of this evolution, people with problems need time and personal nuturing to solve their particular problems, that's why they visit and post on these pages, to get personal attention. Yes they can all read Roberts book or your superthread that explains all, but where is the personal touch that the neg afflicted or possessed really need?........what's your answer negrem5 to these questions?
<br>
<br>
You need to realise that no one method works all the time on any particular neg, they evolve also (slower, but they do evolve)
<br>
Certain entities aren't in the least effected by christian excorcism, many do not fear jesus or mary or any christian imagery, holy water or virtually anything you care to throw at them, you need a vast and wide knowledge, plus experience to find what works for each particular entity or neg. Please also remember that it is quite commen for some possesions, curses or neg problems to be self inflicted and can more often than not have karmic implications....ie a lesson needs to be learned and to remove the lesson only delays the learning process. You need to be very carefull when considering dealing with any entity that is attached to an individual other than yourself as the karmic implications touch you also!!!....Be warned!
<br>
<br>
Shed some light on this for us all Neg Rem 5....what's your story?

To the twister alchimiste
<br>
<br>
You are good at trying to twist things around, and cloud the real issues.  Your beliefs may differ from me and a lot of the people on this forum.  Apparently you believe in re-incarnation and all negative things happening to someone as some kind of karmic distribution for things they must have done wrong in past lives or the present lives. I believe re-incarnation may be possible, but concening the Karmic theory.  Pardon my french but I think the karmic theory taken to it's logical conclusion is bullshit.
<br>
<br>
If I see someone about to get hit by a moving car, and I have it in my power to dive and catch them and help them live and get out of the way of the moving car, then I'm going to do that.  I'm not going to look by with a ignorant self-righteous attitude, and say oh it's just their karmic distribution to get hit and killed by that car.  If I see a negative wild animal about to attack, kill, and eat another human child, and I have a rifle in my hand by which I could shoot and stop the animal before it kills that human being, I'm going to shoot and stop that animal.  I'm not going to stand by and watch the animal chew the human being in it's teeth and rip at the human beings insides, and just say to myself, oh it happened because it was just part of some kind of karmic distribution that the child did wrong.
<br>
<br>
You said I don't come across as being honest on the forum.  I don't know how much more honest I could be.  Who is the honest person the one that trys to save the person from the moving car, and save the child from the wild animal, or the person who just sits or stands by and watches the two human beings die, and says oh it's just part of their karmic distribution.  How many people do you think on this forum if they were about to die by a moving car or a wild animal, and another human being had it in their power to help them or even save them from the situation, would rather be run over or eaten alive by the wild animal, instead of being helped by a fellow man.  Do you think most people on this forum would watch someone die rather than try to help them, because they believe the person shouldn't be helped because it's their karmic distribution.  Or do you think most people on this forum believes like I do, if some other human being is suffering and we are able to help him, then we should help him in any way that we can.
<br>
<br>
My original questions on this site pose no situation as to an inquiry as to wether or not I'm experienced to ask such questions.  To ask such questions does not even require experience, it requires someone with a caring heart about other humans beings, and who doesn't want to see them suffer needlessly.  But in brief answer to reply about my experience or any encounter with negs.  I have more experience of what negs are like and the harm they can do to people, than you could probably comprehend, and I do not feel the need to tell you about my experience as it is not the issue here and never has been.  The issue here are the questions in my original post directed at sincere people who have ideas or information concerning the questions, which are, ways to force negs out of people that they are harming, tormenting, and trying to destroy.
<br>
<br>
Concerning negs and the particular forums on this web page.  The subject of negs and how to counter them encompasses almost every forum on this web page.  Their are possible techniques for encounter negs in every forum from: astral projection, energy techniques, spiritual development, metaphysics, philosophy, and dreaming.  There are also people in those particular forums who might have information or knowledge concerning negs in that particular field.
<br>
<br>
As far as the personal touch a neg inflicted person needs, there is only one personal touch.  That touch is to get the neg off of him so he is not suffering and in torment anymore, and so he can have his complete life back again.  He doesn't need the touch of someone who looks on him, doesn't raise a finger to help him, and says, Oh it's your karmic distribution because of something you might have done wrong in a past life or in the present life, therefore I'm not going to help you, and I'm going to try to slow down others who might seek to help you also by putting stupid reply posts on different sites to bother them or cause them problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Be warned!  I believe in helping people, not standing by and watching them suffer as certain other people maybe do.

Bottom line its against the "rules" here to post the same topic on every forum no matter how important you think you are.
<br>
<br>
If people want help from negs they will go to psychic self defense forum.  Keep it there or alternate but stop  putting the same damn thread on every forum already.

<section>
Hi Mr. goingslow or should I say the "Master" of the rules
<br>
<br>
<br>
Apparently you are as ignorant, and not minding your own business, as much as your buddy alchimiste is. First off show me the section on this web page anywhere where it list all the rules, and where there is a particular rule that says that you can not go to the different forums to try to obtain new information from people who may specialize more in one field than you can from just one forum in itself.  Show me also where it says that you can not post similar topics requesting similiar information from different forums.
<br>
<br>
Buddy you got a choice, if you aren't interested in the topic, then don't hit your enter button and don't click your mouse.  bypass it and go to a different topic that you are interested in.  You did not create this webpage or these forums.  Everyone who comes to these webpages and forum have a right to seek information that they are looking for, from whatever forums there might be, especially if the information being sought is to help people who are suffering and hurting.  But you probably don't give a dam about that do you.  You're probably some spoiled rich child, or some spoiled adult that doesn't know how to handle money without it giving him an ego where he thinks he runs everything everywhere.  You are probably one of the guys that hurt that poor gal "Spirit Gurl". You just need to mind your own business.
<br>
<br>
I don't know how important you think you are, and apparently you must think that you are real important.  I think what you need to "keep it there" or "alternate" is a foot up your ass.  Maybe then you will learn how to mind your own business, and just stick to the topics you are interested in.  You just need to quit replying to posts that you are not dam interested in, or go astral project and see how many of your "neg buddies" you can help mess with people.  Because only someone who was in league with negs in some way, whether in their attitude or way of thinking would even think to say anything negative about the questions I have asked.  Why don't you think about that for awhile.

<br>
<br>
Histrionics aside: if you look at the list of forums you will see that, underneath the forum title, there is a block of text which outlines the kinds of posts encouraged in that particular forum. Neg issues are normally discussed within the Psychic Self-Defence forum. Though the Welcome To OBE Discussions forum would be a relevant forum also.
<br>
<br>
Generally, it is left up to the poster to use his or her best judgement as to which forum their post would be most relevant. You obviously feel your post has a certain degree of relevance across forums. Which is all very well, as the level of response generally determines the interest. So off-topic forum postings which (by their very nature) hold little interest normally drop-off fairly quickly. Whereas postings that hold a lot of interest tend to remain. That's the natural course of events regulars here have come to expect.
<br>
<br>
I think what is starting to annoy people is how you are trying to, in some way, force the issue by repeatedly editing your post in order to place it once again at the head of a forum: rather than simply letting forum events take their natural course.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<br>
Haven't you realised that you can't tell people they want to get rid of the NEGativity in their lives......it's a choice.
<br>
<br>
stop acting like you are still a soldier; you are still far too narrow minded and inexperienced, try reading a bit more and living a bit more before you tell us all how we should live and react to negs.

Alright guys and gals
<br>
<br>
I don't care what you say to me, I've got a friend who is hurting and in trouble.   You insensatives want to get in my way and cause me trouble that is just fine, but I'm going to still keep looking till I find the answers I need to help my friend.
<br>
<br>
And Alchimiste the only narrow minded and inexperienced person on this forum is you, oh Dictatored one!  I myself am a very open minded person who has experience in a lot of different fields, and I don't go around bothering people who have posted topics and sites that they are interested in.  If I don't like their topic, I don't reply to it, I just bypass it, instead of trying to start things with them like apparently some of you like to do.  A person who was  narrow minded and inexperienced would bother to put a post on someone's topic even when they apparently had nothing good to say, and were not even interested in the topic to begin with.  Does that description fit anyone that you know Alchimist.  It sounds like a spitting image of you Oh Dictatored one.  If anyone has a lot to learn and needs to read more and live more it's you Alchimiste.  And as far as your belief about "negs" go, you can believe whatever you want to believe.  If you want to watch a wild animal attack and chew up and tear up the insides of a small child, then that is your business.  I happen to not believe like you believe, so get over it, and get off of this site if you do not have anything good to say, which apparently you haven't since you opened your mouth.  And what I've said applies to Frank and anyone else on this present site who has said anything negative about another person's topic, when it's clear to anyone who doesn't have their head up their ass that the topic here on this site is a beneficial topic that could help a lot of people who are hurting.  Will you immature asses please leave this site.

Hello Neg Removal5
<br>
I haven't  read all of the drama that has unfolded with your threads, I kind of lost interest after reading half your orginal post and then seeing them repeated I didn't bother  reading at all, I'm sorry because I thought it was all a bit humorous and have posted in regards to it. But now your plight has touched me you mentioned your friend needs help! I can't help but think if you mentioned this earlyer it would have saved us all alot of grief and anger. Maybe you did I'm not sure but if you did it was obscured by anger.... by all concerned. Your request for idea's are noble but repetitve posting unwise when ppl don't know the reason, hopfuly now they do..."your friend needs help" I hope we all can put aside anger and help this person in trouble , not with repetitive posting and not with angery replys but with  open honest help in one forum .
<br>
<br>
Neg Removal5 can you tell us what is troubling your friend and what have you or others tried to do to help so we can all have a heads up on how best to help.
<br>
Again I'm sorry for the pain you must have felt all this time with trying to find help .
<br>
sincerely Paul

<section>
Ditto to that Krome!
<br>
<br>
Neg rem 5, now we have gotton over the foreplay I realise we wont be inviting each other over for cocktails but your friend is in trouble.
<br>
<br>
Are this friends symptoms only when they project or have they passed over to the physical?
<br>
Can you say if it is an actual possession?
<br>
If it's a possession have you found out what type of entity it is? Can you see if the entity is associated with any of the four elements?
<br>
Is there more than one of them?
<br>
Is it possible to comunicate with the entity?
<br>
What have you already tried?
<br>
can you tell us where the entity is residing within your friend (is it any of the chakras?..if so which one and has it moved upwards yet?
<br>
How does the entity manifest itself?
<br>
any small bit of info may help find it's weak spot.
<br>
can you dowse to see if there is any karmic link or is it an indescriminate attack? even if it's karmic you can still get rid of it but the technique will differ and you will need to communicate with it.
<br>
Is your friend male or female?
<br>
What religion?
<br>
when did it start?
<br>
Could the entity have come from an object they bought or were given or came back from holiday with?
<br>
<br>
I realise you are a proud man who wishes to help your friend but if you can give details you will find we all are prepared to proffer the relevent info you will need, then afterwards you can continue to gather techniques for future reference. its your friend that needs help right now....so swallow your pride, lets put our differences aside for a while at least and help you get your job done.
<br>
<br>
I can't say fairer than that!
<br>
<br>
Heres to an uneasy peace

<section>
Okay
<br>
<br>
Let's see if we can sort all of this out.  First off to anyone who has tried to say anything insultive in the last few replies made, all I can say back to you is "insult" back to you.  I can't say more than that right now because I am to dam tired.
<br>
<br>
Second off guys, if a new person comes on this forum and wants to post similiar topics on the different forums, let's just leave him alone, okay!  Can we all learn from the situation that just happened.  If anything let's maybe entertain the new guy and start talking to him in a friendly way on all his different post or sites. Who knows he might offer us a 6 pack of beer like our old buddy kromeknight.
<br>
<br>
Third, let's all agree to even be friendly to those who are less mature than us in age whether they be 13, 14, 15,or 16.  I've noticed a lot of guys on this site like to take advantage of these young people's immaturity, and try to offend them and run them off the sites.  Young people sometimes have a harder time defending themselves than those of us who are already battle ridden from the difficulties they've encountered and endured in life.
<br>
<br>
As I can tell alchimiste has no problem with both attacking and defending, and even counter attacking. He has some skin on him.  I'm the same way to a certain degree, except that I maintain a more to myself profile and don't go out saying things that I know might lead to some trouble or unnecessary confrontations with others, except when attacked in some way.
<br>
<br>
Now goingeasy or goingslow whatever his name is, appears to be more like a sniper, he doesn't like to engage in the long battles that alchimiste actually likes to get into. He likes to get his shot in and then get out of there before re-inforcements show up. He likes to call people wierd in an attempt to invalidate them when he feels threatened in some way.  But I kind of think he is weird if he is anything like that weird flower or whatever that weird thing is that he has as an avatar.  Now Frank isn't the first to speak, but when he sees his other buddies speaking, he then will go ahead and take a shot.  And Risu tries to use more than just words when he takes his shots, he likes to have a very graphic picture to help try to support his engagements.  And GTP or GTE has an immature problem of just jumping into the middle of a situation and having no idea what has transpired between certain people before he blows off at the mouth.  He's 22 you really can't expect more from him than that.  Do you see GTP, that was a defensive comment in self-defense to your intrusion into a situation that you really didn't know anything about.
<br>
<br>
See the problem with two people arguing and fighting on the forum is that others will see it, and where they just happen to jump in and hear portions of it, they then say something at someone, and another argument or fight begins.
<br>
<br>
A good analogy of this is a "bar fight", first it starts off between two people, and before you know it people are fighting everywhere.  Someone just turns around and swings at an innocent bystander, and then another, and then another.
<br>
<br>
But anyway, now I want to get to the two that I'm most fond of in this crowd, Kromeknight and Nay.  They are a couple of "taking it easy" pair, who can play both sides, all sides, and any sides of a situation. They both have a good sense of humor and enjoy a good beer every now and then.  You can't really beat that.
<br>
<br>
I hope I didn't leave anyone out.
<br>
<br>
So how can we sort all of this out.  I think we can do that by all us taking responsibility for our parts in creating these situations and in escalating these situations, and then learning something from what happened, and making a conscious decision to avoid saying certain things to others that we know might be coming across as kind of rude, uncaring, or insensative.  After all if we don't come at people the wrong way, then we can drink beer with them instead of fight and argue with them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, so now we are back at Page 1 again.
<br>
<br>
Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in finding every kind and any kind of techniques or method that can be used to help a person who is being either messed with or possessed by a harmful "neg".
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in anykind and every kind of discussion concerning these issues, even including personal stories of people who may have encountered certain types of "negs" while astral projecting?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay some of you have asked about the person I'm trying to help, well actually it's a couple of people.  But I've learned wisdom over the years.  And I've discovered that a lot of people who claim they have the answers and know how to help people are all talk and no actual "real technique".  If they just left it at all talk that would be fine, and nobody would really get hurt.  But some of these all talk people don't leave it at that.  When they see they are unable to actually help the person who has come to them for help, instead of being honest to the person and telling him, I've tried everything I know and I can't help you, instead they tell the person oh you can't get free because you are doing something wrong, or Oh you can't get free because you don't really want to be, or the reason no one can help you is because you have a karmic situation and you are just out of luck, bye.  Or even though the person is still in bondage, they will tell him that he is free and he just has to accept it (BS).  Because I know how people are who sometimes claim to be experts about things, I will not expose someone who really needs help to such type people, just so they can mess with the person's head and put a guilt trip on them.
<br>
<br>
Many people learn one technique and then they go around saying only their technique will work to help someone who is dealing with a neg.  or a person will learn a few techniques and think he has all of a sudden become an expert, and will become close minded to any other possible techniques in the world or to any other people who might know of and use techniques different from him.
<br>
<br>
There are only one kind of technique that I'm interested in, and that is all and every technique that presently exists that works for sure in helping possessed people get free, and all and every kind of technique that hasn't come into existence yet but will as people use their creativity and imagination to come up with new ideas, new ways, and new technologies.  In other words I'm not interested in the talk techniques or the techniques that make for good conversation but have never actually been successful in helping anyone, let alone a possessed person.
<br>
<br>
Let me just say this I have a person that I know who is for sure possessed.  He is a very strong indivudal and person. He is a middle aged adult grown man.  He just happen, when he was in his teen years, to have moved to the wrong environment at the wrong time, and found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time in that environment.
<br>
<br>
Now are you all ready to handle the truth. How many of you can keep up to this point.  And how many of you up to this point will now have to fall back because your belief structure is to rigid to allow for something that might cause you to have to adjust your philosophy on reality quite a bit.
<br>
<br>
Here it is?  Can a Holy Spirit filled Christian ever get possessed?  Before I tell you more, I want to see where everyones knowledge lies.  I already know the answer to the above question beyond all doubts.  But if you want to share what you think that answer might be, then go ahead.  By your answers I can tell which of you might have information that could help some people I know, and which of you have a belief structure which will not presently allow for such a question.  I will talk about this more after I see your replies.

On a more serious note have you even read RB's practical psychic self defense?  All you'll get here is a regurgitation of his material.. go to the psychic self defense forum and contact Nita.  Go look at the old posts of so many people being attacked by negs and their advice.  They were patient.. look up "need help" or "need" 's posts.

Hello Neg Removal5
<br>
I'm a Spirit filled Christain But have in recent year's been weakened by my own personal faults mainly smoking and the odd beer. When I received the Holy Spirit the desire to smoke or the addiction was taken away by my request, I asked this before I received the Holy Spirit as a confirmation of the lords power within me. I hope that makes sence it was a gift of sorts. I did restart smoking again from my own "free will" after year's of been free from it, stupid I know and now I'm fighting the addiction and giving up smoking to grow strong in the Spirit again. (Addiction is not free will.)
<br>
I'm telling you this for a reason, I'll explain later bear with me.
<br>
I read a book on obe, in it the author describes coming home from one of her obe travels to find her husban asleep after drinking heavily, as was his habit. She  found a neg deeply attached to him and after much effort fought it from him but it said "it would be back because it was invited ". This alone makes me question my own addiction, have 'I invited a neg too' as smoking is no longer my free will and I'm fighting it. I guess I'm saying IMO Spirit Filled ppl can be oppressed, weakened even possessed. Having said that it depends on what one thinks of in these terms. I don't see satan as the horned monster most Christians believe, my view is some what unconventional. I have posted it else were on the forums.
<br>
I have not come across many neg's while AP/obe...I came close  I think but moved away from the area. I have while in lucid dreams battled human forms and also once fought a succub (sp) after returning from obe. But how can all this help your friend. While in my spiritualy weakened state I still know the power of the Lord and surround and myself with his light perhaps this is why I haven't seen that many neg's around while obe. But I do know when I'm near someone in the physical with, shell we say a bad vibe connected to them and funny enough they sence me too.
<br>
So if you fill I can help in some way I will with my limited knowledge. Goingslow made an excellent suggestion and I have some myself but I will wait for your reply.
<br>
Take care Neg Removal5

Well that was a lot of "stuf" to read through  to get to the conclusion. I wonder how many folks you lost under way, but never mind

Just a piece of advise . If you wish to learn from anyone here and ask questions please be nice to them! I have myself, as you , felt slighted by the "club" and have realised that in this forum it seems that you have to "pay your dues" so to speak and become accepted as a member of the elite. Ha well I never got there and still feel that the forum at times is frequented by novices who has Avatar status and lots of stars but seem to have very little maturity, (some newcomers as well actually). In honest I believe they mean well and do have lots of insight and wisdom, but as the Bible says "a fool is known by many words"
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
now dont get offended over again guys and gals no harm meant. Anyway I read with interest all your post (well I had to skip over some parts as it got a bit boring )but to your question. Can a Christian be possessed? Well that certainly is a good question (I assume that this Christian is either yourself or your friend) based on many years of experience I would say, no. Not posessed but obsessed overshadoved influenced and most certainly decieved. Actual posession is quite a serious thing, normally resulting in a compleate loss of control either momentarily or permanently and would require a permission from the victim so to speak. It seems clear from the Bible that Jesus said he would never leave us nor forsake us and that if a person is his he can be no other's. The Holy Spirit cannot habitate a body at the same time as a demon or other spiritual entity. However one need not be posessed to exibit problems and symptoms very closely related. I have had to deal with many such cases as I lived in India and the far east as a Missionary for 15 years and encountered a fair amount of people with such problems. I would ditto the wise post asking for the particulars such as when where how

</a>
the mean time have fun with your posts and your own little private indignated agression. I learned a few things here from the members that maybe they did not even attempt to teach me , mainly "a soft answer turns away wrath but grivious words stirreth up strife" They are a pretty ok bunch, and as decent and sensitive/insensitive as people (including you and me ) are in general. Like someone said Look for the worst in people and you will find it . I like the opposite aspect Look for the good and you will find that too. (oh by the way Going slow you are a bit "sniperish" just face it ok
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I think I recall a comment or two that felt a bit ...whatever Ha) Anyway I would be interested in your viewpoint as you seem to know a lot of things "without a doubt" something I often in my youth claimed but lately have had to revise. So lets reason together and compare notes.

Hello Mustardseed
<br>
I just wanted to clarify my view on this
<br>
<hr noshade="" size='"1"'/>
<br>
Quote# The Holy Spirit cannot habitate a body at the same time as a demon or other spiritual entity.
<br>
<hr noshade="" size='"1"'/>
<br>
we are warned in the Bible to walk in the Spirit so that evil can not touch us so to speak, so I fill this could still happen to some degree in that we might do something against our better judgment and later wonder why we did it at all hence the term "I don't know what possessed me to do that". I haven't seen head spining possessions like the movies only the presence of 'bad vibes' and the fruits their of within ppl. I maybe naive in this as you have had much more experience than me in this area but I believe once joined with God in Christ through the Holy Spirit no one can separate that bond connection , marriage. If we do wrong we answer to the Lord but we cannot be seperated by 'man' because the Lord is faithful and he cannot deny himself, in marriage the two become one. Again I think it depends on the term possession or demons, for me it is the shadow ego that manifest itself until we deal with it but I might be really wrong about that. I am after all basing it on my own self examination and the neg's that wonder the lower astral levels are either a combination of astral projections of ppls shadow ego or disembodied soles that have not one the battle in life over their shadow ego. If that makes sence then everyone has their shadow ego and are dealing with it and these shadow egos might be attached to other astral dwelling  shadow ego's hence possession.
<br>
In conclusion everyone has their shadow ego, Spirit filled or not everyone. I even think Jesus had his shadow ego which ppl call satan.
<br>
I will give you a very personal example of what the Lord showed me only months after been Spirit filled. I  awoke from sleep OOB standing in my backyard naked I was surrounded by bright light I was painful conscious of the fact that the Lord was watching me but I had no control over my actions my shadow was in control and mainifested itself lustfuly. Then my consciousness was seperated from my physical form and I could see  my shadow form in first person view, in this state I was mentaly seperate from  it but I senced it moods, psychi again I had no control as it moved away from the light and over the fence.The experience ended there  but I was shocked by the hole ordeal for years and you all are the first to know of it happening. I've come to realize I was possessed by my shadow the Lord showed me the beast within that I must overcome, the evil in all men even the Spirit Filled .
<br>
Let me know what you all think about this I know it's pretty heavy reading and I hope I explained it clearly.

<section>
in reply to your question on whether someone filled with the holy spirit can be possessed or not..............I would say no it would not be possible, depending upon the level of the holy spirits presence.(that is how much of the body is in resonance with the holy spirit)
<br>
To be invested by the holy spirit is a rebirth of the being on a cellular level, the old cells are transformed by the high vibratory quality of the Holy spirit that causes the body cells to resonate in harmony with itself and thus raise the vibratory frequence of the body.
<br>
At such a high frequency, any foreign entity is unable to resonate in harmony and as such cannot occupy the same space;
<br>
<br>
Where this hypothesis fails is when the belief system of the subject persuades the subject that they are invested with the holy spirit when they are in fact not; they have autosuggested the idea perhaps through religious zeal or misinterpratation of felt energy. As you can imagine this is a very grey and somewhat delicate area of investigation as to question the subjects faith can worsen an already serious situation!!!!
<br>
<br>
Also i agree that most neg infestation is there because they were invited in, not consciously but subconsciously of course! and if ones vibratory level is low then negs can resonate more readily and thus invest their host.
<br>
The Guardian de Seuil or as some describe it as the shadow ego can also have something to say about this matter. I refer you to
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2560" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2560
</a>
a topic posted by Mattias Jonsson that describe the phenomena of this entity that carries ones present incarnation and its desire to attack when it feels threatened.
<br>
<br>
if the subject was involved in an actual and active spiritual progression then it is not unusual that upon reaching a certain level they attracted the attention of certain sects or religious/occult organisations who would send one or more entities to "take possession" of their host inorder to recuperate the soul in order to fuel their egregore.
<br>
<br>
I'll leave it up to you if you want to further this discussion or not, that is of course if any of us fit into YOUR belief system. I have replyed out of concern for your friends and not to prove myself wrong or right in regards to your point of view. So as they say...........the ball's in your court now.
<br>
<br>
ps. If my answer does not satisfy your criteria then I'll happily bow out of this situation and leave you to get on with it as I'm sure you will need all your efforts for the job at hand.

this is heartwarming to see.
<br>
<br>
Now if only those who have posted on the Psychic self defense forum begging for help.  Asking people to give them advice on a neg that is making their life hell got this kind of attention and responses.  Maybe they should have made it a friend with absolutely no detail as to the friend's symptoms.
<br>
<br>
I think negremoval is actually onto something.
<br>
<br>
Btw negremoval dont get all huffy.  You really did get a lot of helpful responses and sincere concern for your friend that at least 20 people didnt get when it was them and they asked nicely and politely.  IF it works I honestly say go for it.

Thank-you Neg5 for the kind words..I am easy going and usually get along with everyone, but Goingslow is right...I had a issue with Spiritgurl and stand by it but that's been talked about enough.
<br>
I have had only two encounters with beings in Astral.  I can't be for sure if they were Neg's or not.  One was a tall guy walking down my hallway towards me..I "thought" he had a knife in his hand..lol..but never did see it.  The whole experience was new to me and I actually thought there was someone in my home.  I woke myself up before he reached the bedroom door.  The second one was a little different.  A woman was standing at my bedroom door sorta to the side, she was looking around the door frame at me.  I wasn't scared this time (not yet anyway) and we just stared at each other for a few minutes, then she started to turn away...I have no idea why I started to say "Hey! what are doing"? took me a couple of tries to get it out...finally the words came out and she CAME AT ME!! real fast with her hands out stretched in a very menacing way.  Needless to say, scared the sh*t out of me!  I managed to wake up (in my physical) when she was right in my face... I was shaken up for a while...a few weeks worth...lol..
<br>
Like I said I have nooooo idea if these were Neg's..I have never seen or had something attached to me...well, not that I am aware of. I also use to smoke and couldn't remember any experiences, so perhaps during that time something happened...it will continue to be a mystery I guess.  I really haven't had any more neg experiences so far..I surround myself with the divine light of God every night just in case..[

Hello Alchimiste
<br>
I read the thread you linked to and can see you know much of the magic path for want of a better expression. I see things from a different view I'm not saying it is better than anyone else's teaching's or deep studies. I was not taught anything that I've posted it has come by way of knowing within myself and personal experience I've  compared it others beliefs for testing and found it rings true for me. I do not ask anyone else to believe me, and in turn I am not subjected to believing others.
<br>
The magic path is not for me but self examination and personal experiences lead me on my path. In my post I experienced many spiritual revelations that were mind alone, personal. The fact that the Bible words were of great help in explaining my experiences as is this link and many other sign post along the way
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.mythsdreamssymbols.com/shadow.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

To tell you the truth Its the same for me..............I have not followed any particular magical school of thought but have worked independantly with certain magiciens.
<br>
I realise it might upset neg rem but Im not at all religous but yes I know there is a god and he/she/??? exists within me, as my name implies I am an Alchimiste (spiritual more than physical)
<br>
I'll post more on the new magic forum if you are at all interested as I beleive in independance and freedom when it comes to magic and evolution.

The holy spirit is just an energy, it's religous dogma that puts a face or image to it, it's the same for all religions.

Hi Neg removal5
<br>
<br>
I've skimmed most of these posts so forgive me if I missed your answers but Alchimiste asked you some good questions about your friend's situation. How about you start there by sharing some of this information with us?
<br>
<br>
What have they tried? How long has it been going on? What caused it initially? Where do you figure in? Have you tried to do any healing on them?
<br>
<br>
Have you read Robert's book? What have you experienced with yourself or your friend? This might make it easier for others to give you some input. It's a give and take reciprocal type of thing--eh?

<section>
Hi to all. Well the questions certainly are out there ha. From my viewpoint there also seem to be certain degrees of possession of the Holy Spirit some people have a lot more HS power than others as they "allow" the HS more control. The HS is really an infilling with the power of God. It also seems to be a very different experience from what Christians call Salvation. A person who is in need of Negremoval can in my view be cleansed in several ways. If the person in question has a strong element of self and personal spiritual strength they can "wrestle" the entity. This follows along the advise that RB gives in his book. This also works well for Christians who feels "possessed" attacked opressed etc especially when abuse is the cause ie smoking drinking sexual perversions etc anything by wich the entity gains control through lust or body gratification. A continual "wresteling" will than always result in a victory, as the entity cannot win if the mind of the Christian is set to do battle. They can only win by persuading you to quit the struggle. Read Romans 7 for further explanation. Paul said "the thing that I do I dont allow oh wretched man that I am". very interesting. The other way is a totally yielding of ones self to Christ by accepting Jesus so to speak and having an infilling of the HS. This often works well with the laying on of hands as well as an annointing with symbolic oil babtism by water etc.This requires a strong effort of "breaking away" from past habits but as it will be within a Christian fellowship it is more a "sticking to" sort of an opposite in a way. The battle becomes more a battle of becoming a diciple, getting busy with prayer service fellowship etc rather that batteling the entity one self . Sort of along the lines of fighting the darkness by turning the light on. This seem to be by far the most effective and instant removal but also requires a strong spiritual alignment with the Christian group or church with whom the individual has experienced the salvation.
<br>
If a person chooses to battle without the Christian symbols and fellowship as a help it becomes more intricate. In most cases the possession or obsession is a result of a choice somewhere in a time line and it is important to help the victim by retracing his/her steps so to speak, and eliminate a vice or do core removal. Most entities that has hitchiked on objects can often not be removed by the elimination of the object, as they often has attached themselves somewhere by the time they are discovered. Prayer seem to bemore effective than core image removal, as there is often no incidents to remove but over time core images can ofcourse be implanted. I have had a lot of succes in adressing the spirit asking it questions and finding its points of attachments that way. Sometimes they will answer in a very vaque or evasive way and it requires a lot of wisdom and spiritual insight to discern what they say. Often they seem to speak in riddles  almost. It is as if they know they have to answer but they try to make it difficult to figure out. Strong entities especially demons and spirits of humans will have a lot more pride and be right up front. In some cases laying on of hands will work but I would be careful in any attempt to cleanse a person if you do not heve their will on your side. I have done this with Kids but adults seem to react often very explosive to that. Fasting helps both the one being cleansed as well as the one doing it. It is very important to be clean yourself . I would not advise anyone to get into a trance in the same location with a person known to be posessed or even oppressed . RB mentions having done this and maybe this works for him but there are several factors to consider that can go very very wrong. Maybe if one is very experienced it is possible but I would never do it allthough I have seen more than most wouls want to see. Well I hope that is a help, it is only my opinions and experience. Like the seven sons of Sceva in the new testament. They were traveling exorsists and started to use the name of Christ and Paul and the Negs tore them to pieces and said "&gt;Jesus we know and Paul but who are you." the name of Christ seems to be useless unless used by a believer in it. I think the vibration is altered somehow. It is like a child wielding a huge sword. One might have a very effective weapon at disposal but it can only be used by someone with strenght/maturity or whatever it would be called.

  Nay, now undressing your post, I mean addressing your post. You may have possibly encountered two deceased humans who had become "negs". I think for sure that the woman you encountered had become a "neg". And most likely the man that you encountered was also a "neg". the reason I say this is because those "entities" gave off vibrations that made you feel slightly scared. If they had of been peaceful entities they would have given off good vibrations, and you probably wouldn't have felt uncomfortable around them or threatened by them. Nor would you have imagined that one of them had a knife. So in summary you probably encountered two negs, and it was probably a good idea to get out of there when you did.

Hi all
<br>
Well seems negremoval has been accepted into the club after all. He does have a way with words dosn't he. Seems there is a joke going on somewhere that is passing over my head. Maybe you all have several profiles and really know each other better than you let on Ha none of my buisness. Anyway is the HS God. Well that is a good question too. If you look in the Bible you will find that in the account of Mary that it says that the Holy Spirit came upon(possessed) her and that the Spirit of God overshadowed her. Allc though I realise that I could bring on a flame storm from Christians it is my belief , first of all, that the Holy Spirit is FEMALE. It seems that the HS possessed mary so that it could use her body for the planting of the seed and that God who seems to be always explained as MALE could have intercourse with her(HS) This resulted in what was the Son of God or the Son of Man as some refer to Jesus. A being equally endowed by the Male and Female element of GOD. I believe that there is a duality for want of a better word in GODS being. It says that "everyone that loves is of God and he that loves not is not of God for God is LOVE" this Love the &gt;Spirit of love is manifest in Jesus and channeled by the HOLY SPIRIT. In a way all 3 are one and yet all three are seperate entities. I realise that this is not a popular belief with some but it is my opinion. It seems to me that God is this very distant being very unrattled and removed. Rarely enterferes and I believe that Jesus approaches him through the HS . So in a way Yes the HS is God or a part of God and certainly works for Him in a very intimate way. Just like 2 people become 1 through marrige childbearing etc. This theory is supportable through scripture if one believes in the Bible. There are however also places where the HS is addressed Male but I believe they might be leftovers from a very male dominated timeperiod as it probably could not be even concieved to the jews that it could be anything but male. Anyway the HS is witgh God at all times and goes out from God and does Gods bidding. Sounds like a good wife. Maybe it even argues certain cases. This whole idea that God is non thinking bliss just sort of a big light hole and that having attained means total peace and in activity seems unlogical to me. I believe God has a personality. Apparently he has emotions, at least according to the &gt;Bible at least. Anyway this new age God seems as &gt;I say as f.x. reencarnation to have become accepted belief systems that noone ever dares to question, and not really logical in my way of thinking.
<br>

To answer the question on what caused it initially is something I'm going to hold off on saying right now. I know exactly what caused it, but I want to hear more about people's views on the Holy Spirit before I explain.
<i>
</i>
<br>
<br>
Which came first?.....The chicken or the Neg?
<br>
<br>
To me this is the crucial part of your friends problem. You say you know exactly what caused it? if you do then this will help formulate the solution, but to hold off on this info until you get satisfactory answers to the Holy Spirit question that fits to your belief system, is to say the least disrespectful to your friends.
<br>
<br>
To know the cause can indicate the type of entities involved.....also how can you be sure it is actually a possession?...What are the symptoms? and how do you know there are several entities involved?
<br>
<br>
You seem to know a lot more about your friends situation than you are letting on.....be frank with us and we'll be frank with you. Come on Neg Rem 5 are we going to fish or cut bait all day whilst your friends continue to suffer.

Neg rem 5,
<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that the faith your friends put in you is well founded.
<br>
<br>
As to me?......yes I'm outspoken, direct and quite often agressive, I say what I think and get to the point which to say the least you do not. Yes I've insulted you on this site and another member kakkarot whose ego was probably bigger than even yours, but when the excrement hits the fan I know what to do, or if I don't, I know exactly the questions to ask to define the problem and who to ask. remember this is about results.. we don't try...we do or we do not.
<br>
<br>
as to your reply you do not realise that the way, place, time, state of the subject and many many other factors that you so conveniently omit from all your posts are the determining factors in removing these entities.
<br>
<br>
I have a question for you...........how much practical work in the field at removing neg entities,manifestations and possessions have you actually got?...is this situation beyond your experience?
<br>
<br>
I must emphasise that I understand your concern and willingness to help your friends yourself but if you want to get results then please please swallow your pride and give us all here the info we need in order to shed any kind of light on this problem......and that includes assholes like me.
<br>
<br>
You seem to want to solve this problem by consulting a public chat forum but without divulging any relevant information.
<br>
<br>
I'm up for giving you any info I can and I'm sure others with experience here feel the same way but none of us can do the maths without the numbers.

I couldn't care less what they think about me, I've offered to help and if they want to go to the doctors and lie, omit or forget to tell the doctor thier symptoms then how can they get treatment......Here's a prescription for asprin and some anti depressants and a sick note so you get a week off work....oh by the way do you have insurance as I charge loads of money for my bovine excrement advice.

  There are a lot of people who have good techniques for removing strong "negs" and can actually help a person get free such as certain mediums, or psychics, or other institutes that have developed some pretty sure techniques.

<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I simply don't know this to be TRUE in my own experience. Getting rid of a neg is NOT that simple and usually requires more than run of the mill psychic/medium abilities. (depending on "what" you are calling a "neg". ie. I don't call a ghost a "neg")
<br>
<br>
Re:Doctor comment (incase you missed it)--I think the point about "the doctor" was to illustrate that in order to get a proper "diagnosis and remedy" you have to be upfront with all the "symptoms" and "history". Anyway, your poor friends are waiting for some serious help and all this useless posturing is preventing it from happening??? [V]
<br>
<br>
Everyone can benefit from the info exchange here. You might not like Alchimiste but is that even necessary? He quite likely has some useful information for your friends as well as others who regularly read this site.
<br>
<br>
May I offer some friendly advice....yes?  [

I think some people are offering/trying to help but you are taking it like it's just being nosy &amp; turning them away. Suspend your judgement&amp; some defensiveness &amp; you might get the answers you seek.

<br>
Peace, celeste

To whom it may concern,
<br>
<br>
I'm impressed NR5, you edit your initial post, including the title, then delete all your responses to those replies thus removing all evidence of your rampant crusade so that you appear to all casual forum readers as a victim.
<br>
You have obviously read your Su Sung.
