Hello all,
<br>
<br>
This morning I used a technique that I learned on here (I believe from Frank) in which you enter the astral from a dream. The technique involves staring at an object in the dream until your reality shifts. I did that, and I found myself spiraling around in another dimension. However, there was no landscape, there were no grids and no people. Just this ambient, dull haze that shifted as my thoughts shifted.
<br>
<br>
I did feel a rush through my body, and it definitely felt like a projection and not a dream. How come I went into the astral but didn't see anything?
<br>
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
<br>
Jeni

It sounds to me that one of a few things happened. You might have been in a void area, or a place between planes. Was it sort of like the black voids only it was hazy? I have been to such a place before. It felt like I was in a fog or something and that nothing else was around. You might have been out of focus with the place you were at and only needed to tune into the place more. Or you might have just gone to a formless plane. Something that I see talked about very little on here and have been meaning to bring up. If everything is just energy then there is really no form only the forms we wish to project. So maybe you were in a an area with on form.

Could you elaborate more on the void areas? What are the black voids like?
<br>
<br>
I felt like I was in a haze with little dots all over the place. It was pretty dark, but the colors shifted slightly as my thoughts changed. All the colors were dull, though. None of the pretty blues and purples we hear about and see in re-creation drawings. It was basically an ambience with dots of a similar color, but either ligther or darker (monochromatic).
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I was just low on energy and couldn't "tune in"?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help so far.

The voids are places that seem to be nowhere. It was described to me as being between planes. It is like you are definitely out of body but are not actually anyway, just sort of in a void. It can be pitch black but the times I have experienced it it is usually sort of foggy.
<br>
<br>
There are many places in the astral, infinite really. Some of which are totally different than anything you can imagine.

Hi Jeni,
<br>
I was in a BLACK VOID once ... during my 2nd of two back-to-back OBE's.  Both were spontaneous, occuring from a very relaxed AWAKE state that developed into a WILD, then into two OBE's ... which spawned my interest in AP.
<br>
<br>
1ST OBE: "awoke" to seeing the ceiling ... knowing that I am laying on my left side and should see the wall.  Floated up and bump-stopped against ceiling.  Saw some pencil writing on the wall, tried to read it.  Moved to it, snapped back into body.
<br>
<br>
2ND OBE: After snapping back, I am in a BLACK VOID ... I see nothing.  I "feel" like I am now face down, so I will myself "up" and away from my Body.  I see a dim gold starburst " * " representing my body.  I move left, knowing that my wife is laying "over there" ... I don't see her ... I move farther left ... there's her dim gold starburst " * " representing her body ... I float down to it, occupying the same space as her physical body ... that was an interesting experience.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I was in a "true" BLACK VOID or if I was just in an internal BLACK VOID between dreams.  Either way, the BLACK VOID I experienced was very real to me.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

Please don't think I'm being facetious, or anything: I think the simple answer is, it sounds like you projected to a place where there was nothing but an ambient, dull haze that shifted as your thoughts shifted.
<br>
<br>
The way to make progress, within the Astral, is to shift your intent. Try to picture a place where you want to go and imagine being there. Then you will feel a mental shift, after which you find yourself in a different place.
<br>
<br>
You tend to find yourself in places, within the Astral, that resonate with your intent.
<br>
<br>
As such, if you projected with no real idea of what you wanted to do. Maybe you had just some wispy, vague notion of being on the Astral someplace. Then you'd tend to find yourself in someplace that's all wispy and vague.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I have u sed this technique many times from a dream in order to project.  In fact, this is the same technique I use when I am consciously trying to have an OBE from the meditative state.  I simply relax, look at the shapes which flash before my eyes, and sooner or later, I am able to latch onto one of them.  By holding onto this image, it starts to become three dimensional and I am pulled into it.  Of course, what this really ends up doing is pulling me OUT of my body, and from there, I begin my journey.
