Has anyone met someone while out of body they didn't know normally and then found a way to be friends in awake time?  Also, is anyone learning about the power of their subconscious and how to get answers to their every day challenges and using their subconscious to program a greater life for themselves?

Hi, I was able to meet two people and have kept them in my life in some way.
<br>
<br>
One person, we both frequented the same message board and somehow I experienced an astral travel to her. We keep in touch through emails every so often.
<br>
<br>
Another I think he lives in Portugal. We communicate with each other astrally. I have been in contact with him for many years. I usually astral travel to him or he sends messages to me while I am remote viewing. He is one of my dearest friends.
<br>
<br>
A third person I met he is an everyday challenge where I need to stay away from him. Don't want to know how he would react in awake time.
<br>
<br>
So have you been able to meet someone on the astral? I wondered if others have had such encounters. I sometimes think I should carry my business card with me so it would make it easier to be contacted.
<br>
<br>
As far as for using the subsonscious to program a better life I haven't been too successful there. Still working on it.
<br>
<br>
Maybe someone may have some insight on this.
<br>

<br>
Go to spirituality, there many info about manifesting into your life. Much wisdom there.
<br>
<br>
I personally view that to advance spiritually one does not need to be a hermit and live in a cave![

Goodmorning Lyn, I only recently had a lucid dream out-of-body experience and only went as far as my hallway.  Three years ago, when I first began to practice, I was able to go out a couple of times and it was fun and then I got away from practicing and had to start over.  I'm glad I started rereading Robert Bruce's book again to see the dangers in trying to rush some things. I have not developed enough to go out consciously and be in control though that is my goal. So, no I have not met anyone.  I read in one of my books and then sylvia browne's book about life on the other side and the books tell about merging.  Sounds great to me, especially if it would be with a life partner.  I know I go out-of-body when I sleep and many times I can still remember the experiences because they were so dynamic but I desire to go out-of-body at will and be in control and remember it.  I would rather go out in real time because that is what I know and there is so much to see now.  Later, going somewhere else would be interesting because I would write stories about it.  I think a lot of the novels and movies we have now days may have come from people visiting other relms.  I shared on another thread about a book that has changed my life for the better (and pretty fast).  It's called "The Power of the Subconscious Mind".  I had learned over the years about the power of our words and how they affect our lives but I had it backwords.  It all starts with thought and then comes the words.  There is power in both and we use them all the time but when a person gets a revelation as to delibertly choosing to control both, then there life will change for the better and greater.  I am experiencing more peace and joy and prospeity and power in my life now than ever before.  By following the truths in the book it makes you feel and know that you have the power over and in your life by your thoughts, words and actions whether they be positive or negative (positive is best...negative is easy and how we have mostly led our lives)  Anyway, you seem to be more advanced in the out-of-body travel.  Have you always been able to go out or did it take years of practice?

In my experience, people within the Astral look very much like people look when Physical: whether they are projecting or are resident there. Though what I cannot tell you is if a person's appearance changes at all. This is because I have not had the experience (yet) of meeting a person within the Astral (projector or resident) who I knew on a face-to-face basis while Physical.
<br>

Yours,

Hi Alvina, I am not familar with Slyvia Brownes book on merging I really would like to hear more about it. The one book I remember reading of hers she mentioned a Healing from the Otherside which I had a fantastic visual experience. Also this book "the power of the subconsious mind" by any chance do you have the author of this book. I have lately been trying to program myself with positive thoughts because I am surrounded by so many negative people where I work and being an empath this really is hard for me.
<br>
<br>
As for astral traveling I started in 1992 but when I first started I only stayed on the ceiling and I couldn't move. I would try and push myself away from the ceiling but my astral self wouldn't budge which was scary for me. Every morning waking up and there's the ceiling. It's funny now but not then. I would have loved to walk down the hallways first.

So after I told myself I need to get past the roof or give it up that was it, I've been having OBEs ever since.
<br>
<br>
So with daily practice soon you will be traveling like before and I hope you find this life partner. Keep us informed.

Dino333, When I was OBE I saw my reflection in a window pane and I looked like I was in the physical. I was surprised that I had a reflection. I also felt solid because I was able to touch the glass and look out into the yard. Others that have seen me swear that I was standing in front of them and the next second I was gone. When I interact with someone in the physical and I am in the astral they look normal and feel normal to me and it's only been for a short duration.

Hi Lyn,  The author to "The Power of the Subconcious mind" is Dr. Joseph Murphy.  You can find a copy at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.buy.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.buy.com
</a>
.  When I bought a bunch for presents, I paid no s&amp;h at that time.  It may be different now.  The merging I first saw in Astral Projection by Denning &amp; Phillips.  It's called something else in that book but I won't say what on this site.  Sylvia Browne called it merging but no matter what it's called, it sounds devine. No physical limitations as in the physical relm.
<br>
I'm curious about a lot of spiritual things or metaphysical (my opinion is they are probably the same, just different titles).  Anyway, I tried dowsing years ago and it worked for me but it wouldn't work for a friend of mine.  I tried pendelums and that use to work for me and now it doesn't seem to.  I'm back to experimenting with the dowsing rods (made from hangers) and they work great.  It's like having a direct line to my subconscious or my spirit without having to take a nap to get an answer. I wrote a yes and a no on a piece of paper and taped it to the wall and use the rods. You have to be very careful on how you word the questions in order to get an accurate answer.  Some questions did not get a response and some got true yes and no answers. I don't need to rely on this method for directing my life but it is interesting to see how it works. I read that people could get a board that requires 2 people but I messed with one of those when I was a teenager and I wouldn't now.  Now I know that my subconscious is answering my questions and I do not need any dark energy types messing with my life.  They have no part in me! I choose to have a mentally, physically and spiritually healthy life and there are just some things I won't mess with.  I look forward to flying without an airplane (not only in my dreams).  Have a great day.

Dear Amy, Thank you for that web site you listed.  I have gotten great and interesting information from it.  She says though that a person has to be asleep in order to project and yet I have read of people who were driving or walking and went out of body (they got right back in though).  I think perhaps each person who writes and teaches on subjects give there own perceptions because that is what they experienced and perhaps believes that is the only way to do something.  Have a wonderful and blessed day!

Hi Alvina, when I started getting interested in metaphysical I used to love to hang out in an ole book store and this is where I found books titled Mind Cosmology by the same author Joseph Murphy. The books were really enlightening. I've gotten away from this type of practice and really need to start reprograming my subconscious mind for positive results.
<br>
<br>
I've used Rune Stones, Tarot, Angel Cards. I also do my own astrology charts. As for the pendulum I used it a few years back and recently started using it again. I used to write down the alphabets and it would spell out letters. My coworker &amp; myself would try to locate missing persons, I also used Yes/No/Maybe to get answers. I bought the set at the bookstore, a plum and book and used a 6" string. A few times earlier this year I used the pendulum to try and locate a kidnapper and a crazed shooter. I used a map and charted the route with the kidnapper and sure enough I was very accurate. With the shooter I would remote view and use the pendulum &amp; map and had the area where his next shootings would be but then I wasn't sure if it was accurate until he actually was there. I had seen Slyvia Browne and two other psychic a few years back on tv and each used their psychic abilities to locate a murdered victim, one used the pendulum and map. I still need alot of practice though but this is one of the tools that I am trying to perfect. I'd like to get into this line of work using OBE and RV to locate missing persons. I've practiced using all the sixth senses and am fairly good at it but sometimes I find it hard to close off from other people &amp; spirts so a good book to have is one on Psychic Self Defense if you get more involved.
<br>
<br>
I read your message to Amy about projectors having to be asleep when it happens. I am a Remote Viewer and I am fully awake when I start to view and then have a fully conscious OBE. I read here at Astraldynamics that it is a weaker way to OBE but for me it is very easy and I usually can remote view most of the time within minutes, and mostly at my set time which is after 9pm. (after lots of practice) Like last night I decided to remote view, after a few minutes I saw a table and focused then saw two guys sitting at this table. I remember seeing this same table two weeks ago so I decided not to continue to focus and pulled away and just canceled the viewing and went to sleep. I read a few posters here which have also meditated on the crown chakra and either did or are close to having an OBE.
<br>
<br>
It's a sight to see when your able to travel over roof tops and trees and cities. I never know in which direction I'm traveling so that is also something to work on. I know I've been in New York, Italy, England and over the meditterean sea.
<br>
<br>
So I wish you a speedy OBE. Enjoy.
<br>
<br>
