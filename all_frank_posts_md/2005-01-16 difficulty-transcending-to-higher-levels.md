I've projected about maybe 4 times for certain, and all the other times were hesitation on leaving my body. The last time I projected was a couple days ago when I separated after having heavy vibrations. I knew I was out, I just couldn't see anything clearly. It was all jumbled and very dark. So I did what I've read you're supposed to do when astral vision is weakened. I asked aloud to be able to see. It seemed to work but I had a lot of trouble moving away from my body or really even comprehending things around me. It was all a jumble. And then I suppose I fell asleep. Can anyone give me advice as to how I'm supposed to move away from my body? I've heard moving away helps you see better. But I can't keep my mind straight enough to really figure out how to move away.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
You perhaps need to gain more familiarity before things start becoming clearer to you. But the most basic aspect you need to understand is: what you are attemting to do is enter into realms of
<i>
 subjective
</i>
reality. As opposed to the normal objective (physical) reality that you are used to.
<br>
<br>
Within subjective reality, we tend to become our state of mind. Therefore, confusion, for example, will have you in all kinds of confusing circumstances. In a sense you could say that whatever is within us, becomes outside of us. A person may, for example, have a fear of what they might see. So they end up just fumbling around in the dark. Or they might have a fear of entering what they see as the unknown, and so they find it difficult "moving away" from their physical expression.
<br>
<br>
Because we are in the habit of being within objective reality, when entering subjective reality we continue to objectify our experiences through habit. Which is why, for example, people publish notions such as, "Moving away from your physical helps you see better." It's not so much the act of moving away that helps you see better. It's more like if you can gain the clear presence of mind to move away, in turn that will create the circumstances where you can perceive with more clarity.
<br>
<br>
In your case, you say,
<i>
 "But I can't keep my mind straight enough to really figure out how to move away."
</i>
It is the fact that your mind is in a turmoil that is creating your confusing circumstances. So you don't need to "figure out" anything. All you simply need to do, is clear your mind. Then you will
<i>
 automatically
</i>
create clear circumstances for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I find it helps to have an intention of place and action before I begin the projection . eg I will go to Penny's house to pull her toe and remind her to come fly with me . Don't laugh . my daughter Sveta did just this . My closed circle wanted to project together from the dream state to a spirit classroom Â . So we agreed upon a place and time . Sveta was our alarm clock as she was the best projector .
<br>
<br>
So try sitting up in a chair to prevent sleeping until you have mastered projection
<br>
and
<br>
Try stating your intended place and action aloud before you reach the meditative state and begin to project .

Thanks for the replies, guys. The only thing is I never choose when I project. I just happen to do it every now and then, and they're spaced very far apart. It's so completely random that it takes me by surprise so I never really have a firm objective when I do actually manage to do it. And I'm not sure I could project while sitting up, I'm a very lazy person...

More energy helps to clarify what you are experiencing and makes it easier to let go of any obstacles you may be holding on to. It also helps to move up to higher parts of the astral and then higher planes above the astral. More energy makes your concentration and intent stronger. When you raise energy, the thoughts that come to your mind during that time are probably connected to the obstacles you are hitting because you have enough energy to stimulate them. This can show you what kind of things to let go of to get past them to higher energy levels. At that point you will bump into something else, but you will be better off and having clearer experiences already.
