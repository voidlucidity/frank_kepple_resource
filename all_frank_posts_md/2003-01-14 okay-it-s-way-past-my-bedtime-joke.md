It has been reported that Osama bin Laden was captured this morning at 4:22 AM Pacific Standard Time by US Special Forces.
<br>
<br>
The prime suspect of the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, bin Laden, was captured at gunpoint, as he fled an underground passage in a remote mountainside of southern Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>
Alliance troops, who witnessed the events unfold, explained that moments earlier United States war planes had sprayed liquid Viagra across the southern Afghanistan countryside, and the little prick just popped up!

English humour... can you credit it guys &amp; gals.
