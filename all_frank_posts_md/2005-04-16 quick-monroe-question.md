Hi there!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I recently ordered Monroe's 3 books from Amazon. I'm currently reading 'Journeys Out of the Body,' although it is somewhat torn and rumpled- as my dog decided to open the package herself one afternoon before I returned home.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow... I know that Monroe is deceased, and I just passed the point in the book where it speaks of his strange plane/death situation. In his notes, it stated that if he did, indeed, die on his trip, he would try to communicate with those that were interested.
<br>
<br>
My question to you is- After Monroe died back in 1995, was he able to get in touch with anyone? Is he still communicating with people?

<br>
<br>
I realize that no one may know the answer to that question, but I thought I'd ask just in case anyone did- or just in case anyone has actually met Monroe while out of body.

I'm now about halfway through 'Far Journeys'... and, to say the least, I'm REALLY confused!
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
He's describing all of these situations... Am I supposed to take these as literal? Did they really happen to him? Because they're (like the one with AA and BB) written like they're stories... not like actual occurrences in first person. (Is he observing these 'rotes' or experiencing them firsthand?) Does he go on to explain these later in the book? I feel like I've been dished a ton of information with no explanation. Also- what about these words and definitions... Did he make them up? I'm having a hard time understanding all of the 'smoothing,' 'turning,' etc... And in one of the scened, AA says to the little form, "You don't know what a rote is?" like maybe 'rote' is a common term where he lives. ALSO- why is it all in English? How was he able to perceive these words? Is English TRULY the universal language?
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
Any help in understanding this will be appreciated greatly.

I'm sorry if I haven't made much sense in explaining my problems, and I also apologize if the answers to all of these questions are blatantly obvious.

Thanks!

P.S. - Did Robert survive his wife? I was wondering this because of that situation in the book.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The problem with Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey is you have to have some experience to understand them. Which is great, in a sense, because when I read them, for instance, I found them a great qualification for my experiences. But if you have only a little experience, then you are going to have to read it all and bear it in mind for when you do get to that stage.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

When I went to The Monroe Institute in 2002 I was fortunate to have one of Monroe's step-daughters (Penny) as a trainer. Towards the end of the program I was talking to her about a person who claims to be in contact with Monroe. I will not say his name so as to not start a potential conflict, but her response was insightful.
<br>
<br>
This was a little over 3 years ago so my memory may be fuzzy. She basically said that nobody has had contact with him (to her knowledge) and that if he wanted to contact anybody on the physical plane, he would find some inventive way of doing it. She said that he might someone do something with a computer or other technology, I guess somehow messing with the bits and whatnot and make a message. From the way she sounded when we were talking, I assume that she feels he is somewhere too far out there and is either not able or doesn't want to come back close enough to us to make contact. She also said that when she does programs every now and then people will come up to her claiming to have talked with Monroe or her mother and state some "fact" about them that they learned while in a focus level. Most of the time the info is wrong, but the people to whom it happened are convinced. Penny seemed to think that they met someone or something while out there, but that they someone subconsciously influenced the event and they misperceived what was going on.
<br>
<br>
Remember, this is all from memory of a talk I had about 3 years ago, so don't hold me to any of it.

One more thing...
<br>
<br>
Laurie Monroe was there but we didn't interact with her on a personal basis as much as we did with the trainers, so I didn't ask her about it. I see now how that could be an interesting discussion to have, but back then I was too worried about why I wasn't having any experiences to discuss a potential Monroe contact in any depth...
