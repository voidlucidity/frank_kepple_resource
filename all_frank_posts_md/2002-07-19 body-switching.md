<section>
Is it possible to have an oobe at the same time as someone else (a willing participant) and go into their body instead of yours and vice versa for them?
<br>
Even though it may be possible is there an ehthical problem here?
<br>
Tell me what you all think!!

<section>
it's probably possible, but most likely it will only be able to be done by the powerful and experienced or those with natural skill.
<br>
<br>
no ethic problem if you are both willing.

Nah I dont think so.But maybe like kakarot said if you were an expert with tons of experience.From what Robert says in his book.The body isnt left empty.When we leave its just a copy of us that goes.The root of our excistance lies in the body..Maybe someone else can explain

having trouble remembering the rest at this moment.
<br>

I think its like a key.If someone else tries to get in your body.They wont be able to open the door.They might be able to look through the window though.

Hi, Hey, Hello
<br>
<br>
I'll pick up the baton for you matee, I'd like to believe we are in a world/ universe where anything is possible &amp; who knows, for some reason someone might find a way or has a way to do what you suggest.
<br>
<br>
However as pointed out in the last post, RB &amp; other authors believe we have a projectable double &amp; an original copy is kept in the body (etheric body) until the time of physical death. So even though the two participants wish to be inside anothers body ( like the movie "being John Malkovich", not exactly I know) there would be a problem in the real life, as the ehteric body would probably perceive it as a psychic attack &amp; would put up it's natural non-physical defences e.g. the complete waking state.
<br>
<br>
There is the cases of possesions also, but they seem to be co-inhabiting the same body &amp; have struggles for control as opposed to someone else having total control of your body like Freddy Kreuger or something.
<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe somewhere, sometime, but the only ethical problems I see that could arise from this is, 1) Nonmaleficence :  that is , if it was developed somehow or allready exists as a technique, it is not used for causing harm to others. a) the exemption would be; in defence of yourself or family from attack. This creates an ethical dilemma also, as we know, history is replete with examples of when the defence of something is taken to it's extremes, when coruption &amp; self interest blur the lines of the original concept, which was preventing harm.
<br>
<br>
2) Beneficence : That is, if it is possible to do it ; it should only be used for doing good, anything else would be an attack on the fabric that holds us together as communities &amp; makes us co-operate with each other for the good of all.
<br>
<br>
Everyone would like the freedom to do exactly what they like, when they like, but we are forced to conform with laws set by society, otherwise there would be anarchy, so it IS worthwhile examining the ethical problems associated with going into someone else's body, even if it has not been proved in the physical world.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys all

<section>
<br>
Your Astral/Spirit/Energy/Etheric body, call it what you like (personally I prefer Spirit body but tend to use the term Astral on this BBS) has a biomagnetic attraction to the physical body which is how it manages to stay in alignment as the physical body moves around.
<br>
<br>
Your Spirit body also has a unique biomagnetic signature that precisely matches the signature receptors of your physical body. As such, I cannot see how another spirit body could possibly take over another person's physical body.
<br>
<br>
Of course there is nothing stopping two people trying to swap physical bodies. But, as none of the signature links would match, there's no way they could possibly lock into alignment.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<section>
I seriously doubt it.  I'm hardly an OBE expert, but one of the reasons I feel comfortable enough to overcome my OBE fears, is the understanding that it's not possible for somebody to come and inhabit your body.
<br>
<br>
Plus, that just lends itself to a host of philosophical questions like, "If they do successfully switch, what happens if the physical bodies wake up?"  Most people have a hard enough time projecting as it is, I can only imagine how hard it would be to project if you were in someone else's body, trying to fix the mixup.  And what happens if only one of you makes it, and that physical body wakes up?  Does the other projecting person have to watch in annoyance as the other person is using their body?  Would people be able to wake up the body that didn't have an inhabitant?  (Although it always does have an inhabitant from what I understand, it's never empty)
<br>
<br>
As for ethics, If it's 2 consenting adults trying something, and nobody's getting hurt, why not?  (But then again, that goes for most everything in life.)

<section>
I think the closest to swapping bodies one could get to is cohabiting the body. And event then it would require the cohabitee and cohabitor (hmm can we come up with a goo terminology here?) to be very close and trust each other perfectly, something that is rare in the extreme these days.
<br>
As for waking up while cohabiting someone else's body I'd think the astral body would snap back to one's onw body the instant the physical body becomes fully awake.

<section>
nice answers everyone. but to everyone who says that each body can only be inhabited by the spirit that is in sych (or whatever you called it) with it, i tell you this: the spirit can be manipulated and given a new "biomagnetic signature", as Frank called it.
<br>
<br>
the spirit isn't like a block of wood; you don't need a sand blaster or a chain saw to mould it. it is more like sand; you can mould it and it will stay in that shape until you let it go. you just need to know how to mould it.
<br>
<br>
i have been learning a technique as of the past few months where i can change the feel (or signature) of my spirit. this may come in handy some day when spiritual tracking methods may be employed against me. i know for sure, that one way to track someone or establish a link of communication (psionic or spiritual, i don't know yet. but i am heavily thinking spiritual) with someone (astrally, clairvoyantly, etc) is to know how their spirit feels and to search for that feeling. i have done it with mixed results.
<br>
<br>
so by changing your spirit's essence (and i certainly don't recommend this for newbies) you may be able to effectively give your self a "key", as alpha said, into someone else's body.
<br>
<br>
but this is all theoretical, since i can not oobp and i have never heard of anyone doing this. (but just cause i haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it hasn't happened)

I dont really know man,I like to think that we are living in a world with endless possibilities.
<br>
<br>
But no reason to worry about someone running away with your body.Ive actually seen my body getting  up and dancing around with my girlfriend.Right after flying out spontaneously with my astral
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///body.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 body.In
</a>
a sorta lucid  dream obe,so maybe that was the message.
<br>
<br>
I thought I was going to hurt her.Because I had no control of that body.And I thought maybe someone else was in there.
<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it after I read this thread.
<br>
<br>
Maybe thats what the dream  meant.That the only person who can steal  my body is me,the real me.The higher self

I looked around I couldnt find the actual
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///thread.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 thread.So
</a>
i cant really tell you what I think about that.But all i can say is people get the wrong ideas on things all the time.Including myself ive had so many diff. views on so many diff. things.And you read my post.I could of interpeted that differently.
<br>
<br>
I actually did think someone stole  my body for a bit.If I didnt stop thinking that way.I just would of gone further and further.Who knows where I would of went with that.Most likely no where nice.
<br>
<br>
Im not really saying its false.What do you actually think about it?Even though I have not read it.I know how everything can be twisted so easily.

About the link "TX gal and trading bodies" that I mentioned above, here is the way to get it:
<br>
1. Click "links to related websites" on the main page. It will bring  you to another page.
<br>
2. Click on "Discussion Group" link, and you will see all those threads.
<br>
<br>
What I think about it? I think that it is possible, but also, in case of TX_gal,  it can be a fairy tale. People can be very imaginative.
<br>
<br>
By the way, Monro in one of his books describes the world in year 3000 where people use physical bodies almost as we are using clothes now.
<br>
<br>
Good luck,

Hey did you read the thread where she admits she is a terrible liar in the real world?but not
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///online.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 online.So
</a>
its really hard for me to believe.What you are in the real world reflects on the astral.
<br>
<br>
I dont know but im not going to believe in anything blindly.Because it will effect me in one way or the other.Thats why I asked you what you thought on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///it.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 it.It
</a>
matters only what you think..And if it was possible.Why wouldnt RB say something of it in his book?And not much else on the subject.
<br>
<br>
If it can be done.I think it is only if that other person is willing.She sounded like a  newbie,like me.Shes talkin something about  her cord being severed for a sec,cord switches?I  really doubt that one.Something like that only happens in death I thought.I didnt say she was a liar,she said it herself.

Ah I had to come back here,I had a few more thoughts on this.On why the future could be like that.If people  ever learn that all these religion systems.And all these rules that we grow up with.All those certain standards for everything.If people start  to open their eyes and realize they are dreaming a nightmare.
<br>
<br>
And one fine day we go back to the hunter,gatherer lifestyle again.Ive read some things that point to this in the future.
<br>
<br>
We would all be our higher selves. Their wouldnt be anything to separate us.We would finanlly be one.We are in a sense.But not completely.
<br>
<br>
Than body switching could very well be possible.Hope this makes some sense.
