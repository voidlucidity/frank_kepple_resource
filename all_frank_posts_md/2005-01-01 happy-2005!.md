Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I would very much like on behalf of myself and the moderators of the Astral Pulse like to wish everyone a
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 <b>
  Very Happy New Year
 </b>
</span>
[/b]
<br>
<br>
As we all know, the concept of "time" is purely a human construct relative to the physical plane on which we live; time, in reality simply does not exist, there is no past, present and future, there is only
<b>
 now
</b>
.
<br>
<br>
We all create our own realities by what we do in the
<b>
 now
</b>
, so if you do make a new year resolution make it your own
<b>
 now
</b>
to create the reality you really wish for, maintain that
<b>
 now
</b>
and that
<b>
 now
</b>
will become your own reality. Thinking about things that "happened" before
<b>
 now
</b>
will only hold you in the past, and likewise thinking about what you would like in the future will hold you in a perpetual state of wanting and never receiving.
<br>
<br>
We are all expressions of The Source, The First Cause, of God Who is absolute perfection and cannot be improved in any way whatsoever, no matter how people perceive things should be different, and any attempt to improve perfection will instantly subtract from you as an expression of that same perfection. God is perfect, and we are all made in the Spiritual image of that perfection. We are all here to evolve to that same perfection on an individual level; that is the true meaning of life.
<br>
<br>
So for this first Earth day of the Earth year 2005 know what you wish for
<b>
 now
</b>
, know it is already in you reality
<b>
 now
</b>
, always maintain it in your
<b>
 now
</b>
and soon you will become aware of, experience and enjoy it in your own
<b>
 now
</b>
.
<br>
<br>
Remember,
<b>
 There is absolutely nothing you cannot be, do or have!
</b>
<br>
<br>
I have alot planned for you in 2005 including the launch of brand new site which will compliment this one perfectly, and also the re-design of the main pages of the Astral Pulse. I also intend to bring various products to both sites which I am sure will be of the maximum benefit to everyone.
<br>
<br>
Thank you once again for your much valued contributions to the Astral Pulse, only think in terms of
<b>
 now
</b>
, expect success and realise that reality that is really you.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Thanks Adrian, a happy new year to you as well!
<img alt=":o" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
<br>
<br>
I look forward to all the additions to the site.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to say that out of all the obe/astral related websites and forums out there, this one is without doubt the best, due both to the dedication of the people who run it, and some of the top quality input of those who participate in it. for this reason i have been glued to this site since 2001.
<br>
<br>
Of course there can be problems from time to time, but this site still exceeds all other related ones by *far!*
<br>
<br>
I wish everyone on the forums a great new year and I look forward to all the fun in the weeks and months ahead!
<br>
<br>
Douglas
