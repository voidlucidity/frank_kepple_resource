Hi all,
<br>
<br>
I began some phasing experiments last night, after getting my commentary under control, started to get some quite clear images coming through. Mostly they were people looking at me, kinda made me feel like a bug under the microscope. LoL. It felt a bit like I was being scrutinized in Â way that you observe a bug that's hatching from a cocoon

<br>
Anyone else ever get this feeling ?

Hey Steve,
<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes when I'm meditating I get into this state where I start seeing random faces staring at me, and like almost studying me. I've seen a ton of famous people, and it's all very detailed. I saw Jesus once, and seeing him made me go into a deeper state... good luck!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
One of the most eerie aspects of the Monroe focus 12 state is you can start to see all manner of random images that can be translated as being faces. Plus, all of us have many, many aspects of ourself located in Focus 2 of consciousness of my Phasing Model (that I loosely translate as a wider Monroe focus 12).
<br>
<br>
Within Focus 2 of consciousness you can meet up with all manner of aspects of yourself, or what is quite common is you
<i>
 become
</i>
different aspects of yourself. In other words, it is possible to view these aspects objectively or we can "step into" them and become them.
<br>
<br>
Also, within Focus 2 of consciousness you are in the position of being able to objectively view the internals of your own mind. You can view any thought, belief, etc. In fact, anything you think about will become all around you. So religious types tend to view all manner of religious scenarios, people who believe in devils and demons will engage in whatever devils and demons do, etc.
<br>
<br>
Focus 2 of consciousness is also the region of consciousness mystics call the Astral. So depending on your beliefs about that you can have all manner of astral projection experiences, experience all kinds of different "levels" and "planes" etc. Basically, whatever you believe in, that is what will come about. Simply because you are focused within the area of consciousness where your beliefs are held.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Tony,

Thanks!

Yep the Images are still pretty random at the moment, tho in last few days I've been noticing that the quality of the images is improving. When I began trying to induce a trance state last week the images were really quite insubstantial/ unfocused, tho at the w/e they were becoming really quite sharp

The other thing I've found is that my normal dreams are becoming more lucid, becoming easier to recall when I wake up... But it's early days yet

# To be honest Frank I don't know anything of the Monroe model at all

(other than what I've been reading on the forums here), So it's really a case of starting from afresh. When I did the training course all those years ago I was taught there were the 7 levels of 7, that was about it, so according what's been written here is it was just the old way of doing things. You mention the different aspects of yourself, I've noticed that alot of the faces that have appeared have been smiling in a knowing sort of way, it feels a bit like meeting up with old friends even tho you haven't consciously met them before.

#Whoa!

I can become another aspect of myself!?

# I can't say I've considered myself to be a religious person really, although I've spent alot of 'time'(relatively speaking) studying what the various religious texts have had to say about reality, the purpose of being here, etc. But after all this study I can only conclude that what they've achieved is subject to relative belief constructs of the 'time' that they were written. Having said that, there is alot to be said for the direction to which the writings are pointing to, tho the thing I've found so frustrating is having to wade through this almost endless waffle to get to ant sort of 'objective truth'

# One of the things I find so interesting/appealing about your 4 focus levels approach is it's relative simplicity, as opposed to the religious/mystical approach. I'm really looking forward to getting a copy of your book as I'm just sooo tired of having to wade through all the rhetorical detritus, can hopefully get a good clean swing at cracking this spiritual walnut.

<br>
# On a practical level(If you can give me a little advice), I've gotten to the point (as I've mentioned), I'm getting the flashing imagery, and on occasion that buzzy/vibration through the body, that's as far as I seem to be able to go, not because I'm feeling fear or anything like that, it's more a case of not knowing of what to expect next, or what I should be doing now?( If anything?) It kinda feels I'm saying to myself..."Errr.. what next?"
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
