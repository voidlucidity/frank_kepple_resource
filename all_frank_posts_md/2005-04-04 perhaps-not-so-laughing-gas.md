I have a friend who's a dentist, that has been into the metaphysical long before me, and he says that the state laughing gas puts you in is the perfect state to project from.  If you can stay awake and "fall through the table" then you can stay out while your getting a filling, or anything else lol.  I thought this was kind of funny, and I wanted to know if anyone else had tried or experience this?

I myself don't have any experience about laughing gas in relation with astral projection myself but, I found about it something on the web :
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 People who have had nitrous oxide (laughing gas) at the dentist report spontaneous out of body experiences. In fact I know of a dental assistant who specifically uses nitrous oxide on herself to induce OBE's (I do not recommend this!) Why does this work? Because nitrous oxide produces a partial loss of the awareness of your surroundings and causes deep relaxation. The only spontaneous projection that my husband ever had was while he was on nitrous oxide at the dentist (and thought he had died because he was bobbing on the ceiling and could see his body perfectly.)

I didn't post the source from where i took it from because I don't know if i can post URLs from other sites here in the forum or not, but I will read the rules of usage soon

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Nitrous Oxide is an explosive, highly noxious substance, so I'm hoping that the original poster is not suggesting for other members to actually frivolously play around trying to ingest this gas?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
<br>
<br>
PS:
<br>
<br>
Just a short exerpt of the facts of this material:
<br>
<br>
SECTION IV--
<br>
FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD
<br>
DATA FLASH POINT (METHOD USED) N/A
<br>
FLAMMABLE LIMITS LEL UEL
<br>
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: none Copious quantities of water for fires with nitrous oxide as the oxidizer.
<br>
<br>
SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES: If possible, stop the flow of nitrous oxide which is supporting the fire.  If cylinders are involved in a fire, safely relocate or keep cool with water spray.
<br>
<br>
UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS: Nitrous oxide has been known to decompose exothermically to oxygen and nitrogen at elevated temperatures. This decomposition has also been shown to have explosive force (also see Reactivity Data).
<br>
<br>
SECTION V--
<br>
HEALTH HAZARD DATA
<br>
EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: Inhalation: High concentrations of nitrous oxide so as to exclude an adequate supply of oxygen to the lungs causes dizziness, deeper breathing due to air hunger, possible nausea and eventual unconsciousness. It is also employed as an anesthetic when mixed with oxygen. These mixtures are generally 80 molar % N2O and 20 molar % O2. Persons in ill health where such illness would be aggravated by exposure to nitrous oxide should not be allowed to work with or handle this product.
<br>
<br>
EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: If Inhaled: Conscious persons should be assisted to an    uncontaminated area and inhale fresh air. Quick removal from the contaminated area is most    important. Unconscious persons should be moved to an uncontaminated area, given assisted respiration with supplemental oxygen. Further treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Rescue personnel should be equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus and be cognizant of fire and explosion hazards.

Oh isn't that a coincidence! I posted about that yesterday! I had an OBE when I was 8 and having some teeth pulled out under Nitrous Oxide. I wasn't sure if it was a really vivid dream. But I saw something on the discovery channel that said that you don't dream when you have a general anaesthetic – I am not sure if they meant only a proper full anaesthetic?
<br>
<br>
Anyway it was a pretty cool experience! I was swinging on the pipes above my head (like any decent 8 year old would do) and then swung back into my body which had been moved into another room. But I defiantly wouldn't recommend anybody getting hold of some to induce an OBE, nasty stuff! Blugh!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You would have received very controlled quantities of NO2 and O under strict clinical conditions. Which is somewhat different to recommending that others grab a hold a of whatever NO2 they can get their hands on in order to project.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hmmm, Hippy Crack!  All that time waisted on selling and I could of been using it to heighten my astral experiences.   Honestly, I don't think it would of worked for Trust me, I am 37 years old and have flying around me. Anytime I ever inhaled the stuff it left me feeling sedated and very mentally lethargic.  But, what works for one person may not work for another. If your seeking a chemical enhancer then LSD or Mescaline would probably work better. I, however feel that no drug is the best one! Keeping our minds and bodies clean and clear will give us better experiences in the long run. Trust me! I am 37 years old and have been flying around astral planes for 21 years now. I have experimented with many chemicals/drugs. They do nothing but give you a false sense of euphoria. One that doesn't last. Your mind is a powerful tool. Clouding it with chemicals will only weaken it. I'm not preaching to you, I'm only advising you how to have a more full filling OBE experience.

Let me refrase, for frank here, and anyone else that might have misunderstood.  I am not "Recommending" this to anyone.  I was just asking based on what people have told me, and yes, more for those dentist trips that some times we all are forced to make.
<br>
<br>
Again, this is not to try on your own at home or something, I was specifically talking about the doctor or dentist's office.

I love that damn stuff. I wish I had a bottle of it by my bedside just so I could actually relax for once in my life.

Is it possible to ask doctor for NO2 instead of local anastesia?

i guess itll cost mor/ wont be allowed

You really don't want that stuff. It smells horrible and you're breathing it out for weeks after, so you can taste it... And that poor little girl died of heart failure in her dentist's surgery because of it.

Ammonium Nitrate--&gt;(slow heating)--&gt;N2O+H2O

<br>
It smells sweet by the way. Dont smell too much of it because you may fall down after the laughing part is over.
<br>
Dont make too much of it, because its a green house effect gas.
<br>
<br>
It actually supports the claims that oobes are produced whenever brain cuts off external sensory-motor stimulii.

Interesting stuff. I have to go get a root canal soon - do they give you anything besides the stuff that numbs your mouth? Or do you have to be awake the whole time? Anyone know? Id like to kill two birds with one stone..

I wrote in the past about an experience I had as a child while at the dentist with notrous oxide.  After it was administered I was counting backwards from 100.  I got to 94 and I started hearing a sound like WA Wa WA Wa as I started to spin and then saw the dentist from my sleeping position begin to extract some molars at which point I became full unconscious.  If I am ever put to sleep with this again I will definitely ask the doctor  to place a card so as I can try to view it as I think this is the perfect situation for an OBE to the RTZ.  It would put one into the RTZ as quick as a NDE.
