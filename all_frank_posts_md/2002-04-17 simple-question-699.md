<section>
Okay,  I have been unable to project.  I have been trying for rather a long time.   A year or so.   Now I do have one question since I am still new to many of the concepts of the action.  Originally I would just mediate on projecting.  And I usually meditate before I go to sleep.
<br>
<br>
Now my question.  In most of the things that I have read many people some what warn of not trying to project before you go to sleep when you are first starting out.
<br>
Why is that?
<br>
I know one of the things Mr. Bruce says, (I think if I remember correctly)  was that it is better when begining to try during the day when you are fully awake.  Mostly because it is daylight outside.
<br>
So are there any other reasons?
<br>
If not would this apply to me since I sleep during the day and am awake at night.  So if I was to try and go outside during the day I would have to do it before I sleep.
<br>
<br>
Also, I have gotten to the point of vibrations only a couple of times.  The last was several months ago and I have not been able to bring it back.  Any suggestions?
<br>

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I think why Robert Bruce suggested to try during the day was an advice for the scared ones. If I remember well, he was talking about sunlight, saying that if by accident there is an entity in the building or in your house, it would be easy for you to just go outside. That negative entities are rarely found in the full sunlight.
<br>
<br>
I hope it helps you.

Believe me when I say that you should not take what you read in books *too* literally. You should use the basic principles and develop your own way.
<br>
<br>
For example, just recently I have made *major* developments in my projection abilities. Despite having had hundreds of Astral experiences, I never knew what "chakras" were. People on this BBS were kind enough to point me in the direction of some basic information that I found *very* helpful.
<br>
<br>
Now, to me, a "chakra" sounds like some kind of potatoe crisp. But from the information I received, I managed to realise the importance of understanding the basic principles involved and the basic workings. From which, I developed a new set of terms that, as an ex-engineer, I can positively relate to.
<br>
<br>
Now, if someone were to ask me what I am doing, I'd reply, "I'm connecting my sense of conscious awareness to my Remote-Projection Interface".
<br>
<br>
You see, when someone talks to me about a "crown chakra" it means nothing. I instantly imagine it's something the Queen would wear on an off-day.
<br>
<br>
But thinking about a "remote-projection interface" says
<u>
 everything
</u>
to me. Because I can relate to it. Plus, it feels doubly exciting just knowing that I've got one... to the extent that, tomorrow morning, I cannot wait to activate it again.
<br>
<br>
The problem being, I feel, that years ago, in whatever land or language that term evolved in, the term: "chakra" probably gave those people
<u>
 exactly the same
</u>
sense of excitement that I feel today when I think of activating my "remote-projection interface".
<br>
<br>
Not only that, I discovered that I have a "remote visual interface" too. That I am finding I can activate SO easily. But when people would talk of "brow chakra" all I'd imagine was some potatoe crisp stuck in my hair.
<br>
<br>
So please realise that it can be *very* beneficial to work all the basics out in your own terms.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

The only thing that I can offer, is that I know exactly how it feels to be up against a brick wall on this, because when I first started, it took me a couple of months before I had my first OBE, and I was trying frequently.
<br>
<br>
The only thing that I can offer, is to keep at it, and don't worry about the night sleeping thing, just go for it all of the time, every day. Also, start telling your self to remember your dreams and that you will realize when you are dreaming. Reality checks may help. Constant reality checks that carry on into your subconcious, so even when you are sleeping, you will ask yourself the question and become lucid.
<br>
<br>
Keep at it, keep your mind clear, keep the affirmations going, as that is important as well. Keep your mind saturated with the subject, and be persistent. Then, when you least expect it, it will happen.....
<br>
<br>
Hope to help,

There are a few reasons to try and project in the day, besides being useful if projecting in the dark is frightening. Some people are more likely to fall asleep when they try right before bed. Also, in the morning, are minds are more active, while our body is still in a relaxed state. Also, practicing in the day when you're less sleepy, you're starting more from scratch, and maybe it gives you more "robust" skills. None of these are hard and fast rules. I've only managed one projection, and it was waking up from a nap during the day, but I've *very* close right before bed. I don't think *anything* is a "rule."
<br>
<br>
For me, energy has been everything. When I get close, it's always after my crown center activates. And if I'm not buzzing a bit before I lie down, there's much less of a chance I'll close. My suggestion is to use the NEW system obsessively, as well as cultivating a focused mind, learning how to relax your body, and that's about it. At least for me, the energy really does take over and stuff starts to happen spontaneously. When it's happened once, then I can work on getting it back consciously during successive attempts. Don't be afraid to experiment. Everything that's worked for me has always been a little different from what I've read. I used to just lie down and start pushing and pulling with my mind, not moving for an hour.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck!

<section>
I was asking because I do sleep during the day.  I usually go to bed about 10 or 11 AM.  I work the night shift.
<br>
<br>
Thanks or all the input.

Just keep at it!  Try experimenting, if that helps...?  You'll get there eventually, and I find that projecting in the morning works best...
