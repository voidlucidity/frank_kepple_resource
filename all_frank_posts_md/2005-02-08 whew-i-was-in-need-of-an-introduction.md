This place is overwhelming. I could use some Astral buddies.
<br>
<br>
I've been experimenting with projecting using NEW. I'm not sure whether my results are even close to training my body - but I keep trying anyway. Practice has to help somewhat.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy,

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forums. Perhaps best if you keep your projection practice to nightime hours. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
