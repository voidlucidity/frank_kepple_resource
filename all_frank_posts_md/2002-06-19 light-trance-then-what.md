ok, i  can enter a light trance fairly easily now, but  how do i go from that to an OBE, i assume you do an exit tecnique, so i did, i used the rope but could only maintain the sensation vividly for a split-second,  it takes a helluva lot of concentration even for this, also i can still feel my body, should an exit tecnique only be attempted when your body is totally numb?
<br>
<br>
and, from a light trance, how would i go about entering a deeper trance?

I can help ya with the second part. First tool that is
<b>
 very
</b>
handy is the induction of a falling sensation. If you mentally induce the feeling of falling, like when you feel your stomach do weird things (recreate the feeling from memory, like on a plane/elevator/roller coaster). This will raise energy and deepen your trance very rapidly. This is best done in short spurts, like one second long with a couple seconds in between. Be prepared for the vertigo. Also, I found I needed a careful balance, as if I induce this sensation to hard, my muscles want to convulse, which is detrimental to the trance state. So, just enough to induce the sensation, and no further.
<br>
<br>
The second tool for getting into a deeper trance is the mental falling technique, which I percieve a little differently. RB suggests using some kind of mantra, like 'down...down...down...' or 'falling...falling...falling...' and at the same time picture a downwards action, like climbing down a ladder, or in an elevator with the wall in front of you sliding upwards in a blur as you descend. These are all just aids to trick your mind. One thing I've been experimenting with recently is believing I'm slowly losing consciousness, and imagining a scenario where I'm being put under anesthesia and being told to count down from ten...'ten...nine(getting softer)...eight(and so on)...'. Find what works for you and stick with it, and just keep repeating to achieve the desired level.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps! Deep trances are fantastic for so many reasons.

That's the zillion-dollar question. And because there is not one clear method that works, there are hundreds of them that all claim to be able to induce all manner of bodily sensations.
<br>
<br>
If you can afford it, I would seriously consider trying the Gateway Wave 1 CD (to Focus 10). It is sure to save you a *lot* of time in experimentation.
<br>
<br>
For example, it took me around 3-years to realise that relaxing from the head downwards was a whole load more effective than relaxing from the feet up. The CD has it all on there already, for you to learn in just a few weeks.
<br>

hey BITSMART.....
<br>
do i need to be in a light trance and have activated my chakras before inducing the falling sensation??
<br>
and if i imagine myself going down a ladder, should i visualise it, or FEEL it,  feeling myself climb down a ladder is very hard if im lying in bed.
<br>
<br>
Why are deep trances fantastic?

I'm going to try the falling sensation - thanks, bitsmart.
<br>
<br>
My problem is generally that the deeper I go, the harder it is to stay alert. One thing that helps me, is to mentally articulate that my mind and my body are divorced from each other. For some reason, forcing the idea of separateness of mind and body helps me allow one to do one thing, and the other to do another thing. Wording is important to me in these explorations. "Allowing perception' works; 'seeing' doesn't.  "Divorcing' mind from body works, ' separating' the two doesn't.
<br>
<br>
The rope technique has a fantastic pull for me - but I never go anywhere with it. I just get worn out. THe other night I tried the rope from my head - and was surprised to have the same tug atmy head that I normally have at my chest.
<br>
<br>
Still,. I got worn out and gave up. What should the goal be? SHould one expect that five minutes of active rope tugging would do the trick? Or is more like an hour necessary?
<br>

rodent: It's more about feeling like your moving downward in some way, whether climbing, falling, sinking...and it should be a feeling more than a visualization. Visualizing may just help trick your mind, it's not the main focus. Don't worry about which level of trance you're in, or your chakras (unless you're doing NEW work.) Just try to go DEEP. And a deep trance is fantastic, but it's hard to put into words why...you just need to see for yourself.
