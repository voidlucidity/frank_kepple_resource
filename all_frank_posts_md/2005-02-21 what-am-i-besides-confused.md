I'm not sure if anyone here can help w/this or if you all have your specific areas that you know.   I guess I'm looking for someone w/a general knowledge of all areas of psychic development to help me determine how and if I can control what I "have".   (Sorry I'm unsure on a lot of the terminology)  My friend Loveregardless said she learned a lot here and I was hoping for some guidance myself.  I guess the easiest thing to do would list all the things that are "different" about me.
<br>
<br>
I see, smell, and feel ghosts (or some type of spirit)  Never heard any though
<br>
<br>
I have many "hunches" that come true and I've had 1 fully realized true dream.
<br>
<br>
I can usually read Tarot Cards (some people I REALLY don't feel like reading for so I don't try if I have a bad feeling)
<br>
<br>
Lotsa deja vu
<br>
<br>
I have an insane level of empathy-  friends, strangers, animals, my "ghosts",  all the same-  I have a high intuition for others feelings and I literally FEEL their emotions.  It can be exhausting
<br>
<br>
I may be a psychic vampire by accident-  I rarely sleep but exhaust others around me....  OK that one's kinda hard to word but I hope someone knows what I mean.
<br>

I know that's quite the laundry list-  I hope someone knows what my deal is.  I've always been this way .... well as much as I can remember of the past 25yrs-  which is a lot surprisingly LOL

Whoa, don't suck my energy lol.
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forums.
<br>
<br>
I don't think it is possible to be an empath and a pychic vampire, but who knows?

<section>
thank you for the tips Nick
<br>
<br>
RT I'm not certain I'm either-  that's what I'm here to find out-  maybe I try to "take" negativity from peeps as part of the empathy link or maybe I feel the pain of others b/c I'm taking their energy
<br>
<br>
Who knows?  Guess I'll keep researching

<br>
Welcome to the forum, hope you like it here!
<br>
<br>
If you present your questions in the main forum under the appropriate topic-heading then you are sure to get lots of responses. If it helps, I've had the feeling of deja vu before.
