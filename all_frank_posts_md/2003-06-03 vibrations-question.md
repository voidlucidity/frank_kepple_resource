I did check the archives, I just couldn't get a definitive answer..
<br>
<br>
So: Do the vibrations feel like you're actually shaking/jolting/etc, or are they more like a tingle of energy/nice pins &amp; needles/whatever kind of feeling?
<br>
<br>
I get both, and people seem to talk about both, I'm just not sure which I should be concentrating on

It is generally accepted that the vibrations are a
<u>
 symptom
</u>
of projection. As such, they are not an end in themselves. I think it was Tisha who once said they can feel like sitting on a very unbalanced spin-dryer revolving at top speed. Then again, at the other end of the scale, people have perceived them as a mild kind of buzzing sensation.
