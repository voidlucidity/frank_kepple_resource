<section>
People have been Emailing me and asking about the differences between illusions caused by your own fears, and the Astral proper; how can you tell the difference, and what's the best way of controlling your emotions, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
I apologise for not being able to spare the time to answer each question on an individual basis. So I thought I'd post you one of my own experiences which demonstrates how Astral events and/or circumstances can change from one moment to the next. Plus, it shows you how easy it is for situations to get out of hand. Notes about the various changes I put in [square brackets].
<br>
<br>
Okay, here goes.........
<br>
<br>
I was standing in an open space alongside a guide, seeking understanding about the nature of human emotions and their interaction with the Astral. We were chatting generally about thoughts and emotions and about the different types of characters that people have. I asked my guide if it would be alright for me to "see" an emotion. He said okay which one do you want? I said "greed".
<br>
<br>
The scenary changed and we came into a ballroom. [Still in Astral proper.] There were a large number of people enjoying what looked like a "mafia style" party. At one end of the room was a stage and on it was being played a gloriously entertaining show the like of which I could never begin to imagine. There were the most beautiful creatures performing a wonderous dance. It was a truly fantastic interplay between form and colour. Words could not even begin to describe the phenomenal display of beauty. Save to say the scene was utterly captivating and I was absolutely enthralled.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly I realised my guide was trying to distract my attention from the show. Eagerly I began asking questions about it but he directed my attention elswhere. We walked through the crowd of people to one side of the room. It was then I noticed all down one wall of this room was a line of cash dispensers. A large group of people were bustling and jostling around each one. They appeared to be competing between themselves to make a withdrawal. All around people were holding large wads of cash. Banknotes were stacked in piles and many just littered the floor.
<br>
<br>
My guide took me close to a machine. Well, as close as we could manage that is. I was peering over people's shoulders trying to see the dispenser screen. Then, when I got near enough to see, I realised something: each time they made a withdrawal, their account would be credited by the amount of the withdrawal, not debited as is normal. Each withdrawal made them every more greedy to make another withdrawal, and ever more greedy to make another... and another... and another... and so on.
<br>
<br>
We retreated a little and, through the crowd, I could just make out the show was continuing. Yet the only thing the majority of people in the crowded room was interested in doing was grappling to try and take money from the machines.
<br>
<br>
My guide explained that the performance was a celebration of the relationship between light, colour and form; and that the work symbolised the formation of a life-sustaining planet, such as Earth. He further explained that there were quite a number of touring "shows" that travelled regions of the Astral in a similar way to those on Earth
<br>
<br>
But hardly anyone in the room gave a damm about that. All they were concerned about was greedily taking and hoarding as much money as possible. The contrast was sickening to the extent where I asked my guide if we could please go. My guide became a little surprised and asked me if I'd like to make some withdrawals. No, I said, thank you but I'd just like to leave.
<br>
<br>
He said there was only one way out of the room which was through a door that opened into a corridor. Along that corridor were a line of doors and that I could go through any one of them... as each room had an exit I could use. He led me to the door and beckoned me to leave. I asked if he would accompany me. But no, he insisted this was the point at which we should part company.
<br>
<br>
So I thanked my guide and bid him farewell.
<br>
<br>
[Maintain air of natural curiosity.] On entering the corridor was a line of doors. There was a door immediately opposite me so, as my guide had said it didn't matter which door, I simply chose that one. The room was of a totally different character than the one I just left. It had a soft deep-pile carpet and what appeared to be velvet-lined walls. Beautifully woven tapestries were hanging all around. There wasn't a door that I could see, so I parted what looked like a shimmering silk curtain in front of me.
<br>
<br>
To my left was a large wooden door that had been delicately carved out of what looked like fine mahogany. Great, I thought, there was the exit. However, immediately in front of me was an enormous bed that looked like something you'd imagine a famous movie-star would sleep in. Lying on this bed, in a very seductive pose, was an incredibly gorgeous woman.
<br>
<br>
It suddenly occured to me that the same (or very similar) setup was probably in each of the rooms along that corridor. I deduced that once the people in the room had satisfied their lust for money, next they satisfied their sexual lust to the same obnoxious extent.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, who cares, I thought and went to open the door. But it would not open. There was no obvious handle, so I tried mentally pushing and pulling but still it wouldn't budge.
<br>
<br>
The woman smiled, arose from the bed, and approached me questioning why I wanted to leave. The sexual undertones were very obvious to the extent where I doubted, just for an instant, my ability to control the situation. Then... aaagh... at which point she wrapped her arms around me. [Enter buffer-zone experience and feel justification for my doubting to control.] Closing my eyes I thought might help but she began caressing my upper body whilst trying to coax me onto the bed. All the while I am giving myself a running commentary on what is going on.
<br>
<br>
Note: I have found doing this has a calming effect on the mind and helps me stay in control of my thoughts during "scary moments".
<br>
<br>
[Buffer-zone experience depletes due to having dissipated the emotional energy.] I regained my composure while the energy was dissipating and, sure enough, on opening my eyes there she was back on the bed. But darn it, the moment I saw her a flash of mild annoyance slipped through my mind, thinking like, "How dare she do that!" [Enter buffer-zone experience and feel justification for mild annoyance.] Aaagh... just when things were getting under control.
<br>
<br>
I further braced myself for the effects. But knowing that if I just remained calm, the energy would dissipate. Immediately her face began snarling at me. Problem was, she went from being ever so stunningly beautiful, to being ever so ugly, in the briefest of moments; the contrast caught me off guard to the extent where I really lost it. For just a tiny split-second I thought, "Oh no I'm trapped!" [Worsening buffer-zone experience, matching worsening of emotional control. Now feel justification for feelings of being trapped.]
<br>
<br>
But no, phew, reflexes had kicked in and I was back in the physical lying on my bed.
<br>
<br>
I lay there for a few minutes thinking about what happened, feeling very cheesed off with myself for not keeping my composure. I had really wanted to see what was on the other side of the door. Oh well, you can't win them all, I thought, and got up to make some notes.
<br>
<br>
Whoops, there's something not right here. Er, Frank, this doesn't feel right at all. Wait a minute, no, it can't be. Oh heck, I'm not in the physical at all. Next moment, the woman drew back a curtain. I desperately tried to contain my shock at seeing her. I got out of "my" bed realising that I was still in the same room on the Astral. Yet, I swear a moment later I would have staked my life on the fact that I was in the physical and lying in my own bed.
<br>
<br>
For some reason, rather than panic, I just simply let out a laugh while thinking of how surreal the whole experience was. How stupid of me to have let out the emotion of feeling "trapped" and how that energy fooled me SO darned completely. Making me think that I was truly back in the physical when it had all been an illusion.
<br>
<br>
Yet it felt so real. My bedside table and lamp; my wife beside me; the atmosphere of the room, it all "matched" perfectly. Even down to the sliver of light coming into the room from the night-light on the upstairs landing. I thought of how tuly wonderous and magical the Astral is. Yet, at the same time, how tricky it can be to get around all the potential pitfalls. [Exit buffer-zone experience. Emotional control now fully regained.]
<br>
<br>
I'd given up hope of trying to open the door so, ignoring my surroundings, I simply closed my eyes and walked through it. As I did so a swirl of colour came into my mind and next instant I'm lying on my bed in the physical.
<br>
<br>
There's this little voice in my head saying, "Er, havn't we done this once before, Frank?" So I get out of bed, and all the while expecting to hear that woman go, "Ta da!" And her face appears from behind a curtain.
<br>
<br>
So I'm heading downstairs, but still not believing it. In fact, it took about 10 minutes before I truly believed I was back!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Wow! This is amazing! I can see how tricky it can be!

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I think my personal best is 7-10 successive
<br>
instances of "false awakenings", each time being
<br>
harder to judge whether I was awake or not. I
<br>
believe I wrote the entire event (and the OBE
<br>
which it followed) about three times, each time
<br>
realising afterwards I was still in the astral
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, great post Frank. I think the truth about
<br>
objectivity is that one must be a master in
<br>
mind-control to truly mask the so-called reality
<br>
fluctuations, and even then it may not be 100%. As
<br>
an example, Franz Bardon's Initiation into
<br>
Hermetics places astral projection (although it's
<br>
more advanced than plain vanilla OBEs) at Step 9
<br>
of 10 (of which can take 30 years or more to get
<br>
that far in development). He stresses several
<br>
times the importance of projecting, verifying the
<br>
accuracy of the immediate environment, and going
<br>
back, rinse and repeat no matter how long it
<br>
takes, until you're confident it's accurate. So
<br>
naturally if a person of such an advanced level of
<br>
mind-control needs such practice, I don't think
<br>
anyone should feel depressed over the lack of
<br>
accuracy of their experiences.
<br>
<br>
Regards
<br>
Conn

First ,as a new member to this group, I would like to say that I am soooo happy that I am not the only person in the world with this gift! Â It may sound ridiculous, but until a couple months ago I was never on line. So, Here I am. TY! Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Just like in the physical plane, we use our cognitive thinking to cope with certain situations. But, in the AP, only the slightest change of our thinking can change the course of the whole experience in its self. Â The one thing that I have learned is, that to think like I am in the physical is impossible! Somehow our thoughts generate a manifested energy from deep inside ourselves. We create own own outcomes by our spiritual thoughts. As I tell all, the mind is a powerful tool. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  False awakenings are unique. Somehow we or our spirits are not finished or ready to awake, but the experience we were in has been full filled. So, we are projected back to our bodies only to soon learn that we really aren't back in the physical. This causes the start of yet another new and exciting astral experience. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  I can't remember how many times I have thought I am really awake only to find that I have been deceived by myself. I have gotten up, peed. washed my face, brushed my teeth, then noticed a door or window in my living room that was never there before. Hello, your really not awake! Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â My outlook on the whole subject tends to be a bit more spiritual than the average person. In some way I believe GOD is preparing me for some thing else. Not everyone thinks that way, but not everyone has had the same OBE's Â that I have. On the other hand Â I do not pass any judgment on those who think differently than I. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Thank You for sharing your in site! I hope we converse again.

Simplification Warning : It's probably impossible to explain exactly, but it's the area you are in when you dream.
