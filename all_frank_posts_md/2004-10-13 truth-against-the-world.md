Hi all,
<br>
This topic may upset some people, so if you think it may and don't want to go through that please don't read any further.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Ever since I was a small boy I have known a little secret that it seemed the majority of people I met or saw had no idea about.
<br>
<br>
Back then in the early 60's I was a kid, and Aware of the huge and growing gap between the world of Man and the reality of Spirit. At the time it was too big to bridge for just a small kid.
<br>
<br>
Now as a 44 year old (geez, I got 'old' quick) I see that the gap has grown even more and very few can or even want to bridge the void.
<br>
<br>
So I looked at the reasons behind that. What I found disturbed me a gr8 deal, and because it is so prevalent still I get a bit frustrated with it.
<br>
<br>
What was it I found ? Truth.
<br>
<br>
Why is that disturbing to me ? The world we live in does not run on Truth.
<br>
<br>
Why is that so ? Because we are choosing to stay stuck in out-of-date realities, ideologies and belief system structures that work less and less for us as the years roll by.
<br>
<br>
Why is this frustrating to me ? Because it is !! LOL
<br>
<br>
We are heading into a new cycle as this old cycle slowly reaches it's climactic end, yet most people still cling desperately to the outdated modes and beliefs-systems. These modes have no relevance to where we as a race are heading.. they are passing their use by date.
<br>
<br>
But this is nothing new. The ancient Druids knew this way back in the BC years ! The thread title is one of their Maxims, and it is still relevant today !!! Surprisingly it is one of the few concepts that are, and it is one that will come forward with us into the new cycle.
<br>
<br>
The problem is this. For so long now we humans have allowed those in power to tell us what Truth is and this has developed into a situation where people will not let go of their beliefs so they can move forward and experience the new dynamics that are available to us now.
<br>
<br>
Why I find this so frustrating is this. Very few will actually listen to anything beyond their own belief structure.. the one they chose to attach to. Which seems strange in the times we are in because those old systems have proven themselves to confine and define us as something much less than what we really are.
<br>
<br>
It is responsible for what I call the "little soul syndrome". This is where the majority of people still believe that they are insignificant little souls here on a life that must have suffering, Karmic debts, good and evil, etc,etc,etc. It just goes on and on !
<br>
<br>
Even the New Age Industry does very little to help people move out of that belief into Clarity. In fact, the new age industry is really more of the same old same old. In my experience the new-agers are much more interested in making themselves mega-bucks to provide feel-good experiences that do nothing to REALLY open you to the higher awareness we have as Souls.
<br>
<br>
So in reality it isn't helping anyone out of the old dynamics as it is really still working in the old dynamics Itself. It is just following the same old human pattern of endeavors.
<br>
<br>
What I foresee is events in this world that will absolutely blow most peoples concepts of reality out of the water completely. They will be so effected by this that Clarity workers will have one go at helping them to see clearly.. one go only because the numbers who need to reach clarity will be in the millions.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, when I speak with people about this they immediately go into Defensive or Offensive mode !!!!!!!!! Why ? Because the foundations of their entire life are being questioned and shown to be the limiting belief system structures that they really are.
<br>
<br>
So... seek Limitless, find Clarity in your own Soul experience, search out Self-Empowering ways instead of the Dis-empowering ways we have been working with for so many thousands of years.
<br>
<br>
The time has come for us all to reach beyond the limitations imposed and indoctrinated into us by those who have held the reins of power for all those millenia.
<br>
<br>
"Truth Against the World", because the world is in Untruth, the Truth is perceived as being Against the way of the World. And it really is !
<br>
<br>
Time for each of us to choose whether we stay in this modality or move forward into the new dawn before us.
<br>
<br>
 Love Always.

Hi Rastus,
<br>
Good to see you here.  Thanks for your input and support.
<br>
<br>
And I am so impressed by your growth this year.. absolutely excellent.  Isn't it amazing that the smallest thing can set off such an immense realization ?
<br>
<br>
Yes, it was always there !  For a lot of people who meet and or work with their Guides never actually make the simplest connection to the fact that their Primary guide is really themself... their Higher-Self.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing your realization here.
<br>
<br>
Love Always.

<section>
Tayesen,
<br>
<br>
I agree with much of your wise words, my friend.  The only thing I might focus more on might be our ability to laugh at the ridiculousness of our actions at times as we see how we always tend to overreact to things.  Someone once said, "Laughter is the best medicine"...and I like to follow this directive much of the time.  How many times has laughter or humor gotten us out of a tight spot?  I think that if the whole world would just break out in uncontrollable laughter a major healing would definitely take place.

<section>
thank ya kindly sirs.
<br>
all very beautifully and well put.
<br>
<br>
the logical rational wanting to know things portion of my brain would like to hear you elaborate on the things that you feel will happen and why exactly we will only have one chance to help people when events begin to cummilate into something noticeable by everyone.
<br>
<br>
It's funny, I was just thinking last night about how we as societies and civilizations set up these systems to live by that are always based upon a restructuring of sytems we did not completely like in the past, yet we are unwilling to give them up or change them when it becomes obvious that our "better" sytem does not work...

<section>
the truth is always relative, absolute truth is the priviledge of god (again, not christian god)
<br>
the earth is reclaiming what is rightfully hers, and what was lost a long time ago
<br>
current truth you know has only one goal - aid you in your development
<br>
make all you can out of it and abandon it when better oportunity (bigger picture) arrives

(again, not christian god) - what, there are more gods? you may wanna say not how christians understand god, that's diffrent. everyting happens for a reason or maybe for fun, let's all laugh. I think at all this must put an end, ALL OF US.
<br>
<br>
i see that your a Godsmack fan so here you go (for Tayesin)
<br>
<br>
Artist: Godsmack
<br>
Album: Faceless
<br>
Song: Serenity
<br>
<br>
Lyrics:
<br>
<br>
As I sit here and slowly close my eyes
<br>
I take another deep breath
<br>
And feel the wind pass through my body
<br>
I'm the one in your soul
<br>
Reflecting the light
<br>
Protect the ones who hold you
<br>
Cradling your inner child
<br>
<br>
It's serenity
<br>
In a place where I can hide
<br>
I need serenity
<br>
Nothing changes, days go by
<br>
<br>
Where do we go when we just don't know
<br>
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
<br>
Why do we dream when I thought mean nothing
<br>
And when will we learn to control
<br>
<br>
Tragic visions slowly stole my life
<br>
Tore away everything
<br>
Cheating me out of my time
<br>
I'm the one who loves you
<br>
No matter wrong or right
<br>
And every day I hold you
<br>
I hold you with my inner child
<br>
<br>
It's serenity
<br>
In a place where I can hide
<br>
I need serenity
<br>
Nothing changes, days go by
<br>
<br>
Where do we go when we just don't know
<br>
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold
<br>
Why do we dream when I thought mean nothing
<br>
And when will we learn to control
<br>
<br>
AND ANOTHER THAT I LIKE A LOT
<br>
<br>
"Trippin'"
<br>
<br>
Living a different way. You can't expect me to be the same.
<br>
Separating our lives and wondering why.
<br>
Face down I walk away. Every time I think I do the right thing,
<br>
you turn your back on me.
<br>
<br>
Trippin' into a world that never seems too far away.
<br>
Too much time, too many wasted days.
<br>
<br>
How can you be this way? Now I'm alone and cold today.
<br>
I'm walking dead man's drive. Reaching out for my life.
<br>
I've been known to f**k up everything.
<br>
In this skin there's a broken man.
<br>
<br>
Trippin' into a world that never seems too far away.
<br>
Too much time, too many wasted days.
<br>
Just another vision in my world!
<br>
.......................................................................................
<br>
<br>
<br>
WE WELL WALK THE PATH EVEN IF WE DON'T WANT

now, if you don't know ask within you why you are crying, this just shows your current state, now, if you do investigate it may be suspected of changing you a bit

all truth are parts of the whole, the may resonate with each other or not (wars etc), but there is no absolute truth unless you are ALL THAT IS (and that includes all that have been and will be, or may be , or haven't been, or won't be, you get the picture)

I sucked the hell out from one of my teachers (that man has tones of energy) and after i felt so calm, then started to give him mental energy from 3rd eye to 3rd eye and after 1-2 minutes, he started to give me his one, tones of it, for half an hour or more. But i'm no sure if i was takeing that or he gave that to me.

<section>
Hello Tayesin,
<br>
<br>
Please allow me the chance to shed some light as to why you encounter so much resistance when you talk about your beliefs and idéas, and the Paradox I find in your post
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
In another post there are an ongoing discussion about Why or Why Not established religions.
<br>
<br>
That made me think more consciously about the guidelines inside me, that keep me from joining an established religion, and one of them were "If it promotes fronts, like "Us against Them", or "WE are right, and THEY are wrong", then I'm out of there faster than lightning.
<br>
<br>
I find, that the title of your tread gives one of the answers as to why you experience so much resistance, when promoting your idéas and beliefs:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Truth Against the World
</b>
<br>
<br>
Hmmm - I for one LOVES playing the Devils advocate. It gives me a chance to "test" my self, and the statements I come up against. I would think, that I am not the only one "enjoying" that little game
<img alt=":twisted:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/evil.png" title="evil"/>
<br>
<br>
If we (just for the Learning-proces of it) were to play a little Thought-game here, then the scenario could be:
<br>
<br>
You have established a "religion" based on your beliefs (not uncommen when someone has found "the truth"), and I was thinking of joining up as a "member" of that religion.... Okay - so far so good
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
(And please remember, this is a thought-experiment, designed to show different viewpoints, and perhaps learn to learn a little better - NOT an attack on you or your beliefs
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
)
<br>
<br>
Okay - I sit down and listen to you, with an open heart and an active mind
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
....
<i>
 we humans have allowed those in power to tell us what Truth is
</i>
.... "Hmmm - So you tell me, that You hold the truth, that You are "right", so that makes you "a person in power". Why should I "join you" instead of the others - to me that is just replacing one Leader (or faith) with another ??" .... The endresult being that I'm not "stupid" in YOUR eyes anymore - but does that brings ME closer to MY "truth" ? ...
<br>
<br>
"Truth against the World" ... Ouch, when that hits me, it instantly gives the feeling, that If I am not with you, then I'm against you - and since you tell me, that you "hold" the Truth, then I must hold Falseness, then my entire belief-system must be false. I (Like you) doesn't like any one telling me, that I'm too stupid to see, that what I have chosen is totally and utter Falseness, and that Basically I am a fool for believing what I believe...
<br>
<br>
Okay - enough of this
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
..... This is mearely meant as a "pointer" to why you experience such resistance when promoting your idéas. And the above scenario is very familiar to me, as I have been there too. (Meaning I have tried to promote some of MY idéas and beliefs, and encountered the same resistance).
<br>
<br>
The main problem with this is (imho), that the idéas, thoughts and beliefs can be basically sound and fine, but the way they are brought to other peoples attention actually prevents them from finding their own truth in them (!) .... Meaning, you will not (If you believe in what you say), "push" your beliefs down the throat of the people that are listening to you (Because that would make YOU one of the BAD guys that you warn others about(!) ... ), but you want them to discover it by themselfs, and one of the ways you can do that is to ALLOW them to hold on to their beliefs, and PRESENT your beliefs as a way of EXPANDING their beliefs, but without ATTACKING their believe, in words, feelings or from the very mind-state you are talking from
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
(Personally I find, that the very concept of "The Truth" is like a Holy Grale .... Truth for me is in the eye of the beholder)...
<br>
<br>
But, then again - that is only MY beliefs
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

 But this is nothing new. The ancient Druids knew this way back in the BC years ! The thread title is one of their Maxims, and it is still relevant today !!! Surprisingly it is one of the few concepts that are, and it is one that will come forward with us into the new cycle.
 <br>
 <br>
 The problem is this. For so long now we humans have allowed those in power to tell us what Truth is and this has developed into a situation where people will not let go of their beliefs so they can move forward and experience the new dynamics that are available to us now.
 <br>
 <br>
 Why I find this so frustrating is this. Very few will actually listen to anything beyond their own belief structure.. the one they chose to attach to. Which seems strange in the times we are in because those old systems have proven themselves to confine and define us as something much less than what we really are.
 <br>
 <br>
 It is responsible for what I call the "little soul syndrome". This is where the majority of people still believe that they are insignificant little souls here on a life that must have suffering, Karmic debts, good and evil, etc,etc,etc. It just goes on and on !
 <br>
 <br>
 Even the New Age Industry does very little to help people move out of that belief into Clarity. In fact, the new age industry is really more of the same old same old. In my experience the new-agers are much more interested in making themselves mega-bucks to provide feel-good experiences that do nothing to REALLY open you to the higher awareness we have as Souls.
 <br>
 <br>
 So in reality it isn't helping anyone out of the old dynamics as it is really still working in the old dynamics Itself. It is just following the same old human pattern of endeavors.
 <br>
 <br>
 What I foresee is events in this world that will absolutely blow most peoples concepts of reality out of the water completely. They will be so effected by this that Clarity workers will have one go at helping them to see clearly.. one go only because the numbers who need to reach clarity will be in the millions.
 <br>
 <br>
 Interestingly, when I speak with people about this they immediately go into Defensive or Offensive mode !!!!!!!!! Why ? Because the foundations of their entire life are being questioned and shown to be the limiting belief system structures that they really are.
 <br>
 <br>
 So... seek Limitless, find Clarity in your own Soul experience, search out Self-Empowering ways instead of the Dis-empowering ways we have been working with for so many thousands of years.
 <br>
 <br>
 The time has come for us all to reach beyond the limitations imposed and indoctrinated into us by those who have held the reins of power for all those millenia.
 <br>
 <br>
 "Truth Against the World", because the world is in Untruth, the Truth is perceived as being Against the way of the World. And it really is !
 <br>
 <br>
 Time for each of us to choose whether we stay in this modality or move forward into the new dawn before us.
 <br>
 <br>
 Love Always.

ok, darkheaven, i give you a quick fix - ground, all the time, 24/7/365, don't let excrement accumulate in you, earth can take it and transform
<br>
<br>
addiction is pleasure seeking, unless you deal with pleasure seeking you will always be addicted
<br>
now, why do you seek pleasure, what is pleasure anyway ?
<br>
the pleasure is a thought that mind wants to reexperience, and when it cannot we have suffering
<br>
another type of suffering is non-acceptance of the world, you waste the energy resisting reality instead of using it to alter it
<br>
again pain is not equal to suffering, pain is physical and suffering mental
<br>
<br>
now, does it mean that you mustn't feel hapiness (warning, happiness is not pleasure), happiness is when the mind accepts the reality experience, doesn't judge it, thus experiencing it directly, and doesn't seek to reexperience it, thus deriving much more joy out of it (again, with no thoughts there is no fear of not experiencing it again, with acceptance no fear of experiencing it again (if it's painful))
<br>
result ==&gt; happiness
<br>
what do you need to achieve such state
<br>
stop seeking , open the windows, and tell your mind to shut up (but don't force it to stay shut, only observe it  and it will shut on his own accord), and don't shut your senses else how would you experience anything
<br>
then wait
<br>
may come, may not, but you can't do anything more (or less for that matter

i don't judge that much cause it tends to happen to me (but not this is the main reason) after and i find it many times amusing, i don't judge cause i know "if i was there maybe i would've done the same, it is a lesson that must be learned"
<br>
<br>
but i judge cause i don't like things, "diffrent" people, "diffrent" stuff.

Hi Kenneth,
<br>
Your's was an excellent post, and it reiterated for me one of the reminders I've been getting this year...  time to change my approach !!!
<br>
<br>
When I posted saying I found Truth, I did not find any belief system's version of truth.. so it is not like the assertion that it is only God who holds such.  What I found was this World does not run on Truth.  Dishonesty is the way of the majority... witness the belief in Little White Lies being perfectly okay to use, when it is Dis-Honest to accept such as reality.  But here we are in a world that refuses to accept it's responsibility for the choice to be not Honest.
<br>
<br>
When a person understands the Druid Maxim of Truth Against the World, it is done through an opening to a wider perception.  There is in reality a them and us perception in all things, Separation.  The Truths of standard Belief systems have only a small gem of real truth, and the rest is every imaginable kind of deceit for the purposes of Control.  Unfortunately it is a historical fact, and one that I would dearly love to change before I die.
<br>
<br>
So now we get to the aspect of Approach.  I've tried using the normally accepted avenues.. Spiritual Churches, Meetings, Meditation Groups and the list goes on and on.  What I discovered was this...  everything was fine and dandy as long as I went along with what was happening and DID NOT DISSENT or offer other possibilities to those already being offered !!!   Once I said one thing that went in an opposite direction (toward self-empowerment for all) to that pushed by the avenues I was ignored.. asked not to return even.  LOL, I get that !!
<br>
<br>
At one evening I was asked to organize in return for some Podium time, a lady needed help then and there yet the New-Agers insured that I could not speak to the lady without them interrupting and forcing their phone numbers into her hand and continually asking her questions about other things so that we could not stay on topic together.   Greed was the key there too.  And of course I could not respond and tell them to go away, as I would have been seen as the bad guy then !!!
<br>
<br>
What I discovered about this was rather simple.  Those running these avenues where actually building their own clientele numbers so that they had an increased income.  The people attending had never been shown how simple it is to Awaken to our higher awareness levels to get their own answers and directions.  And the people running the avenues were not about to let anyone else show them !  Why ?  Simple, to insure they kept their clientele and made more money.
<br>
<br>
Yet the people running the avenues had already paid megabucks to their teachers in order to attend sanctioned seminars and courses that never once included Self-empowerment as it's goal, nor taught them how to reach their Guides easily, etc,etc,etc.   So in effect, it was just more of the same thing humans have always done... make more money for themselves at the cost of other peoples freedom and options.
<br>
<br>
What I am against is the total and utter refusal to see that things have to change, that there are much simpler ways to grow spiritually, and that it is Free to those who seek it.   And, I am against the closing out of those of us who would make change happen.
<br>
<br>
So I found another avenue to try, it is completely practice based, free, and I can attend to share what I have without being censured for it.   The basis of this small group is to share whether it is massage, spiritual practices or healing, etc.  And amazingly, the people attending treated me like an Equal right from the start.  That was so refreshing I can tell you, and so much nicer than the Ego-driven responses of those who are already in Lifestyle Practices.
<br>
<br>
Would you believe one of those who block the way offered me a free Psychic reading that went along the lines of, "you aren't meant to share your knowledge, you are meant to work with disabled children instead",  or like one of my ex-friends readings said to me, "you are meant to detail cars for a living".  LOL   Talk about trying to insure there was no competition in their fields.  In fact, the last one even complained that we can't both be good at the same things and so i had to stop and just go about having a normal working life like all the other 'normal' people.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Kenneth, there really is an us and them thing in the world, always has been.  Whenever anyone comes along with something different or simpler, it usually gets excrement on to start with as not many people like change.. it's uncomfortable !
<br>
<br>
I am not looking to find followers.  I teach people how to explore for themselves, how to find their own Power and their own answers instead of relying on others to tell them the answers.  So I don't give answers to people.. I lead them to their own so they can go on their way and share it with others they meet.  Never charging for the service Spirit provides to us for free.
<br>
<br>
But you are correct about my having to change my approach, and how I present the things I have to share.  It will take some time yet before I have a good handle on how to help others to open when they have been closed-off to other opportunities.
<br>
<br>
Truth against the world is not an attitude, nor a belief, it is the way it really is Kenneth in the current world climate we live in and have lived in for as long as those in power keep us in the dark... remember "A Bug's Life 2".. If the Ants realize they are powerful, then those who now control them will lose control !!!    And so it is in the world now, and in spiritual matters.
<br>
<br>
Most people will only accept Belief attack when the person attacking those beliefs are well known, have a reputation in their field, have published books etc, and generally SEEM to be Experts..  with the proper qualifications.  Witness the reliance on Robert Bruce's assertions and presentations of his astral experiences... he is the expert in a lot of peoples eyes, yet I don't see him like that at all !!  I see a man who is my equal, having had no more or clearer Astral experiences for just as long as I have.  So why is RB held to be the expert ?  Because he has published books on it, that share his experiences, whether those experiences are always clear truths or not by anyone else's experiences and perceptions.
<br>
<br>
Look at how much difficulty Jesus had in trying to get people to understand that we are all equals and all powerful beings capable of 'miracles' too.   They supposedly killed him !!  And if I recall, he too was opposed to the way things were, because the simple truth he was aware of went against the standard belief-systems of his time !
<br>
<br>
Yes, kill the messenger is still a favorite approach these days too.
<br>
<br>
The upshot of all this is I see that the current belief-system structures have to follow their path to the natural conclusions.. usually an ending, before the new can come into being here.  So with that in mind I will continue to plant seeds everywhere and work on changing the way I approach people with my sharing.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again Kenneth, and sorry about the length of this reply.

Tayesin,
<br>
<br>
I would suggest you change the topic to that as I did above, as I think if you want to change things on larger scales you must start by appealing to the masses in a way that is comforting and welcoming and positive.  "The Truth against the world" is a statement that seems to me to attract enemies or maybe even a way to create a conflict or maybe inflame a conflict that already existed.  I think we can do better by taking someone's hand and saying, "Let's go have some fun together by developing our abilities together and doing good things."  I believe that doing what's right is being in a happy and positive state of mind and making more friends all along the way.

Tayesin
<br>
if i may add my humble opinion on this matter ...
<br>
i think, from what i saw up to date, that you locked yourself within paradigm of showing people "the truth", or at least showing them that there is something more, and divide the world accordingly, and judge people accordingly to that belief (if i may call that crusade)
<br>
frankly speaking the guest book on soulwork opened my mind to that
<br>
as well as silence in some matters
<br>
<br>
even worse, you think that you got it, well, of course you say that you are still learning and similiar things, but that is not true, these are only words
<br>
<br>
"Witness the reliance on Robert Bruce's assertions and presentations of his astral experiences... he is the expert in a lot of peoples eyes, yet I don't see him like that at all !! I see a man who is my equal, having had no more or clearer Astral experiences for just as long as I have."
<br>
<br>
that is correct, from what you said you travel astrally for 25 years, but ...
<br>
i see regret in your words, that Bruce has the authority and you don't (comparing of course, you have greater authority than most)
<br>
regret = struggle against the reality, you use the energy not on showing people new possiblities, but on ...  your emotions, and digging bruce authority becouse he is a competition to you, what strikes me funny is that you think that you are better than them becouse you don't charge money etc etc (another example of your duality, doesn't sound like enlightened being, heh), while in fact you use the very same techniques
<br>
<br>
so now something that may struck you odd
<br>
JUST BECOUSE YOU DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO IT, AND SPEND 25 YEARS DOING IT, DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE RIGHT
<br>
<br>
thank you for your participation

Hi Daem0n,
<br>
I didn't take anything you wrote as an attack my friend, I see you are performing an imprtant service on my behalf, one that will help me to grow further through the ancient method of statement, testing,re-evaluation and adjusted statement.  And I thank you dearly for this.
<br>
<br>
You are correct in saying I have locked myself into showing that there are simpler ways to reach your own awareness levels.  And what they get from it is their Truths.  And the naming as a Crusade is also correct.
<br>
<br>
But my friend, I don't Judge People.  ONLY the old ways that keep them down, as shown by all belief system structures, and if that illustrates something about the purveyors then so be it.
<br>
<br>
quote,
<i>
 "even worse, you think that you got it, well, of course you say that you are still learning and similiar things, but that is not true, these are only words"
</i>
<br>
<br>
I say I am learning still because it is True, Daem0n.  There is so much further to open up to, that I am fully aware I do not have IT... if there is such a thing.  But what I do 'have' is also more than what many others have experienced as yet in their lives, and some may not come to it this life either.
<br>
<br>
quote,
<i>
 "that is correct, from what you said you travel astrally for 25 years, but ...

</i>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps my words were poorly chosen if you got this from what I said.  Yes I do think it better to not charge megabucks.. and even more so to not charge at all so that people from all walks of life can afford it, instead of just the richer people.
<br>
<br>
Yes I would like to have the 'authority' as RB does, not for me or my ego, but because it would mean I could reach so many more people !!  And my desire is to share with as many people as possible in this life.  I don't see RB as competition either, he is obviously very good at what he does and for that I support his work.  My point was in the perception that if you have not the qualifications (authority) then you get no where in the Industry-controlled new age.  This is a fact that cannot be denied.
<br>
<br>
Neither do I see myself as better than RB, but I am his equal... as you are, and as we all are.  So why the veneration ?  See, the perception and belief structure of the system Daem0n where we put such people on a pedestal ?  We do it with most of the people who are explorers and leaders, instead of seeing them as equals who can show us another way.  Again, I use Jesus as an illustration for this.
<br>
<br>
As for "enlightened being", by who's standard is Enlightenment Judged ?  Is it from the ancient belief-system of the Buddhists, or the popularization of the concept in recent years ?  Jesus was an enlightened being yet he still showed anger and all the other human traits that had people thinking he couldn't be enlightened because he didn't act like an enlightened being should !
<br>
<br>
As mentioned to you before Daem0n, Enlightenment is not in any way, shape or form relevant to what the Belief sytems tell us that it HAS to be.  Enlightenment is dynamic at times, subdued at others and totally lacking in others... this is how it is for a person who has had that experience in this culture.  Had I chosen to be born in an Eastern Culture it may well have been manifest differently !   This is the reality, not the fiction of it.  Even the Enlightened are still human and still learning !!
<br>
<br>
quote,
<i>
 "so now something that may struck you odd
 <br>
 JUST BECOUSE YOU DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO IT, AND SPEND 25 YEARS DOING IT, DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE RIGHT"
</i>
<br>
<br>
Does this also not apply to RB, and the millions of others who are working in the Industry Daem0n ?  What I have I share equally, I seek no glory for it, no pedestal, no riches etc.   What I have works for every person I have shared it with in circles etc.  What I am doing is based solely on the words of Jesus... "Give a man fish and you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish and you feed him for life"
<br>
<br>
So it is not about being right.  It is about breaking through the old concepts, breaking the cycle of dependance on those who charge highly for their services when the Creator supplies it for Free.  That isn't about right or wrongness Daem0n, it just is how it is, whether anyone believes it or not.   And the idea of right versus wrong is an out of date concept too.
<br>
<br>
There is what is and what works, and then there is what Belief systems tell us HAS to be right and wrong.  What side would you choose to be on Daem0n ?  Because you do have to choose a side Daem0n !!!   We cannot sit on a fence meditating and Om-ing while the struggles for power continue around us, and while the earth is subdued by Dark Forces.
<br>
<br>
So yes, you are either for or against in this ONE respect.  You are either helping to solve the dilemnas or you are helping to keep the Status-Quo... there is no middle ground in this time, we all must choose !
<br>
<br>
quote,
<i>
 "since you know your past lives, how many times you travelled this path ?? "
</i>
<br>
<br>
LOL, probably many, many thousands here and in other worlds.   Perhaps this time I will move through the attitude/issue I have that is holding me back currently.  I'm starting to look at it more positively of late, after having some small breakthroughs on a daily level.
<br>
<br>
No, I haven't read the Soul-healer site all the way through.  What I saw so far impressed me for the fact that I see what they are getting at in the bigger picture and that excites me too.  It is where I am heading at the moment.. with the slow development of a whole healing ability based on the simple methods to reach the awareness levels required.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, the Truth I spoke about meant as in Living Truthfully, as completely opposed to the current way we humans live, which is dis-honest to ourselves, the world that supports us and all those we are in contact with..... hence the threads title.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Daem0n.

<br>
complaining that bruce has authority and you don't doesn't lead anywhere, and that was my point (a lot of misunderstanding here, heh, gladly switch to telepathy)
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
when i have to pay big buck for anything, or really any bucks, i find my way around, and this is challenge to me, or rather way to transcend myself on my own or summoning my own gaurdians/spirits etc (via soulwork i got quite a few willing to facilitate me, as well as few that tried to suck me, well, they are transmutated now, another lesson for me)
<br>
and of course, the lesson i learned from you (or rather your current situation), i have no authorities anymore, and try out everything for myself
<br>
<br>
"As mentioned to you before Daem0n, Enlightenment is not in any way, shape or form relevant to what the Belief sytems tell us that it HAS to be. Enlightenment is dynamic at times, subdued at others and totally lacking in others... this is how it is for a person who has had that experience in this culture. Had I chosen to be born in an Eastern Culture it may well have been manifest differently ! This is the reality, not the fiction of it. Even the Enlightened are still human and still learning !! "
<br>
<br>
now i understand that enlighment was a kind of authority there, thing that limited me becouse of expectations associated with it, and i drop it on all levels i have access to NOW, i thank you for that, however i was aware of "fluency" of it
<br>
<br>
"quote, "so now something that may struck you odd
<br>
JUST BECOUSE YOU DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO IT, AND SPEND 25 YEARS DOING IT, DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE RIGHT"
<br>
<br>
Does this also not apply to RB, and the millions of others who are working in the Industry Daem0n ? What I have I share equally, I seek no glory for it, no pedestal, no riches etc. What I have works for every person I have shared it with in circles etc. What I am doing is based solely on the words of Jesus... "Give a man fish and you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish and you feed him for life"
<br>
<br>
So it is not about being right. It is about breaking through the old concepts, breaking the cycle of dependance on those who charge highly for their services when the Creator supplies it for Free. That isn't about right or wrongness Daem0n, it just is how it is, whether anyone believes it or not. And the idea of right versus wrong is an out of date concept too. "
<br>
<br>
this is not about it being right or wrong (again, words here), but of speaking from a point when you "know it", which i must admit triggered compassion response from me, and i have my suspicions that too many people quite different emotional ones that would rather create struggle than objective thoughts
<br>
<br>
there is no more status quo, as you know, earth awakened, i am with her, but this is my last incarnation on earth (if i don't screw things up immensly, of course) and don't want to become involved fully
<br>
living truthfully to oneself or everything, i can't tell people what i know if they ask me outwardly, at least not without few hours talk given that they want to listen

 "Man is what he believes"
</i>
. You cannot condemn a man's beliefs so blatantly, so convictingly. We each hold on to our beliefs and won't lay them down for anything, however ridiculous and absurd they may be, in fact as daem0n said they may in fact be true to them and seem a perfectly normal way of living. I recently came into contact with someone who assertively believed in Communism and extreme national policies such as mandatory religion ect. I could not resist the urge to argue his beliefs, pointing out how the Communist regime in Russia failed and how equality between us cannot be attained, and how theory is not practice, and how capital-owned enterprise, standardised income levels ect. is not better. But he would not listen. In fact he became very defensive and insulted. Perhaps because I viewed his beliefs as incorrect, when for me it is true that modern Capitalism is better than Communism, but who am I to say?
<br>
<br>
Tayesin, I found your first post very inspiring. The common way of life towards the center of the norm is built on outdated principles and obsolete ideologies. I see this in every corner of the world, but can often condense it down to the spectrum of spiritual values vs. materialistic values. We can apply either in life situations, it just so happens that most people choose the latter. This has lead to the progressive involution of humanity and the widening gap between materialism and spirituality.
<i>
 "Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality"
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I too can sense that our materialist state has been stagnant for too long and seems to be getting worse. It is urgent that we take up a spiritual outlook on life and evolve in our world. This statement may seem too like it is pushing a belief, but no belief needs to be pushed. All we are required to do is lay down our beliefs, all of them, and see what really is - and yes as Covelo said, sometimes to just observe and laugh at how ridiculous it all is. No belief is required. Only observation. One can choose the higher order of life or lower order of life at any given moment. These are not belief systems, only divine truths. No truth can be imposed on a man; one must learn to discover a truth for himself, not his own truth but the truth of life. It seems hard to change people's views about the urgency to undertake a spiritual outlook on life, and I would not recommend it. Instead of trying to change others, the best thing to do is to change yourself. Instead of telling, show and inspire. Many people will ridicule, you cannot tell someone such simple truths. I have tried ruthlessly, with people most close to me and have only received rejection and ridicule in return. You can only lead people to discover this by themselves. You can only walk someone to the door. They have to walk through it themselves. You cannot walk another's path for them, only they can walk the path and discover the truth for themselves.

laugh inside yourself, i have enough trouble with uncontrollable laughter myself
<br>
it seems that everyone in the begginning is astonished with simplicty (or complexity) of reality, and wants to share it / show it to everyone, and then he discovers that these truths are not so simple, and that he is thus separeted from the general society (and at the same time more connected to them then ever before), this is how it goes, we have to become immune to it before we can show another way
<br>
don't try it earlier, or rather try it for yourself to understand more

Hi,
<br>
Covelo,
<br>
Thank you for your kind words.  I'll try to keep it up, LOL
<br>
<br>
Alexd,
<br>
I agree that most people have trouble with the simplicity of it all, as we are very definately indoctrinated into thinking and believing that it HAS to be difficult.
<br>
<br>
Also, recently I have been having serious doubts about the Theory of us being what we believe, or that our beliefs manifest our realities.  And I base this non-conformist approach to the theory on having experienced that it is not so.  I do not believe in anything, I have experiences then form opinions on them instead of believing firstly then possibly experiencing it.  Nor do I establish a belief about what I experienced after the fact.  I simply report it as it is.  Because I experience as if naked, meaning to have no expectations, beliefs, or other impediments, I see clearly what I am experiencing for what it is and not what a Belief-system tells me I have to.
<br>
<br>
For example...  I have never held the belief in Angels, as per the historic christian concept of them, nor the new-age concept..  yet in the past few months a real angel-type being has been about when I am focused in the higher-awareness levels of the Self/Soul.  According to the Belief Theory, because I do not believe, then it should not be in my reality.  Yet here I am telling you this fact, I have seen and worked with an Angel called A-Riel (arial, U-riel) this last few months.  Because I am well experienced in the astral realms and soul levels I KNOW that this Being is a real entity.
<br>
<br>
Daem0n,
<br>
quote by,
<i>
 "this is not about not judging people but their beliefs, but not judging at all"
</i>
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are correct in pointing this out.  Non-judgement is the preffered way of course.  But hay, I'm still human and working on it.
<br>
<br>
quote,
<i>
 "by stating that you think you got it, i meant that you seem to jugde people's beliefs from your own point of view
 <br>
 it's a matter of leaving people open door, only they can cross them, and refuse to do that out of fear, but that doesn't mean i will be sitting and encouraging them all the time"
</i>
<br>
<br>
I understand what you are saying, as it is the way I was taught to do things too.  But, I'm not trying to push people to the door.   I am trying to show, in this blinded-atmosphere we call human awareness, that there is an easier way to get what you want in your spiritual growth.  One that will take years off your search and bring you to Clear higher-awareness much more easily that what is currently on offer.
<br>
<br>
What the problem I face is,  people don't think it can be easier because just about everyone before me says it's hard to do !!  They say this based firmly on the belief-sytem rules that they are attached to.  And the other problem I finally became aware of, apart from my approach at times, is that people's minds may blank out at the word Simple.. some people see it as meaning I am saying they are stupid because they see they can't do this.. in their mind.   Which is not what I have ever said !
<br>
<br>
These perceptions, also based on Belief-ststem rules, is preventing them from reading just the words they see and understanding them in the way they are intended.  It's just human nature at this level.  Maybe, what I want to share with everyone is just too simple, so the average-mind that has been indoctrinated into it's behaviours cannot get into it.
<br>
<br>
Please understand this Daem0n, I wasn't complaining about RB's authority, I was illustrating a point about how people will not listen to others who really do have something valuable to share... unless they have the books, or other things seen as Qualifications.  That is all.  Not complaining, just illustrating !
<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree there is a considerable mis-understanding happening in our conversation.  This may well be due to the cultural-word perception differences, as each culture actually does see the same sentence quite differently.  Which is why I am posting at the Pulse in the first place.. to get a handle on how to express these different concepts so that as many people as possible will understand the meaning of the words used.  Good Training Ground this place.
<br>
<br>
Add to this factor the differences in personal perceptions and I am surprised we even can work out each others intentions !  LOL
<br>
<br>
I'm so glad to read you have reached the point of knowing you must find you answers for yourself, as no others can provide them to you.  Excellent
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
As a personal opinion of my own, I do not understand why so many people want to think this is their last incarnation here.  When the Earth and all that dwell upon her moves through the vibration levels and settles in (so to say) there will be many more great Experiences for us Souls to choose incarnating here for.  I have already chosen to come back as often as possible over the next thousand years.. it's exciting times ahead and I want to be here for it.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again Daem0n.

yes, i know what was your point with RB, however if you won't handle your words carefully all message will be belittled, and it happened to me quite a few times(cultural adjusting one may say), even to the extent when i was ridiculed when i blurted out that aura of my friend looks beautiful in the sunlight, i can only laugh what would happen when i would start describing what happened to me, LOL
<br>
<br>
as for this being my last incarnation on earth, i haven't made it up, it just came to me as realization, and when i ask myself (high self too) i get the same answer without any doubt, well it doesn't matter anyway, i wouldn't change anything in my path even if i were to stay here more, it's funny how i get useless information that doesn't change anything, and yet people are dedicating lifetimes to those
<br>
<br>
alexd
<br>
about beliefs systems, guides are usually adjusting to those
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
when you expect nothing you may get true form, dunno
<br>
i don't really believe in it, when i get new information that contradicts the previous one, i test both and choose the one that offers greater opportunity
<br>
<br>
what i was trying to say that each truth offers different opportunities to grow, and that there is no absolute truth
<br>
if someone doesn't believe in angels, he has reasons to do so and thus he won't see any angels
<br>
but that doesn't mean that angels won't interfere with his life, he will just be unaware of it
<br>
saying that, when you have expectations you corrupt the flow of data to your mind, not reality
<br>
it came to me now as insight, cool
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
but you have to take into account that as each thought has energy, each disbelief has minute effect on the reality
<br>
so if someone is passionate communism, it will manifest mainly in his life and himself, becouse these are areas he has power over (to some extent, that is), but he won't be able to affect your reality
<br>
and now we have mages/adepts, which can affect your reality due to energizing thought, and finding energy resources to sustain them (plenty of those, average tree will do)
<br>
without expectations, they have relatively unobscured flow, and thus they can manifest what they want in their lives
<br>
all of us do so, but most of it is unconscious
<br>
you can strike a deal with your subconscious
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
, to make it manifest your will (if it shifts towad more pleasure, bliss for example, it will go on it's own accord, but you have to ask him)
<br>
the same iwth high self, if you have big enough picture (for example multidimensional reality), true self (preprogrammed for this incarnation, normally obscured with conditioning), core self (just wills) and concious self - that is YOU, if you don't really want it you want get it, the more you want it the harder it is to get it, there is a way out of it, but you have to find it for yourself
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
<br>
and many more, which i can't recall now

take care

Hi,
<br>
Quote by Daem0n,
<i>
 "however if you won't handle your words carefully all message will be belittled, and it happened to me quite a few times(cultural adjusting one may say), even to the extent when i was ridiculed when i blurted out that aura of my friend looks beautiful in the sunlight, i can only laugh what would happen when i would start describing what happened to me, LOL "
</i>
<br>
<br>
I for one would like to hear what you experienced during that event.
<br>
<br>
You are correct my friend.  This too has been my experience, as you know.  This may sound harsh or egotistical, but these next words are a quote from the old woman who is performing mentorship for me in this phase of growth, and was her response to my difficulty in getting Simplicity of the ground in the world..
<i>
 "You can do nothing to help all those who are stuck in small-mindedness".
</i>
<br>
<br>
At first I had an emotional response to her statement, thinking she was being harshly critical of other people or my path.  Then as the months progressed I began to see clearly that she was correct... with no value judgements aimed at anyone.  In fact, in all the years I have known her she has never once been nasty to anything that lives, and this helped me clear my own mis-perceptions of her original statement.
<br>
<br>
Since Indoctrinated small-mindedness is what prevents other people from hearing or reading, then understanding the message, it begins to hark back to an ancient concept from the Bible... Not to throw pearls before swine.
<br>
<br>
Before anyone jumps on me for that...
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
I never agreed with the statement in the first place, as to me it was making Value-Judgements about who can and who cannot be helped to opening their awareness further..  and you all know I think each and everyone one of us deseves to know they can do it easier and should therefore have the opportunity and information made available to them.
<br>
<br>
But, what I have discovered is that even some people will have the experience of Self for themself and completely miss the Importance of it in their lives !!!
<br>
<br>
So, if we were to change the emotionally laden Biblical-words to something like... "Try not to throw away the gifts you share with those who will not see it's value as a gift."   That sounds much better to me, LOL.
<br>
<br>
But it still flies in the face of my thinking that everyone deserves to know for themself that they are Great Spirits in their own right, and that it is themself who has the power to choose and grow in this life to KNOW who and what they really are as Souls.  And here lies the conundrum... again.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully my almost finished book will put it out there for all those who are ready to take the next step in their personal evolution... and also hopefully, those who read it will experiment for themselves then discard the book completely !
<br>
<br>
Thanks guys.

oh, it was nothing particularily interesting, but then i just jumped at new level of auric sight, from seing the outline to outer shells of the aura, and in sunlight it was bright yellow mixed with other hues, that was first time when i saw it
<br>
<br>
as for quoting, aleister crowley was painfully right, dogs deserve to die
<br>
at first it didn't seem right, dogs being so nasty word and such, but eventually i understood after few talks that it was accurate
<br>
<br>
the journey of a thousand miles beggins with a single step, beautiful sentence, we would agree
<br>
but only if you are willing to take a step, brings it deeper doesn't it
<br>
then another, and another
<br>
<br>
those few people i met that were experienced in magic were always brought down by themselves, their emotions and fears, i'll give examples
<br>
talented hermetic mage, unstable becouse of fears of insecurity
<br>
intuitive seer that was more interested in normal life than pushing further
<br>
lightworker who broke down after almost killing person with her wish, and rejecting her gifts (empath too)
<br>
plain lazy psychic, very talented i must admit
<br>
thelemic mage limited by his "dark" style and judgement, he is pushing further, but at slow rate
<br>
<br>
it's funny that people think that metaphysics will solve their problems, when they amplify them
<br>
i achieved rudimentary balance before i started anything,  using only NEW  to remove blockages, after few swings i eventually stabilized myself
<br>
perhaps that is the reason why i am willing to move further, maybe not
<br>
i hope that someone will get something out of these words, i really do,
<br>
too much is wasted already

Mike: Everything we materialise within the physical is already within the non-physical. Every TV program, every song, every piece of music, every radio broadcast, in fact everything and anything any of us (in whatever physical era) have either invented, are currently inventing, or ever will invent, is
<u>
 already
</u>
present within the non-physical.
<br>
<br>
In the past, people have represented this phenomenon in various ways. Perhaps the most common being the notion of Akashic Records. In turn, people have naturally allied this idea to the physical representation of what we call a library. But, as is normal, people's knowledge and thinking moves on, to the extent where the old notions are being dropped in favour of a greater understanding of the reality. Like you say, anything and everything is possible via the correct attunement. Which is one of those things that is easier said than done, but far easier to do while non-physical. Well, that's my experience.
<br>
<br>
Within the Exchange Territories (Monroe's old Focus 27) people live very much like they did while physical. As such, they have friends, family and so forth. In my experience people form family groups based on many factors. Such as, like you say, could be members of a physical-life family, or whatever. People choose to incarnate together, for example, and afterwards they might have a chuckle about their adventures, and all that kind of thing. There's a myriad of reasons.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
