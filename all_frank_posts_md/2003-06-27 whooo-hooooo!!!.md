Yes!  Victory!!!  **dances around a bit**
<br>
<br>
Ok..I will calm down to tell you what happened..
<br>
<br>
Woke up around 6am this morning. (hubby stayed home cause I am going to get some out patience stuff done today)  sooo I said..alright I am going down to the couch (cause of the snoring) He said "good-luck" and went back to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I get comfortable on the couch.. and do my relaxing tech.  But for some reason after a while (30-40 min) my legs start feeling uncomfortable..I turn onto my right side.. and within as few minutes  the vibrations are all over the place!  I then start looking out my astral eyes..everything is blurry and I ask for "clarity" doesn't really work except now I see my hubby standing in front of.. (I'm still on my side)  I think oh great he has come down to check on me again..but I look a little closer and his body looked all sparkly.. I tried to get up..but was sooooooooooooo heavy.. I hate that part..I can't get up!  So, I say Screw it..I will go into a dream and wake up there.. cause that does seem to be my thing.
<br>
<br>
Next thing I know I am standing next to this line of people..I have no idea what they are doing but I walk up to them and I poke one of them and say "Hey, Man you're in a dream..wake up"! they just keep walking real slowly past me in this line..lol...so each person that walked past me I would poke them and say this...most of them didn't even look at me..But I did notice that each and everyone of those people were different.. I mean a woman, man, black, white, younger, older, ect...One girl had a lot of freckles on her face and I tried to get her to look at me but to no avail..Buuuuuut the guy behind her was starting to take notice...YES!  he looked like a teenager..big kid I got the impression he played football.. so I went up to him and pushed him in the shoulder and said "Hey..you're in a dream..come on wake up".. he looked down at me and smiled..
<br>
<br>
Then I believe he "put" me in his dream...does that make sense?
<br>
We were in a house..I could describe but not important.. It was quite the boring dream actually.. we sat around drinking tea.. I know we had pleasant conversation..but eh...I have forgotten..
<br>
All of a sudden I say.."oh, someone is coming...gotta go" I got up ran for the front door and it opened right as I reached for the handle.  So I let the door open and I hid behind it as it opened..
<br>
<br>
I had this stupid 'you caught me look and grin on my face' when the guy closed the door and looked at me...lol...But he was cool and not surprised.. so I went outside and stood in the middle fo the street.
<br>
It was deserted and was dark but there were plenty of street lights on.  I was looking down the street to the left thinking of what to do next, when this guy with a bright red sweater and black pants was flying 4ft above the street.. I think he was on a broom...lol...
<br>
Soooo there he was coming down the street at me.. and the thought that crossed my mind was..*snicker*  I am going to knock him down..*snicker* or stick out my leg and trip him up...OH, MY!  I would not be this mean in the "real world" I thought.  So I just let him fly right by me...and woke up!
<br>
<br>
I ran up stairs and told the hubby..his eyes glaze over and he says the polite..."that's nice, Honey"  the time was 9:02.. when I got up stairs.
<br>
<br>
Sooooo...what was with the line?  They didn't really walk drunk or anything.. just real slow and looked straight ahead..
<br>
<br>
It was great fun!  Can't wait for the next time.. I will work on the heavy feeling..but if it's easier for me to wake up in a dream....why do I need to be conscious of the split?
<br>
<br>
thanks for listening!
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Asisya! Whoo Hoo..it's only a matter of time before I come get you!

<br>
That was an interesting account.
<br>
<br>
You will find, Nay (and I talked on another post yesterday about this so it might be worthwhile digging out the post. Trusting guides was the title) within the Astral are all manner of people engaged in all kinds of activities. Some will be "open" to you and with others all you'll get is a blank stare. This is because their attention is focussed completely on the activity in question.
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like you projected to somewhere around the Focus 24 state. Most people here are actually people who have died physically and can be found absorbed in some mundane activity to the extent where they can't perceive you. Within these realms, like attracts like. So people lost, find themselves amongst other people lost. Then one or two of them might begin walking in some direction or other, and so everyone follows.
<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as "time" within these realms. Plus, there is no need to eat or excrete or sleep; no bills to pay; no work to go to; and such like. So there are no natural interrupts that come about forcing these people to, in some way, "snap out of it".
<br>
<br>
One of the challenges of doing rescue work, for example, is somehow getting these people to actually, "snap out of it". Whereupon they begin to notice you. As you have found, doing this can be rather difficult.
<br>
<br>
I feel an interesting situation was about to develop with the youngster. Many times, upon making contact, I have suddenly been transported to some scene or other. Very often you can become placed in a situation where you are viewing events through their eyes.
<br>

Congrats Nay!
<br>
<br>
I normally dont poke people, but I do try to talk to everyone.  Its funny because I get those same blank stares or a quick hello and then back to whatever they were doing.
<br>
<br>
I was in a grocery store in one and I was a little confused why these people were so into grocery shopping since I assumed it was a dimention they didnt need to eat in.  Maybe they were dreaming and it was a locale of sorts.   I expected them to start talking to me and have all types of wisdom instead you get the blank stare and a "hi" then back to shopping.
<br>
<br>
its kinda funny in a way.

People within the region of Focus 23/24 can often be seen just generally drifting about doing aimless things. Either singularly or in groups of various sizes. What has happened is these people have died physically, but there has been a degree of confusion and/or fear to the extent where their progress to the upper regions has been thwarted.
<br>
<br>
They are able to think. Problem is, though, their thoughts tend to get stuck just going around and around in the same loop.

<br>
<br>
There are people (especially from the Moen-school,
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/wwwboard/wwwboard.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/wwwboard/wwwboard.html
</a>
) who specialise in trying to interrupt the train of thought of people who get stuck in these regions. As I say above, they can think but they just keep thinking the same thing.
<br>
<br>
The reason why this is possible, is simply because within the Astral there are none of the usual kinds of interrupts we have while Physical; for example, you may have the sensation of being trapped in some circumstance within a dream, but it's only a matter of time before your alarm-clock goes off, or you feel the need to use the toilet, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
People who attempt these kinds of rescues have to be quite creative in their approach. Somehow you need to interrupt the thought-loop of the person being rescued. This can take a high degree of sensitivity with the more difficult cases.
<br>
<br>
Ginny is our resident expert on this, and she has posted several examples of her work.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Nay,
<br>
<br>
You can get a good idea, as Frank mentioned, of the Bruce Moen retrieval process by taking a look at some of Ginny's threads. This is a good one:
<br>

<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3059" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3059
</a>
<br>
<br>
Also, and I have Frank to thank for this, my astral program has shifted from the traditional obe to astral phasing. In other "stickies" in the Astral Consciousness forum Frank has a
<br>
number of helpful posts that go into what this is. He explains the process better than I ever could. I would invite you to read over those posts as they are both instructive and fascinating.
<br>
<br>
Finally, when we talk of C1, F10, F12, etc., that is simply "Monroespeak", after Robert Monroe who coined these terms that refer to the states from normal waking consciousness to various levels of the nonphysical realms. As you may be aware, Mr. Monroe wrote three books:
<i>
 Journeys Out of the Body
</i>
,
<i>
 Far Journeys
</i>
, and
<i>
 Ultimate Journey
</i>
and The Monroe Institute is named after him.

Monroe, when he came to plot non-physical regions in his attempts to make some kind of modern-day sense of it all, labelled the various places with an arbitrary series of numbers he called: Focus Levels.
<br>
<br>
He found that each region (or plane or realm, whatever you prefer to call it) contained people with a number of characteristics in common. This is how, on reading your post, I immediately could tell from your description of the people there, which Focus Level you had most likely projected to.
<br>
<br>
As you experience the Astral more and more, you'll get to see all manner of people in all manner of circumstances. But you should begin to detect the main differences that indicate to you where you are in the general scheme of things. There is a basic explanation given here...

Eyes glazed over is a common sign of someone caught in a thought-fuelled loop. Within themselves there could be quite a lot of mental activity going on. Unfortunately, their attention has become consumed by it... to the extent where their ability to act independently has been severely hampered.
<br>
<br>
Don't worry about failing to step back and take-in the wider picture. Once you have come across a number of similar situations you will, I'm sure, be able to act with a higher degree of proficiency. It's just a question of practice.
<br>
<br>
Gosh, the number of times I came back to C1 and kicked myself thinking, "Why on earth didn't I just..." But by then it's too late. In the beginning (and I fully include myself here) people tend to act like the proverbial bull in a china-shop. But, with practice, you will learn how to operate with an ever higher degree of tact and sensitivity.

I think you were in the midst of a "rescue" of the kind that people such as Ginny, for example, regularly get involved with. The person who entered the room, I strongly suspect was a person from a higher realm who had arrived to take the boy to a place where his development could continue (as opposed to being stuck aimlessely wandering about the lower Astral).
<br>
<br>
This person too, I suspect, was who transported you both to the room. In my experience, this kind of transitory scenario occurs fairly regularly. It is done in order to get the subject out of their current situation, and allows an opportunity to gain the subject's confidence to the extent where they forget their previous situation and are, therefore, open to moving away to new and better circumstances.

Here is an idea about those zombie-like people who were walking in a line. Perhaps at least some of those people were actual dreamers. They could have been either in deep dream-less sleep or engaged in normal non-lucid sleep dreams.
<br>
Here there could be 2 possibilities. Either 1) some of those dreamers were actually out of body. In that case, Nay, you could have encountered them in the RTZ (ethereal plane).
<br>
Or 2) they were in a dream reality and you entered their dreams and intereacted with them there.
<br>
Either way it does suggest some very interesting possibilities.

WOW!  I got chills when I read this..Ever since I read one of Ginny's retrieval for the first time..(a few months ago) I have a more than average interest in it. For a long as I can remember, in my dreams I am saving people or animals. Of course, I am not under the illusion that I have been doing retrieval all this time.. because I had no idea what I was doing (but in my dreams have a strong need to help)  I find this paticular experience more than a mere coincidence due to the fact I have been thinking long and hard about "retrievals"
<br>
I will be ordering a book or two from Mr. Moen's website, and learn as much as I can!  Another thing..I find it fasinating that I "just knew" someone was coming [^] It is kinda hard to explain cause it really wasn't a thought that "popped" into my head..it was just there..a knowing..oh, well..the whole thing was just too awesome!
