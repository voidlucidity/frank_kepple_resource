I've never had that experience. But what I have seen is that my experiences change over time --- like I didn't experience the exit for a long time, then I did. For a while, the chakra sensations were one thing, then they modified, and again. Sometimes it feels like once you get the hang of 'how it works' it changes on you.
<br>
<br>
My advice is to keep working with it see where it takes you.  Give it a couple weeks.

From what RB says you probably missed the exit. I have not seen a lot of talk of missing exits on this board so i have doubted that it happens much,or if it does we never notice, though i think it happened to me once. one time I reched a stage similar to yours, then i felt this subtle ripping going up from my toes, and i was left pretty much paralyzed. did not have trouble moving later but i did not remember anything.

Patty,  i too have not yet  developed the mental falling exercisese to work efficiently.....
<br>
Ralphm...  what do you mean "missed" the exit ??  is there a limeted time for you to attempt an exit before your body says "too bad, try again tommorow, you aint getting another chance tonight"    because i never get the vibrations twice in a night....

Does the swishing sound feel like it is coming from the top of your head?
<br>
<br>
If so, sounds to me like you are right on the verge of separation. I'd bet that you just began to separate, but your protective sense of conscious awareness hauled you back to the Physical.
<br>
<br>
This is very *normal* and should stop once it gets used to the rising/falling sensation. But after that there will be loads more strange sensations it will have to get used to also.

I had an experience very similar to this falling thing your talking about and it scared the crap out of me. Because, I was floatin around my room all happy staring at my boyfriend and then it got black and the swish sound and I fell right into myself and my eyes popped open. I jolted straight up and caught my breath and was just WOW! I'd only violently fallen into myself a couple of times so it was a little shocking. Maybe you had an obe but just weren't aware of your surroundings and your body wanted you back. Anyway, I'd take it as a positive sign that you are getting closer to "full" obe.

The feel of falling downward could also be a myoclonic jerk, which is normal when your body is falling asleep.   Yours is probably what everybody else is talking about though, but I know it's happened on more than a couple of occasions with me.

It's a bodily function, usually caused by falling asleep while you're still somewhat aware.  (There's something similar called a hypnic jerk I think.)  Scientists still aren't sure what causes it, but they think it's the body's reaction to your lowering vital signs.  Sometimes it will be accompanied by a brief mini-dream or vision of you falling or sliding or something, which makes it even more profound.  When you jerk awake though, you don't always know that you actually physically moved.  You just sense it as being suddenly awake.  Just a thought.

Not to freak anyone out but there's also a form of epilepsy called myoclonic epilepsy.
<br>
It's symptoms include absence seizures ie. tending to stare into the blue, gaps in though processes, involuntary spasms especially in the shoulders, arms and legs in the mornings.  The onset of the symptoms is bettwee 8-20 years.
<br>
Could some of the effects we experience during meditation and relaxation especially re OB work be the result of an induced moyclonionc ep. episode?
<br>
It'd be nice to hear comments especially from any neurophysiologists on the board.

For what its worth, I have epilepsy.  The "grand mal" type (french for big-bad, I think), but I also have the symptoms you described above - - especially blanking-out during the day.  I have a reputation for being a Space Case.  Add this to being blonde, and . . . . well, Dumb Blonde Jokes abound!  Since I'm well aware of my high-IQ, I laugh it off, thinking, heh heh, this is a good disguise!
<br>
<br>
However, I don't think we should be too quick to conclude that there is a connection between epilepsy and sleep irregularities - - - although there might be.  Who knows!  Here's my take on things, though:
<br>
<br>
My neurologist told me that "Epilepsy" is just the term they use for "having seizures, but don't know why."   If they DID know why, the diagnosis would change to something like "Brain Tumor" or "Damage to the XYZ Lobe" or something like that.  Apparently, everyone on this earth has some threshold at which they will have a seizure.  Many of us have "low thresholds," or things about our brains that bring on seizures more easily.
<br>
<br>
Meaning, brain activity that might be a walk-in-the-park for you will completely take ME out !!!!
<br>
<br>
Also, if you tell a neurologist that you are having sleep paralysis or OBEs, he/she will write "sleep disorder" in your case file, and suggest a sleep aid.  Then again, you might have a neurologist like MINE - - - someone who was into transcendental meditation for years, someone who responded with, "COOL!"
<br>
<br>
Moral of the story: Pick your doctors carefully.
<br>
<br>
How you SEE yourself can make a big difference.  Many shamans of old had symptoms that today would be described as epilepsy.  I just think some of our brains are "different."  It can be a blessing or a curse, depending on what you define it and how you let it affect your life.

PS:  rodentmouse . . . multiple projections in one night are entirely possible, if they are done in rapid succession.  If you find yourself coming out of sleep paralysis and you want to push the envelope and try another one, try "sinking" back into it.  Kind of like falling backwards into a pool, but put some mental force into it.  A few nights ago I did it over and over until I could remember an OBE . . . I just wouldn't give up.

True. What I wanted to point out with my post were the similarities not a connection.
<br>
A couple of yers back I worked at the local central hosp. as a computing support guy and work a lot with the clin. neurophysiology dept. helping them out with the EEG equipment. After watching them interpret the graphs I commented that they pretty much get a feel for the plots and the doc said "yeah, you look at abt. a thousand of them and then you get a feeling for what what and what's not". ie. some of the stuff (or maybe most) that goes on in our brains is a total mystery.
