You can try to do it and tell us about it afterward. Getting the person's reaction afterward is an important step and that would be good to describe also.

Okay, with my wife's permission I have tried to do this many times. But, Physically, she cannot remember a thing about the incident.
<br>
<br>
I project into the RT-zone about our bedroom. Thing is, we've gone about this a number of times so her "Astral self" (for want of a better phrase) fully recognises me by know.
<br>
<br>
So we chat about all the usual stuff and especially about us recognising this, "in the morning when we wake up" and so forth. But next morning she remembers zilch.
<br>
<br>
Most frustrating.
<br>

Greetings,
<br>
<br>
I know a lady - an extremely high level projector - who often assists people to project while the are physically asleep.
<br>
<br>
In an effort to help the recollection process, she first charges their chakras, and then takes them immediately to a part of the Astral which is like a dense fog - the reason being to stablise the person in an environment which is not too stimulating, and which would cause reactions that would destablise things. One person she helped reported that he felt his chakras being charged with energy, and he then sort of "turned into smoke" and left through his Crown Chakra. He remembers the Astral environment, but then he heard other voices and got scared which caused him to return to his body. The voices where actually friends of the lady who had gone along as well, and were having a chat in the background - this is all in the Astral. The lady said that he suddenly faded and left upon hearing the voices.
<br>
<br>
This is why fully conscious projection from the mind awake/body asleep state is so important.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Well, not normally. Just now and again she'll say something like, "I had a really strange dream last night, etc." Problem is, she gets a little scared if I push it. I did go too far on one occasion so I'm very wary now.
<br>
<br>
The most frustrating thing is her "Astral self" (again for want of a better phrase) when she is asleep merely hovers around her physical body and is reluctant to leave it. We can chat with the same degree of clarity we have while Physical, but that is all she'll do. I asked both Harath and Freda (two regular guides) why this is and they told me not to interfere with the natural process.

Yours,
