<br>
Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya---A seer-sage and a visionary of the New Golden Era
<br>
His personality was a harmonious blend of a saint, spiritual scientist, yogi, philosopher, psychologist, writer, reformer, freedom fighter, researcher, eminent scholar and visionary. He pioneered the revival of spirituality and creative integration of the modern and ancient sciences and religion relevant in the challenging circumstances of the present times. In 1979, he founded the Brahmavarchas Research Institute, the research center in Haridwar (India) dedicated to the integration of the modern and ancient sciences in a practical way motivated by the noble goal of health and happiness for all. This center houses well equipped laboratories of Haemetology, Biochemistry, Neurophysiology, Cardiology, Phytochemistry, Psychometry, Yagyopathy etc.
<br>
At the age of 15, (Jan 18th, 1926) a great Himalayan yogi by the name of Swami Sarveshvaranandji appeared before him in astral body from the flame of the Dipaka (lamp) and guided him throughout his entire life. The next 24 years of his life were devoted to 24 Mahapurashcharanas –each consisting of the rhythmic recitation (japa) of 2.4 million Gayatri Mantra with strictest of disciplines. In 1943, he married Bhagwati Devi, and ever since, the saintly couple dedicatedly pursued the noble mission of spiritual upliftment of humankind.
<br>
Realizing the potential of inspiring literature and its relevance in the present era of intellectual evolution, he had chosen writing as the principal mode towards uprooting the evil tendencies and blind faith from people's minds and arousing the indwelling wisdom, strength and spiritual bliss. He wrote about 3000 enlightening books in Hindi on almost all topics concerning human life. He translated the entire Vedic Vangmaya (4 Vedas, 108 Upanishads, 18 Puranas etc.) in Hindi elucidating the tradition, style, universality and history of Vedic Literature. He also practiced higher-level Sadhana on the arduous heights of Himalayas several times and had established enliven contact with Rishis of Himalayas. During 1984-1986, he carried out the unique spiritual experiment of Sukshmikarana, meaning sublimation of vital force and physical, mental and spiritual energies. He authored a special set of 20 books highlighting the future of the world and conveying the message of the dawn of the New Era of Truth during the 21st Century. On 2nd June 1990, he voluntarily shed his physical sheath.

I started a little bit patelvipulk, but I have other books  that I have started before and need to finish also. There is a part that I thought was really good:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 Human body is endowed with divine potentials. The divine powers – the source of infinite virtues, strength and subliminal and gross creativity, powers, talents and prosperity – immanent in the cosmic expansion are also present in a human being. Therefore, there appears to be no real reason as to why one should be weak, deficient, or deprived of anything in this world. He, despite being a reflection of thy inspiration, remains ignorant of his original nature and indulges in the misuse and dissipation of the immense power subliminally present in his body. Thus, rather than being blessed by the divine potentials subliminally induced in his own self, because of his misdeeds and misunderstanding, he generates sorrow, delusion, tension, disgrace, disorder and indigence in his life in multiple ways...
</blockquote>
<br>
But I'll finish it in not a long time and get back on the subject....
<br>
<br>
Take care,[/quote]

Thanks for posting the quote from one of the book:
<br>
<br>
This is  my favorite part from the book: " The extra Sensory Potentials of the  Mind"
<br>
<br>
<br>
The sudden eruption of volcanoes, earthquakes, lightening, landslide may appear as supernatural phenomena or
<br>
God's 'anger' to an illiterate of science. Although it is difficult to predict or prevent such natural calamities, these
<br>
do have causal basis well within the laws of Nature. Even solar and lunar eclipses were thought as signs of ill omen
<br>
or devil's attack etc in the medieval era of ignorance. However, as we all know, scientific knowledge and awareness
<br>
have largely wiped out such misconceptions today. The scientific discoveries and technological developments of
<br>
today may appear magical to someone living in remote tribal conditions. From rail, airplane, radio, etc, to television,
<br>
spacecraft, nuclear weapons, computers, robots, etc, the scientific advancements have made the world a wonderland
<br>
or an alien planet for the people of the first centuries. But, as we know, there is nothing like a magic or mystery in
<br>
these achievements. These are the consequences of scientific decipheration of Nature, inquisitiveness, unperturbed
<br>
perseverance, collective hard work and sagacity of intelligent minds. Every development of science has a welldefined
<br>
theory and principles that make the corresponding technological products....
<br>
In fact there is nothing to be attributed as a 'magic' in this world. Efficient use of light effects and ability to make
<br>
movements quicker than the grasp of alert eyes and minds is found to work behind most of the magic-shows.
<br>
Hypnotism too makes such unbelievable effects and experiences possible. The extrasensory potentials and exceptional
<br>
acumen of spiritually enlightened personalities also appear to be astonishing or esoteric to many people. But these
<br>
'supernormal talents' are natural consequences of the aroused powers of the 'usually unknown' layers of mind and
<br>
the vital force; and work well within the disciplines of Nature. Some of us may regard them as supramental and
<br>
some as sheer fraud, depending upon our 'scientific thinking'. But in either case, our interpretations are wrong. In
<br>
each case such affirmations imply our ignorance, lack of deep comprehension, or incomplete knowledge of the
<br>
macrocosmic system of Nature and the limitless web of consciousness...
<br>
There is no place for arbitrary, casual, or vague events in the self-organizing, orderly system of Nature. Whatever we
<br>
tend to regard as exceptional or as a random coincidence, also is a consequence of well-defined causes and occurs as
<br>
per the 'plans' or 'orderly process' of this cosmic system. The major difference lies in the fact that we do not yet
<br>
know these causes or are unable to see the hidden basis or 'logic' in it in terms of our understanding of the scientific
<br>
foundation of the world and the existence of Nature.
<br>
The roots of life and expansion of Nature are not confined to what is known to the modern science so far. Even at the
<br>
level of biological substances, the physics and biophysics of life is yet far from being completely known. The same
<br>
is true of the mysteries of nature... The more we know it, the more appears to be unknown, hidden beneath its deeper
<br>
domains. Then how to comment on the limitless expansion of consciousness? Its subliminal horizons expand well
<br>
beyond the hidden folds of time. What kind of eternal causes and effects trigger the impulse of life is certainly more
<br>
intractable – if not impossible, to decode than elucidating the functional genomics of a human being.
<br>
Expression of the accumulated effects and assimilation of the deeds, thought waves and emotional vibrations of the
<br>
earlier lives is manifested in the yet inexplicable instances of 'random chance' or fate. We should keep our mind
<br>
open and endeavor elucidating this hidden science too.
<br>
<br>

Hi:

Just a thought... isn't "spiritual science" a contradiction in terms? :)
