Hello to everyone.
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to confirm my experiences with everyone.  I have been practicing Wave I Gateway with Major Tom's and Franks posts for guidance.  I have been using the visualization run down to keep my mind slightly focused.
<br>
<br>
Tonight I experienced what I could only say was quite pleasureable.  I seemed to sunk to some new level.   Hard to describe thought.  My body felt incredibly numb and it felt at times like my body was disassociated from my real body.  Kind of like being underground while the physical body is somewhere above

The feeling also could be explained at times as wanting to launch but not quite doing so.  It was very euphoric.  I tried to keep focus and not have expectations.  This was basically happening during the climb to focus 10 and to the end of the cd.  Visually there were time when  I swore that my visual scape was changing into something different (flashes of something dare I say 3d)... maybe a different focus.. but I didn't want to put thoughts into my head from what I have read, so I will leave it at that and continue.
<br>
<br>
Hope I am in the right direction.
<br>
<br>
Thanx.
<br>

Jeff:

<br>
What you are describing sounds good so far. You sound like you are on the verge of the Monroe focus 12 state. Watch the excitement factor and try to stay emotionally neutral. You are getting to the stage where excitement or fear can start putting a spoke in the works. Not trying to wish it on you obviously and maybe you'll not have a problem at all, but it's something to bear in mind for the coming stages.

<br>
Yours,
