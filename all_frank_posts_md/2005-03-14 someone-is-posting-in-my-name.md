Dear Adrian
<br>
Someone just posted the most horrendous thread in my name with my signature. I had the idea to go in and delete the post but the headline is still there. If it would at all be possible, please let everyone know that the security of the board was breached. I did not post that vile thing. Adrian you know me, at least a bit, I would never post anything like that. I ask that you please clear this up, thanks
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

It would have been easier to find out whom allegedly did this if the post wasn't deleted, and I wasn't aware that one was able to delete a thread that wasn't started by them..

I think he means that someone used his username to pretend to be him while they posted the thread.

Mustardseed, the first thing you should do if you havent done so already is change your password to make sure no-one can log-in as you in the future.

Yeah, I know but he says he deleted it and the title is still there.  If someone else used his name and started this thread, then he shouldn't have been able to delete it...I mean, if anyone on the forums can delete other people's threads..then we are in trouble.

<section>
Well if he logged in using his username the forum would assume that it was him who posted the thread and so he would be able to delete it I suppose. So if two different people logged into the same account the forum would still assume that it is the same person.

alexd, I think Adrian said it was near impossible for this to happen.  But on the safe side, I will PM him and give him this link and have him look into it.

Too late cant change my password, someone allready did. In a way it is quite a interesting thing still. So everybody.....you will now have to figure out who is me.ha I have a few people who know me on the board. At least I think so. they should know. I just wonder if it has any effects on my personal computer life. Any ideas would be appreciated. Just for the record ....anything posted in my name from now should me taken with a grain of salt.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Adrian can reset the password for you. If there is a problem then we'll have it sorted out fairly quickly for you. Can't do anything at the moment as it's an Admin task, and in Adrian's timezone it's about 2.15am.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

And how could the real MS log in to say that his password has been changed if he now doesn't know his password?

Just to explain , I never log out on my home computer. It is on AP 24/7, and yes telos I did go out yesterday and made a post from another machine, but somehow I don't think it is that as it sounded like someone from this site. The lingo and also the very fluent English I do not live in a English speaking country,

alexd: One would need to know the old password when you make a new password for security purposes.
<br>
<br>
And MS, you aren't logged on now or you have it so that your online status is hidden. Either way, we can't tell one way or the other.
<br>
<br>
Only way that the admins would be able to tell is to match the ip's from before this started, but if you've got a dynamic ip, then it'd change, so then that idea wouldn't work. But, like you said, you never log off your computer, so the ip in the last post of yours should match to one from a while back.

<section>
Ok -lines- you are correct but I do not understand how he is logged in now without knowing the old password. If someone else logged into the account it would have "kicked" the user that was already logged in.
<br>
<br>
The only explanation I can see is something like Telos suggested (in the other thread). Unless you have given your password out to someone intentionally or by accident.
<br>
<br>
The only thing you can really do now though is wait until the admin resets your password.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck
<br>

This is not so. I just went to the public computer where I was sad to say still logged in, and naturally logged out. When I came home I was still logged on. I must have been on 2 computers at the same time? How does that work. Anyway I imagine someone entered a post in my name on the public computer. My mistake, I am trying to change the settings.

Question: If someone already changed your password, how are you still able to post?

Ha I will tell you if you promise not to laugh.....Promise? When I came back after having closed the log in on the public computer that still was open, I was tried to change the password on this one, however somehow I had gotten it wrong one and could not reset it, and assumed someone else had done so. For a day I looked for the scrap paper I had written it down on, I only had it as the black dots on the log in, being remembered by the computer. I wrote Adrian and Frank was all paranoid ha. Finally I found it under my desk ahem...and it still did not work, then I realized I had caps on
<img alt=":oops:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/embarrassed.png" title="embarassed"/>
. so finally it worked and I changed it on this site and the email it referred to. What a confusion. Anyway I sure learned a good lesson and now I have it in my notebook right here.........hmm where IS my notebook by the way....well I will find it another time. Note to self, you forget passwords quickly, write them down and use a bigger notebook.
