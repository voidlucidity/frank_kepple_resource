<section>
Hello all, a co-worker of mine suggested this site and here I am.  I've been interested in spiritual work for many years, and actually learned and practised transcedental meditation in high school... way way back that is!  I have many interests in spiritituality and healing, and try to learn about some, and workshops in others.
<br>
<br>
I haven't followed meditation for years, but probably should get back into it. I developed some very serious health problems last summer and apparently it is important to work on stress management for myself. I have fallen out of meditation long ago, and should be making consious effort here to get back into it. It would be nice to rejuvinate the spirit and whatnot.
<br>
<br>
I mildly practise yoga, pilates and try to follow my 'inner guide' in situations.  One of the reasons I decided to check out this website is for personal healing and getting 'back on track' with life. If that makes any sense! lol

I hope to find some exciting and fruitful information and conversations here! Thanks.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,

Welcome to the Astral Pulse Dar!
<br>
<br>
Hopefully you will be inspired after spending some time on the forums getting back to what you dropped some time ago.  Meditation will help with that stress.

Thank you Nay,
<br>
<br>
I have been surfing through the forums and there is quite a bit of interesting information out there, for sure. I am positive this will be a good place to 'hang out' and post my queries , (as wacko as they will probably sound, lol), and wierd experiences.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and cheers,
<br>
