http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_clown.gif" border=0&gt;  whhen i was a few years younger 14-17 im 22 now but in those ages i did alot of expieriments with drugs . I prefered hallucinagins like acid (lsd) mushrooms etc.. i think the reason i liked those was the complete ability for those type of drugs to put me in a world that really wasn't here on earth.
<br>
<br>
I can remember on some of my stronger trips to be out of touch with reality im wondering whether the spirit world could resemble anything like the fluid hallucinations one expieriences when on an ethogen. I know that lucid dreaming can produce some very wild colors and effects like when a person is hallucinating because your mind is doing the creating.
<br>
<br>
I think I remember reading that on lsd your right and left hemispheres of your brain cross producing the hallucinations , in lucid dreaming your eyes are closed so there is no extra sensory information being given to the brain to work with so your brain creates the world maybe thats right?
<br>
<br>
well anyways im wondering if any expierienced obe/ lucid dreamers have an opinion on the similarities if any.

G'Day/Night, whatever it might be whenever you're reading this post.

Just wanted to say hi to you, nclkwrk and thank you for providing your view and information in regards to what you once chose to do and what happened while you were doing those things. I think that it truly would be a very interesting subject to do some extensive research on to see if there actually would be a difference or not to a person who does drugs versus a person who doesn't! What an intriguing idea! I wish that I could provide you with some information on this, but I've never done those things before and only rely on natural talent...
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes to You, and thanks again for your info. That was pretty neat to learn about on your point of view. Hope that you might try it naturally sometime to see if there might be a difference. You could really have something quite fascinating to inform others about on here if you would! Not to lecture you or anything, or anyone else who might be reading this post, but it would be best to do things a more 'natural' way other than using drugs for anything in our own physical world. For example, women try to give birth without using drugs because it's better for their baby and so forth. I also don't wish to offend you or anyone, but this is just how I feel. ~

Hi nclkwrk,
<br>
funny you should start a thread on drugs and the spirit world, because just yesterday I had a good experience with that ....
<br>
I bought an ounce of calea zacatechichi (dream herb) some time ago, and while it hasn't increased my dream recall or lucidity, smoking it gave me a light, marijuana-like high (legal &amp; no paranoia!).
<br>
The only problem was that when smoking outside in the dark at night got me somewhat afraid - so yesterday at night I lighted up a calea-joint and called upon the calea z. - spirit. Funny thing is, I had a great conversation with the spirit, where I told him I'd be more respectful towards the herb in the future and I asked hime to give me sound sleep and some funky dreams that night.
<br>
Well I might just have been talking with my subconscious mind, but the conversation got me very mellow and made all my previous fears go away.
<br>
I think making peace with the spirit of the drug/plant you are using helps a lot in creating peace of mind and a good ... 'trip'.
<br>
I'll see what the hawaiian baby woodrose - spirit has in store for me, next

From what ive read,On drugs you dont have as  much,if any  control.They override all the fear barriers.This can lead to a very bad experience.If you have alot of emotional baggage you carry around.Whether you are ready or
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///not.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 not.You
</a>
just might end up in a place that is in tune to your energy.
<br>
<br>
I do not think it would be much
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///diff.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

to what you experience.But it may be alot harder to keep your emotions in check.

I suggest you do a search on "mushrooms" and see what comes up.  "Mushrooms and OBE" had my post on this subject.  My opinions have not changed!!!!!!!!

The people who take these drugs come back and usually describe some weird experience, like they were "out there" somewhere. Yes, they no doubt were. But the very fact they could not make any sense of it all

 at the time

is where the "drugs shortcut" falls flat on its face.

The most interesting hallucinagen seems to be DMT cause the trips of different people have some degree of similarity of the beings they encounter and the states they experience.The only astral like exp. i had on acid brought me to a place that was full of swirling rainbow lights, years later I saw a tanka of a rainbow body diety and realized that i probably went to the realm pictured.Unfortunately I probably did not have the energy for that realm cause I fell asleep soon after getting there. However the long term use of meditation and energy cultivation is far superior to drugs and can take you to just as far out places.

Every....oh, about three weeks or so someone comes on here and starts talking about drugs and the "spirit world".  Let me just say this: there is a connection between the two, but it's not worth pursuing and will only lead to confusion and difficulty.  That's all there really is to say.  I don't mean to say that it's not worth talking about....I just think if you get into that stuff I guess you will have to come to this conclusion yourself, and you will...eventually.  If not you will become a "burn out" and will perpetually have little or no energy to naturally come upon.

Hi, all.
<br>
<br>
I have to agree that drugs will not give you the long term results. I have posted on this subject before, of a different mindset, but things have happened that have changed my mind. I really do not care to elaborate on them. Yes, you can do more for a while with them than you can if you are untrained. But eventually it turns on you. Someone (I do not remember who) brought up that they "erode", or "rot" the soul so to speak. I would have to agree with that. And I come from the classic USA west coast "hippie" childhood/backround. They were very socially (if not legally) accepted with the greater majority of people I socialized with.
<br>
<br>
With proper training you can accomplish much more, and keep focused on whata you want to achieve. I think the biggest "benefit" of them is it allows you to "bootstrap" past the proper relaxation point. The problem is you never learn how to accomplish this under normal conscious. They may be a time and a place to use them, but I see none in my future. Just be careful people, and do not start the spiral in the wrong direction.

tripping is what brought me here. everytime i would trip i would end up seeing one of the tube like structures that are described in ad and would flip out at how incredible it was to be flying through a tunnel w/ musicl notes coming through. after a while i wanted to get here naturally and i went to the bookstore, happened to pick up ad, and flipped right to the page describing the structure. i haven't tripped since then and i don't think i plan on it. i do remember a few times having some bad experiences while tripping. they werent horrible but i could see how they would be. there is just something about doing it naturally that makes it seem more real and meaningful.
<br>
<br>
but, if you are going to keep tripping.. have fun.. that excrement is crazy fun when everything is right. i had some of the best times of my life tripping w/ friends. it changed my life.

I've done alot of experimenting with the two, and I think it pretty much boils down to this:
<br>
<br>
Drugs remove physical buffers but because of their effect on your mind what you see will be really really strange and bizarre.

 If you can do it without drugs, then why use them???
</b>
<br>
<br>
Also, for myself, I would prefer to be straight doing it, so I wil know what is real and what is not... what is drug induced and what is not...
<br>
<br>
Our minds are a very important part of us...  I certainly would hate to take a chance of not coming back from somewhere that wasn't real...
<br>
<br>
Besides that, how would you know you were actually astral projecting and not just tripping out??  How would you honestly know that if you were high??How could you teach someone to astral project if yours was based on experiences produced from an altered state?  You couldn't because you honestly couldn't say if they were real or not?  They might seem real, but how could you KNOW for sure??
<br>
<br>
I say straight would have to better...  Good clean brain cells with an alert mind ready to accept "come what may"..
