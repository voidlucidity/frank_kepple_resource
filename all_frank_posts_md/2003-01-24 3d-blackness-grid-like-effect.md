With my most recent experement with the 3D blackness effect I fell asleep but later woke to find my field of vision (black) had taken on the 3D effect but this time was diferent. The blackness had a texture of sorts in that it appeared to be a kind of grid-like effect, that's the only way i can describe it.. well, nothing else happened, but has anyone else seen anything like this effect before?

Yes, this is common. People tend to apply different descriptions. Like Bruce Moen, for instance, who talks of a "velvety blackness". I came across that too only I call it a watery blackness. There are a number of textures and effects you can perceive. A common one with me is where the blackness goes a little gray and it developes a fine gravel-like texture that is similar to Artex paint.
<br>
<br>
The important thing is you perceived a kind of 3D effect. What you need to try now, is do it again. Only this time you know what the effect looks like so you can "reach out" for it in your mind. It's like I was saying before in answer to your point about not knowing what you are looking for. Well, now you have something.
<br>
<br>
Something else which may help:
<br>
<br>
The thought came to me the other day that maybe some people set-off down the Phasing route and in some way they think they have to
<i>
 create
</i>
the effects. I mean effects like the 3D Blackness stage, for example. Perhaps they may be confusing it with traditional obe teaching where a person uses some kind of "exit technique" like picturing themselves climbing an imaginary rope, for example. The idea came to mind that maybe people were lying there trying to "picture" a kind of 3-dimensional blackness.
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that you are, particularly. But I just thought that people might have that tendency generally. The 3D blackness is already there, within each of us. What we have to do is mentally reach within and focus on it. It's not something we create, it's something we focus on. This naturally begs the question of where, in the mind, do we focus. Which is a tricky question to answer. But looking at it in Physical terms, I would say it's upwards and back slightly.
<br>
<br>
Imagine looking out horizontaly from your physical eyes. Then shut your eyes so you are now viewing the backs of your eyelids. That's the 2D blackness. Now turn your mental focus through about 100 degrees up from the horizontal. In other words you have shifted so you are now looking within the mind just beyond vertical.

Thanks for the info Frank. Actually, I have been gettting the 3D effect quite often but it tends to occur if I wake during the night.
<br>
I agree that its not something we create but rather something that already exists but which we have to focus on. I feel that the 3d blackness is part astral/part mind in some way - the bridge or point at which your mind meets the astral. Its always there but the trick is finding it!
<br>
<br>
I'm a glutton for punishment so I'll be going back for more!

 I have some questions on this: when I'm viewing the backs of my eyelids....what distance shoudl I be focusing at? Like, if I try to focus on the backs of my eylids, I'm really straining my eyes. If I pretend my eyelids are 50 miles away, that's a whole different thing. I get caught up in "what do you mean by that" kind of questions and get stuck. I have never seen 3D blackness that I am aware of; I seem to be limited to only hypno- and pompo- gogic and dream states, for the vast majority of the experiences I have, with conscious intent delivering zero results.

Maya: I kinda get where you are coming from but my question is, why are you trying to focus on a point at the back of your eyelids? Although I understand what you are literally saying, I'm not at all sure what you are trying to achieve.
<br>
<br>
Also, where you say,
<i>
 "I get caught up in "what do you mean by that" kind of questions and get stuck.
</i>
could you expand a little more for me please. It's just that you mentioned on your other post about trying the TMI tapes for 20 years with no results. While I take my hat off to you for sticking with it for so long; I cannot help but think you are making some basic error without you realising it, that keeps tripping you up from the start.

I also agree that the blackness is not something that can be created, but rather something that happens. Frank's description of focussing upwards and back slightly seems appropriate as each time I've experienced this, I've been lying in bed and get the feeling I'm starting to fall backwards.
<br>
<br>
Maya, if it's of any help,
<br>
when I am actually able to slip into this 3D blackness (doesn't happen often), I tend to start out ignoring my physical eyes. It feels like I'm looking through eyes inside my brain, roughly centre &amp; towards the top.
<br>
<br>
As to appearence, I've had either grey/black, like I'm inside some enormous cargo container, or black with what seem like rows of very small, just on the edge of your vision points of light.
<br>
<br>
James.

The topic of "3D blackness" interests me immensely since I find myself able to perceive it with incredible ease.  Except that it's a "3D grainy greyness."  I've done a lot of work with vision therapy (eye exercises, etc.) and have very poor vision.  As I go into my relaxtion state (generally using the Monroe Institute focus levels since they work so well), I feel my physical eyes "working."  Something you learn in vision therapy is that the physical eye is easily tricked.  (Something you also learn in advertising!)  If you picture a scene at a distance (a ship crossing the horizon, say), the eye muscles relax as if you were actually looking at a distance.  Imaginatively pick up something and look at it close up (a seashell, say) and the eye muscles contract.  So you will indeed (in answer to Maya) get a different "feel" depending on where you are fixing your focus.  The state of tension, tiredness, etc., of the physical eyes will also affect this.  A deeper, richer blackness can be achieved by doing simple physical vision relaxing exercises before beginning meditation.
<br>
<br>
Of course, what
<i>
 we
</i>
are trying to do is to see "nonphysically."  However, in my experience, as I am going into a relaxation/trance state, the physical aspects of vision are very prominent at first, and I try to learn to use them.  I may do some physical vision relaxing exercises before beginning meditation work.  If I sense physical eye tension, I will "look" at a distance (with closed eyes) to relax.
<br>
<br>
I've discovered a new "technique" to become aware of the 3D blackness.  It's there ~ we just need to learn to become aware of it.  Have you ever seen the wonderful film footage of Pablo Picasso painting on glass with white paint?  Marvelous, effortless movement, free flowing designs.  I relax into as much "blackness" as I can get.  Then I imagine an invisible wall of glass at a comfortable distance.  (Wonderful! Imagining something invisible!)  Then I imagine someone painting scribbles across the wall of glass.  No images, pictures, etc. ~ just scribbles.  It's very relaxing, of course.  But you also begin to get the sense of "in front of the glass," "the glass with scribbles," and "behind the glass" because you can see them all.  YOu have a sense of depth and 3-dimensionality.  I then mentally and visually remove the glass and the scribbles and find myself in a 3D black "space."  This takes only a minute or so.  If anyone else tries the technique, I'd love to know how it goes.
