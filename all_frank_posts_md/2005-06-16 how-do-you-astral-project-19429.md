If anyone would like to post on how they start to astral project and share their ideas this is the place to do it... even though i haven't been able to actually project i would like to read how the rest of you fellow projectors do!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I have placed a number of posts in the FAQ section as well as my replies to posts generally. I realise that my Phasing Approach is one of many but if what I say strikes a responsive chord and you have any further questions then I will do my best to answer.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
