<section>
Hello!
<br>
I'm a new user although i am a fanatic reader of this forum.
<br>
<br>
I decided to post this thread ,because tonight i heard something really strange.
<br>
I was watching a tv show about astral projection and one of the "guests"
<br>
claimed that he and his scientific team did an experiment.
<br>
<br>
They wanted to "extract" the soul from the physical body...
<br>
<br>
Now...
<br>
That guy claims that since last week he lives ...without his soul!
<br>
He also says that his "soul" will return after four weeks.
<br>
<br>
The same man takes one step further and says two more things.
<br>
1)That a soul can live outside the body from a period of 2 to 8 weeks...
<br>
2)That we can substitute the soul of a body with another one...
<br>
<br>
When he was asked "how he feels without a soul",he answered that
<br>
he feels very relaxed,like being in a "nirvana".
<br>
He also said that he can fall asleep whenever he decides...
<br>
<br>
I don't know any other details about the nature of the experiment,or other aspects of this subject.
<br>
<br>
The show was about astral projection,so the host didn't insist on that particular theme.
<br>
<br>
However,i'd really love to read your opinions.
<br>
Has anyone of you ever heard/read something similar?

This makes sense and no sense. If true, it would mean that another soul has taken his souls place, in which case he wouldn't still be answering the questions as himself.
<br>
<br>
I suppose it's possible, but it sounds kinda like possession. I wonder what will happen when he tries to get back after 4 weeks, and I wonder if he will commit any crimes before he gets back. If it's true that is.
<br>
<br>
The only possibility I see that would make sense from my limited knowledge would be some kind of detachment where you still leave part of you in your body but you go astral project with another aspect of yourself without returning for a while.
<br>
<br>
It seems to me like he discovered the mind split effect and completely misunderstood it.

The "being in a nirvana" probably comes from the placebo effect. If they did extract the soul from his body, he wouldn't be there to talk about it.

Hello again.
<br>
<br>
He said that "consciousness"
<br>
and soul are two different things.
<br>
<br>
People on the show,said exactly what you said.That he shouldn't be able to "act" if he had no soul...
<br>
<br>
However,he started talking about electromagnetic fields around the body Â and things like that.
<br>
<br>
To say the truth,i understood nothing.
<br>
<br>
I wish they gave him more time to explain "his theory".
<br>
<br>
Personally,i always connected "consciousness" with "soul"...
<br>
That's why the whole story sounds so strange to me.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
They were probably just drunk or high on drugs, or they simply had no idea of what they were talking about, or more likely a combination of all three.

I thought we should be open-minded.

You can have all sorts of experiences in F2 that could lead you to believe this, and he probably just took something the wrong way.

This story reminds me of the time I was in the hospital with an asthma attack. To prevent me from ever having another asthma attack the doctor removed my lungs. It is amazing how wonderful it feels to breath without lungs and the best is I will never have another attack.

Without lungs? Interesting dream, but asthma is not a problem in lungs, and instead of doing such thing they would just give you some strong anti-asthma drugs(they can stop the attack in a few seconds).

I've always entertained the idea that soul is never inside one's body. It sits far away in some higher dimensions and simply controls the body and experiences through the body.
<br>
Once the body is too weak to continue, it simply junks it and finds a new one. The body is a device to act in this physical world, but is capable of some independent existence. Like, it will not disappear or die if the soul is not connected to it for some time (like in sleep and unconsciousness).
<br>
The body 'dies' not because the soul decides to leave it, but because in physical entropy rules and things grow old and wear n tear with time. So the soul is never here to start with. Its not meaningful to talk of you and your soul seperately, because they are same thing, however you and your body may not be same.
<br>
<br>
Now for his claim, I guess he is talking about the feeling of bliss some people get when they spend a lot of waking time partially in astral and feel disconnected here. After a few oobes you feel calm and quiet for some days and this world doesn't bother you that much. Perhaps this is what he is calling 'living without a soul'.

I resent that stereotypical remark, but the third explanation makes sense.
