G' day all. I love how Robert greets people! Anyway, are any of you feelin' a tad bit left out, possibly because you've been trying to find a place where you could talk to other advanced projectors at? Maybe we could gather here a bit and talk to each other, maybe even come up with some kewl astral experiements too. We could also discuss some of the popular problems even the advanced projectors might run into as well and how some of you've come up with ways to get around these projecting problems.
<br>
<br>
Novice and Intermediate projectors of course, are welcome to talk to us here too. Maybe we could help them out in answering some of their popular questions, such as about why one could get sleep paralysis and the such.
<br>
<br>
Well, do start gatherin' here a bit and talkin' away! I hope this cute little corner might make some of you feel more at home! ~

Hello again all. I wanted to ask a quick question here...How many of you have a problem trying to project to a specific person or place and wind up being/going somewhere else or to someone else?
<br>
<br>
Last night I tried projecting out to go to someone and wound up seeing a family of people including their young girl who were all sitting on a couch together. For some odd reason, they appeared to have seen me viewing them while they were sitting on their couch! I must've wound up in the astral instead of the physical while astral projecting instead...sigh...

<section>
G' day all. I'd just like to say a few things here to some of you who might actually be reading a few of my posts, whether you're an advanced projector or otherwise. We all have the capability to become advanced projectors someday. Don't give up hope and keep trying, ~seriously~ ! If one gives up, they'll never be able to find out that they could do whatever it was they were trying to do! No matter what one may try to accomplish doing in their life, even if it might be trying to astral project, don't just ever give up. In order to make anything happen in our physical world, one must at least try doing it for it to come into being.
<br>
<br>
Believe me, astral projecting's well worth your time and efforts! I admit here, that even I have trouble projecting, especially when asked to project to a very ~specific~ person or place. Sometimes I really have wonderful and fascinating projections and other times, I intend on having one and don't even remember having one at all or know if one even ever had taken place or not.
<br>
<br>
So, astral projecting does somewhat take a ~very~ disciplined and focused mind that one must train themself to find a way to continue to keep their physical mind awake and aware while one's projecting to remember having a projection at the exact same time you're in the process of having one. I believe Robert's called this memory downloading or astral feedback, (?) or something along those lines. My physical memory's not that good right now...go figure...
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
Remembering and making a connection with one's physical mind with their astral body's mind is one of the best ways to realize you've had a projection. One of the greatest things you have to look forward to while astral projecting's flying. Yes, I said flying. I once heard someone long ago tell me that if one's flying, then this might be a great indicator that you're really out of your body. Since I had started to astral project, flying has always been one of the greatest joys while astral projecting, and it sure is 100 times better than riding any roller coaster I've ever been on too, as there are really absolutly ~no~ limitations and you can go any which way you desire, without the physical restraints that roller coasters have, as you have to fasten yourself up in them in the physical.
<br>
<br>
That's all for now. I hope at least a few of you on here might find some of this information beneficial. Good luck and happy astral projectings to you too!

nice thread, too bad noone has commented on their experiences yet. Like you I get out there and fly fly fly, most of the time. I have had people ask me to take them with me when I astral travel, I have on some occassions, but they are usually too spaced out to do anything constructive, they just don't have the conscious ability or experience. So I limit my experiences to my own, and only seek others if they drop in on me when i am already on the astral plane.
<br>
<br>
As for going to specific places and people, that sure is hit and miss, so I agree with your comment that it is not so easy to do specifics.
<br>
<br>
I would be interested in hearing from others

G'day/night there! Thanks for your reply. What an interesting profile ya have there too! Yes, indeed flying's one of the most fun things to do while projecting! (*smile*)
<br>
<br>
I've been asked a few times to help people out to exit and project out of their body's, but I can't quite figure out how to project myself to the right person or place to get them! I always just wind up projecting to someone or somewhere else instead. That's a bit annoying...I've been offered to project with other projector's who've projected and offered me to go with them a few rare times before and think that's just the neatest thing!
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
Thanks to them, I've been able to go with them to pretty neat places, such as a temple and so on.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd love to hear more about the interest ya have in your profile, especially Tai Chi and the Jungian psychotherapy. I like making mandala like art, as mandalas can be made to induce healing for not only oneself, but for others who they're made specifically for too.
<br>
<br>
Can't wait to hear from you! I normally check into the chat room if you'd like to talk to me live as well pretty much every night, Central American Time. ~

Hello all. (*Warm smile*) Just wanted to share a great astral vision/sight technique with you that I may have already mentioned in one place or the other before. Right before you fall asleep at night, say this either out loud or in your mind to have an extraordinarily great experience:
<br>
<br>
~ I will recall and remember all of my: astral projections, astral sight visions, lucid dreams and obe experiences clearly and in great detail. I will see all places, people, objects and beings how they truly are and not in their false form. ~
<br>
<br>
I tried saying this in my mind the other night (Wednesday 9-5-02) and as I was lying there seeing who/what I could as well as experience whatever I could, I can remember this one thing the most. I saw a handsome man and I believe what was his pet chiwawa dog that was sitting very close by me on my right pillow! I believe that the man might've been showing me his chiwawa astrally for some reason. I also believe that this dog was wearing a colar of sorts too. This was so realistic, I actually had to wake all the way up to see if the man and dog were really in my bedroom visiting me or not in the physical! How amazingly real this experience was! Truly unbelievable! Too bad I can never seem to figure out who this man really is though........oh well...maybe someday I will, especially if he ever decides to show me on a piece of paper, astrally what his name is... (*wink and a 'lil smile*)

G'day/night all. (*smile*) I have a quick question for some of you here. How many of you've been seeing the same person over many different times during your astral projections? You may or may not actually know this person who exists in the physical, yet this person has been seen by you a lot of times and feel that he/she's familar to you in some way and feel that you for some reason know this person too. I'd be interested to hear how many of you here have experienced this sort of thing before... ~

Hey BLM,i havent been able to reach anybody ive met in the astral more than once and I will keep trying,but heres a cool real time obe that I had.i projected out of my body and went thru the floor to the kitchen on 1st floor.everything was incredibly clear,vivid and true to life(no reality fluctuations).mundane objects shone with a beauty from within.I looked out the window and saw the sun low on the horizon(early morn.) with a few clouds as well.I decided to fly into space so I flew thru the window into the sky.within a matter of approx. 10 seconds I was beyond the earths atmosphere.the darkness increased as I left the earths atmosphere behind.I decided to see how fast I could travel without doing the instantaneous projection technique and ending up somewhere in the astral dimensions.I noticed I there were more stars to my upper left ,so I changed direction,and flew at an amazing speed to what I figured out afterwards on star charts was towards the centre of our galaxy.I wasnt getting any closer to the stars despite the speed I was travelling,and I started to worry about going to far,so I was pulled back to my body.I fell into normal sleep and had a dream that was almost like my brain was trying to "interpret" the experience.metaphorical imagery obviously based on the obe.I woke up elated with a full memory of the experience.I went downstairs to the kitchen window and the same style of clouds,and the morning sun was low on the horizon. pretty cool eh?!

I just want to talk about a very pleasing oobe I had a few weeks ago.
<br>
I learned to project about a year ago, avrage 1 AP a week, anyway ...
<br>
<br>
I was watching TV, about black holes, I decide to go and see one.
<br>
I am a little conserened that even an astral body would get stuck in a black hole, but I went knowing that I could make more astral bodys, lose a little info at the most. I project, get out of my house and into space. to the black hole in the center of our miliky way.  I didnt recall all of the oobe untill a few days ago. I can not even describe the great beauty.  golden dots of light from atoms being sucked in, not so many close up, but in the distance you could see horizon after horizon of increasingly more golden dots, with a black backgrond. like waves of gold flakes on  a black velvet sea.  A dvd could do it justest, not words.
<br>
I wish I could paint like the greatest artist, to put this so all could see.
<br>
calm, quiet, and gold light like a forest with christmas trees,all lit up, streaching into the distance untill the lights merge into a glow.
<br>
<br>
...plus I just learned to project awake and unrelaxed today, very very cool.

~ G'Day/Night to you Jason. Nice to hear from you. ~
<br>
<br>
"Hey BLM,i havent been able to reach anybody ive met in the astral more than once and I will keep trying,...". Jason's quote.
<br>
<br>
Many times I've been told by someone very wise that all of us at one time or the other visit others as well as others visit us while we're sleeping over the course of the night. The problem is, is that many people don't remember doing this as well as don't realize they're being visited! The visits could be from people who we once loved and who have passed on to the other side, our spirit guides, other people who astral project to us and so on.....
<br>
<br>
"...but heres a cool real time obe that I had.i projected out of my body and went thru the floor to the kitchen on 1st floor.everything was incredibly clear,vivid and true to life(no reality fluctuations).mundane objects shone with a beauty from within."
<br>
<br>
It's very intriguing that you chose to tell me about this particular obe experience that you've had, because I've also experienced the projecting into the kitchen one before and it was also very incredibly realistic and easy to see without those pesky reality fluctuations!
<br>
<br>
My obe basically occured sometime during the morning and I pretty much suddenly found myself standing up and looking down at my feet and it wasn't coming in too clear and forced myself to make it come in clearer! I also wasn't looking at my astral body from my physical body's mind either and was actually my astral body! I believe that everything wasn't as clear though because I was still a little connected to my physical body and was still in the process of adjusting to being projected out. I just continued to keep looking down at the carpet while my astral body was walking at the same time. I was going toward the kitchen downstairs. I believe that my mother was standing in the kitchen too near by the counter. She appeared very clear and must've been sharing this experience with me! I later on asked her about it but she unfortunatly didn't remember this. Go darn figure...
<br>
<br>
"I looked out the window and saw the sun low on the horizon(early morn.) with a few clouds as well.I decided to fly into space so I flew thru the window into the sky." Jason's quotes.
<br>
<br>
Projecting through the window eh? I've also done this lots of times before. Someone once told me that whenever one does this, they're really out of their body. (*smile*)
<br>
<br>
"...within a matter of approx. 10 seconds I was beyond the earths atmosphere." Jason's quote.
<br>
<br>
Within only 10 seconds? Really? You're so lucky! I normally have been unable to project off of Earth's atmosphere because if I try to, I've run into very frightening, thick, black power line looking objects that always seem to appear to scare and therefore prevent me from leaving! I believe Robert's said that this could be an indicator that a person might have an astral spider attachment.......I did actually find one once, and before I read that in Robert's book too! I've been flying for the past few months and haven't run into the black power line thingy's, so I'm probably clear of the astral spider I've found and rid myself of now. (*smile*)
<br>
<br>
"...the darkness increased as I left the earths atmosphere behind.I decided to see how fast I could travel without doing the instantaneous projection technique and ending up somewhere in the astral dimensions.I noticed I there were more stars to my upper left ,so I changed direction,and flew at an amazing speed to what I figured out afterwards on star charts was towards the centre of our galaxy.I wasnt getting any closer to the stars despite the speed I was travelling,and I started to worry about going to far,so I was pulled back to my body.I fell into normal sleep and had a dream that was almost like my brain was trying to "interpret" the experience.metaphorical imagery obviously based on the obe.I woke up elated with a full memory of the experience.I went downstairs to the kitchen window and the same style of clouds,and the morning sun was low on the horizon. pretty cool eh?!" Quoted by Jason.
<br>
<br>
Isn't it just 'so' very wonderful flying into space (astrally of course) ? It's absolute freedom! No need for a clammy spacesuit with limitedness in being able to move about or anything, just pure fun and enjoyment! We're not even freezing cold either, as how it is in the physical I've heard others say which is yet another reason why spacesuits are so insulated...I'm so happy to hear that you've also experienced doing this as well. And yes, your experience was really kewl, thank you very much for sharing it with me too! ~
<br>
<br>
May you have many more wonderful and fun experiences! ~

<br>
<br>
You were able to project to a black hole? Amazing! Several years ago, I use to almost run into strange and frightening things that looked like gigantic swirling tornados in space! They made a slight electrical or electricity humming sound, more like a snapping cackling noise. They would spin in a constant and steady swirling motion and looked like immense and suspended black energy. They were close by the Earth too. I have no idea what they were, but felt very uncomfortable whenever my astral body would project and see them near by! All I knew was to stay the hey away from them for an obvious reason, which was the black swirling energy things would've harmed my astral body. I also got a fearful feeling from these as well at the time too. I believe that this was as close as it was to me ever getting to see a black hole before while projecting...
<br>
<br>
Well, there was also this one other time I had seen a constant swirling multi-colored thing in an antique looking room where an instructor appeared to be lecturing a class of adults I projected to once a few months ago. Maybe it was a black hole or a worm hole, but basically, I wonder if there's even a difference between the two anyway? I bet black holes and worm holes are nothing more than a type of portal that one could use to quickly make whoever goes into them travel to another location in space... (*smile*)
<br>
<br>
Sorry, I kind of rambled on again. Anyway, you said that yours had golden dots? Well, that's really neat then! Do you have any idea what those golden dots might've been that you've seen? I believe that since there is no true empty space anywhere, (because all space is filled by atoms and molecules and probably even smaller things) what you were seeing was some kind of energy particle which probably exists within black holes. They probably produce their own energy. Well, I'm sure something has to be making a black hole constantly be in motion, so what else would it be other than energy particles of sort? Right? Just thought that I'd mention that to you.
<br>
<br>
Well, thanks again for sharing your space experience with me. I love seeing that others have also had this kind as well. Happy astral traveling and exploring! ~ (*smile*)

<br>
seems like the power lines attract us, like a magnet. I would fly within 10 feet of them, and get stuck, force my way through, and then up. God ... isnt it great to look down from a thousand feet while floating? IT just gives me a surge of joy and pleasure to be up there ,free, truely free.

<br>
<br>
I was above the event horizon (thats the right name, I think) of the black hole.
<br>
below me was black, I saw a very few (like 3) golden dots below me, they were atoms being sucked into the hole. as they were excited, or speeding up, they would shine . I could not see them inside the hole, but around it, above the horizon. Below me were a few, in frunt of me they were spaced out, and not too many, only a few hundred. beyond the ones infrunt of me, less than a thousand miles, they appered more close together, thats just becouse I was looking at more of them in the same space. beyond them, even more, more golden light than darkness. beyond that they almost touch. and beyond that, like a 1/4 of an A.U. , they were a constant light.
<br>
golden up close,   and gold with  gold + a red tent farther off.
<br>
It was swerling counter clockwise very slowly. I estmate it at a 1/2 A.U. around, and its entrails going out (or comeing from) about 3/4 og an A.U. .
<br>
An A.U. is a meserment of distance. 1 A.U. is the distance between the earth and our sun.
<br>
when I fly really fast and try to stop, I can feel inerta in my astral body, but I flet no pull from this black hole.  I didnt even think of entering it, I will try that some time.
<br>
We should try to project together sometime, meet up and play.
<br>
I have helped people project (my mom) while in astral form.
<br>
Its sooo fun to project, can you imanage doing it with friends?
<br>
we would need to go to the same place ...

False awakeings. When I first started  to project, I would often (not as many now) have F.A. s, sometimes as many as 20 . I used to want to see if anyone wanted to switch bodys, just to see if we could do it. Twice I woke up in another persons body, they were trying to project, it would be only a few seconds and I could see the room they were in , not mine by a long shot.
<br>
the longest dream I have ever had was one that seemed to last two hours, and it was lucid.  I projected once, came beck to a F.A. of me getting up, two more F.A.s of me getting up, then a wieard experence.
<br>
I woke up in a little boys body, in germany in the 30's or 40's .
<br>
I (he) was with his famaily. I was also trying to remember everything I could, (a projection goal of mine) the goal stuck, but I forgot or didnt know I was projecting. I explored the house, and then played with my siblings. after a long while I got in a truck with my dad and uncle and went somewhere. I remember the trip, the things I saw on the way, the people we talked to. we went there (my dream jornal is about 10 pages of this F.A.) and went back home. hours more of playing inside and out. I went to sleep. woke up  ... in the same body, did things for another day, went to sleep ( it would be a lot to write, a lot of things happened, it was a busy few days for the kid ) woke up again, and mid way through this day I awoke to a F.A. of my (me ,this physical body and ego )house. one or two more F.A.s of this and I was finally awake.
<br>
<br>
The oobe its self was cool to, I flew around my city, and into my aunts home, returnen to my body and then the F.A.s and wieard timetraveling body possissing experence, and more F.A.s
<br>
<br>
about three days, half a day for the sleep, and F.A.s , two and a half days of being someone elese in someother time.  the boy was blond, about 8 years old. and I recorded very many things, very very many things.
<br>
<br>
after this I didnt project with the intent of entering another body.
<br>
I do want to go to the astral "hall of records"  though
<br>
<br>
also worth saying: when I was about six, I had an instance where my ears were ringing, and I knew something was up. years later I recall seeing myself, from 30 feet away, from the sky. I remote viewed myself, or gained a spirits memory of this event, Im not sure. just another odd psychic thing.
<br>
I seen my self, as a 6 year old, from the prospective of the sky (just under tree hight) ... and other times too.
<br>
any idea about this one? this happen to you guys ever?

G'day/night metaphysic. Nice to hear from you again.
<br>
<br>
Yes, those darn power line thingys do seem to really attract us like magnets! That is very true! I reallllyyyy don't like them! Since you said that you ran into them and got stuck before, did they shock you really bad or did anything along those lines happen? Just wondering...because I've never touched or came into contact with them before thank goodness! ~
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing this scientific facts with me, such as this, "...I saw a very few (like 3) golden dots below me, they were atoms being sucked into the hole. as they were excited, or speeding up, they would shine ." metaphysic

It almost reminds me of something an astronomer might say in the way that the beautiful glowing hydrogen gas in space becomes lit up because of the atoms being excited. If mankind could find a way to make this reaction happen on Earth in a contained way, maybe we will have a new way to make light bulbs work and so much more! Just a though... ~

And, thanks for teaching me about this as well, "An A.U. is a meserment of distance. 1 A.U. is the distance between the earth and our sun." metaphysic
<br>
I don't really know that much whenever it comes down to knowing about the math...sigh, so thanks. Besides being an artist, if it wasn't for the math, I would've been a scientist...but one must make a choice what they want to be in this life, one thing or the other...and keep the other a favored hobby... ~

<br>
About you entering into the black hole. I'm sure that would be fine, of course, astrally. (*smile*) One can always enter back into their body if there's trouble mostly because of their silver cord, at least I do sometimes if I am! I wonder how it would be like traveling into a black hole? Would the astral body swirl around uncontrollably or would it not really be effected in that way since it's not physical? Those sure would be worth while questions to try answering and fun too!
<br>
<br>
Well, I don't mean to be a bummer here, but I really have to get some sleep now. I'll have to unfortunatly respond more to your other post a little later on tomorrow night sometime after work. ~

" My gosh, I will be so glad when I can do these things. I have decided to start setting aside a specific time each day and stick to one technique until I am successful. "    (Blossom)
<br>
the hardest part of any projection (for me and a lot of people) is to remember when we get back. when you try , Blossom, do it with the intent of comeing back as soon as you relize you have done it.  and the energy is very imporintant too.
<br>
<br>
so do whatever energy "powering up" thing you have learned, attempt to project (as you are going to sleep or in a trance, or whatever technique  you have learned) , and return as soon as your "out" , it will be a thousand times easier to recall your first few projections.
<br>
<br>
1.power up   2.relax your body 100% (like the instant before you start to dream) 3. do the astral projection technique you intend to use 4. come back as soon as you get free from your body (less than 10 seconds  out)
<br>
<br>
I have just learned this myself, just over a year ago. some nights I would project (and instantly return ) as many as over twenty times.  But I am new to this too, I can only stay out a short time (a minute or so) before I need to return. I could stay out longer, but I get no recall when I do that. I wont even remember the exit.
<br>
<br>
the fastest way, I have learned, is   1. to become 100% relaxed, so you cant move your body anymore  2. place your self in your solar plexus . your prospective will be of being in your core, the middle of your body. 3. exit by willing your self out.
<br>
<br>
flight is just as easy as wanting to "go that way", and your astral self will be "pulled" by your physical body. you must leave the room/house to have any cool effects (sometimes your are blinded when close to body, you cant fly, its extreamly hard to move, and you move love your in glue)
<br>
<br>
when you DO do this, make 100% you are not dreaming when you wake up.
<br>
you will often find thet your in a dream of being awake, everything is normal, and you really cant tell the diffrence unless you do a compleat dream check. I like to read, you will know very soon if your dreaming or not. (writeing in a dream jurnal may also be part of the dream) dreams such as these are you projecting into the astral form of your house, city , or  world.  these are called "False Awakeings" or FAs .
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
the power lines feel like tree sap going through. and in the projections, they would seem to resist me as well, moveing as I forced my way through them.
<br>
and you just seem to fly into them without aiming or intending to, like a tree that jumps in frunt of a drunk driver.
<br>
<br>
as long as were on the astral projection into space talk ...
<br>
I was projecting to a star once, I flew as fast as I could. but I instantly was there, looking at my astral self still flying to the star. my "there" astral self sent something (it looked like pulses of white thought waves) to the "flying" astral self. and both bacame aware of each other, and I returned.
<br>
<br>
I was also projecting one time, I and I could see other astral travelers. hundreds if not thousands of them comeing to earth from another star system. the ones I saw were "E.T.s" and all comeing from the same place.
<br>
they had the spirit form of near humans. I returned.
<br>
<br>
projected into my girlfriends house, I did this a few times when we were together.
<br>
<br>
projected into a dream of my uncle's one time, helped him induce a lucid dream, then left.
<br>
<br>
<br>
got out of body once (22 times this night), and got into the bathroom and looked into the mirror to see my own trancelusent pale face. as soon as I would se it, I would be back in body, and repeat the trip to the bathroom mirror. the 23rd time I was really awake.
<br>
<br>
Flying around in any projection is among the best experences you can have. when it works, your astral voice is awsome, in the sence that when you hear is, you will be awe struck. astral sex ...  havent got to yet.
<br>
jumping off the roof of your house is cool too.
<br>
<br>
the projections are so real, so vivid, that when you do project, you need to do an "awake test" to make sure your not awake. I stop and make sure im really in astral (becouse it is so real) before I bang my head against the window full force and am fliping through the air outside.
<br>
<br>
<br>
!! the one of the easiest ways to astral project ,Blossom , is to creat a lucid dream, or to turn a dream lucid , and just want to project. as soon as you think about astral projection in a lucid dream, your out.
<br>
<br>
" ... I limit my experiences to my own, and only seek others if they drop in on me when i am already on the astral plane."  (astralc)
<br>
<br>
lets start projecting to the same place to see if we can find each other, and get a message through. anyone one, just to confirm we did it , via the net.
<br>
 wouldnt it be cool if we could merge and both gain the knowlege of both of us?  the face on mars would be a good place to meet, or the other ruins up there.      lets do this a few times before we attempt to merege though.
 <br>
  <br>
   and blossom, about thinking your a nut, we all questioned our sanity when the unreal became real, and the unatainable was in our grasp.
   <br>
    when dreams became true experences , and this world became just one of a few that we are all in at the same time.    ...it can be hard to adjust.

When I was younger, about six years ago , I had just learned to remote view and use clairvoyence. The remote viewing was fuzzy, and the color blured at first. the best i could get it was to see a pitcure like I had tears in my eyes. I could see where I wanted to view. the clairvoyence was ok. i could feel an object that I intended to, even feel the texture and tempature inside the objects. but not any more than one object at a time. I was sixteen.
<br>
<br>
about two years ago, I found I could clairvoyently feel a larger area. I could feel about a three foot area at once. I could vivedly feel the surface of, say , a wall . every bump and the slikness of the paint. the inside of the wall, everything. I used the clairvoyence at the same time I ever used psychokinesis. my remote viewing was to the point where I could watch my house, in the prospective of 1/25 . not that I seen it as small, but I could see/feel an area around my house five or six blocks around as well as my place.
<br>
<br>
now I can Astral Project in a trance or dream, experment for about a minute or two before I need to return (to retain memory), and with a very high sucess rate.  I have learned to project awake, unrelaxed to any wanted place/person. however, I can  not move like in a normal projection, this is more like remote viewing. I can jump from place to place in the remote view, but its like my eyes are almost clear. I can see everything like ita comeing from near the conner of my eye. very clear, all in all. my clairvoyence is so well, that I cant sometimes see perefctly with my eyes tightly shut. I can see in the dark, things look like "heat vision" , execpt nearer objects are colored diffrent than farther objects.
<br>
yellow up close , then from shades of yellow to shades of orange-red, to red-orange to red. yellow is two feet, red is nearer to eight to ten feet. everything turns into shades of dark red to red-black after ten about feet.
<br>
<br>
I still only see mostly white in auraic sight, color mostly when people are sick.
<br>
I can change the shape of my aura (in a mirror), and have healed people with  my aura energy before.
<br>
<br>
BLM, lets project together sometime. I have done it before, I want to project and talk about how cool it was with someone who did the same out of body.
<br>
maybe you could remote view  kind-of-project ? it would be a fun exercise.
<br>
...or anyone elese that can &amp; wants to.

<br>
<br>
sure is nice to have a few others here, good thread idea mate. OK, Tai Chi was my awakening, after I had done this for 6 months I began to wake up in my dreams, and was that weird. My experiences led me to experiment in meditation and when teaching others to meditate. I then studied hynotherapy and then eventually psychology.
<br>
<br>
Using trance in therapy is the best way to deal with emotional isues, far more powerful and succesful than any other method.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wanted to tell you about an experience I had a few months ago. A lady rang me about a haunted house she was living in. Her children were spooked, she was and so too were her friends. I agreed to drop in and take a peek though I was not normally consulted to do this sort of thing by any stretch of the imagination.
<br>
<br>
I went and looked around the house and yard with her, she had already left with the kids to live elsewhere. Some very strong earth rays, ley lines crossed her kitchen and bedroom, where most of the things happened. There was an attic where they basically lived, it was locked so I didn't get to look in there. We were scheduled to visit the next night to experience them in the dark, I must have been mad! But she pulled out.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I meditated every night to work and connect astrally with the spooks in the house. I had done this several times before, spontaneously. Each time I got there I was dumped out again back into my body. I got the impression that there were about 9 people / ghosts. And ther was an element of abuse, cigarette burning, arms slashed, ritualistic abuse of some sort. The farm house had been a rental for almost a century, in a farming area away from prying eyes.
<br>
<br>
I went there once and heard a little girl say in my ear, "Hey you!" and then I got a smack on the back of the hand, I came back to my body. I also got pushed back to my body by someone and pinched on the arm too. I was disappointed that I couldn't stay there and tell them to buzz off, they deliberately stayed there despite being aware of their plight.
<br>
<br>
It has now been some months, and I have given up. I have the feeling that I shouldn't be going there, but....

Really, no problem. I try giving some advice whenever I can to others. Any techniques in particular you like using? Remember to be well rested and to try clearing your mind before trying to attempt to astral project as Robert and I agree on he mentioned in his book.
<br>
<br>
And nobody's a nut really. Sometimes it's just difficult to try to understand something another doesn't. And, sometimes one may or may not even really know what they're experiencing either. It could be their imagination, a lucid dream or something really intriguing that one's actually going through...

Hello again metaphysic. (warm smile) ~
<br>
<br>
So, you actually have been able to go through these before huh? I never want to see or especially touch them! They really frighten me for some strange reason...have no idea why, I do have something about getting shocked I guess. Good thing I haven't been seeing them lately for the past few months, maybe it's because I got rid of an astral spider that was lingering on my right astral shoulder? I believe Robert's said that if one sees lines like in this sort of case I guess as I once kept seeing they could be caused by an astral spider...(please correct me if I'm wrong) ~ However, since these strange, thick power lines seemed to emmit some kind of electricity, I don't feel that they necessarily were from the astral spider attachment and must've been something else causing them to appear...or maybe even someone else...who really knows though? ~
<br>
<br>
"the power lines feel like tree sap going through. and in the projections, they would seem to resist me as well, moveing as I forced my way through them.
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Well, that's pretty intriguing, thanks for sharing that. I've never experienced this sort of occurance before though. Maybe your "there" astral self was probably sending light or energy to your other "flying" astral self.  Maybe it needed it or something?
<br>
<br>
Also, I've had my physical mind view my other two astral selves before but have never returned to my physical body even though I've been able to see them looking at as well as interacting with one another. ~
<br>
<br>
"I was also projecting one time, I and I could see other astral travelers. hundreds if not thousands of them comeing to earth from another star system. the ones I saw were "E.T.s" and all comeing from the same place.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Once again I thank you for sharing your experience here with me. It's really neat how you chose to tell me about this particular one, because whenever I was pretty much starting out doing astral projecting, I once remember seeing other astral travelers, in space too! There were hundreds of people maybe thousands of them too that I saw and they mostly were men and women. I saw them outside of the Earth's atmosphere floating and flying above too. I was there as well doing this and who knows what and why we were all doing that all at the same time supposedly...These people looked quite normal unlike the ones you saw though as far as I can remember. They looked very human to me anyway.  Maybe I wasn't looking at them closely enough... ~
<br>
<br>
"projected into my girlfriends house, I did this a few times when we were together." metaphysic
<br>
<br>
That's pretty kewl doing things like that indeed. I've projected in my own home a few times over the year and have told my parents what they were wearing and what they were doing and have actually been able to verify this as being real with them a few times too. That's 'really' neat whenever something like that happens! ~
<br>
<br>
"projected into a dream of my uncle's one time, helped him induce a lucid dream, then left.'' metaphysic
<br>
<br>
I've also projected to other family member's houses before as well. My grandmother's and great grandmothers. They were projecting at the time I was too and was in their home astrally with them. Too bad they never could remember being with me though, so I have no real way of verifying if this was ever real/true or not.....go figure... ~
<br>
<br>
"got out of body once (22 times this night), and got into the bathroom and looked into the mirror to see my own trancelusent pale face. as soon as I would se it, I would be back in body, and repeat the trip to the bathroom mirror. the 23rd time I was really awake." metaphysic
<br>
<br>
Good gollllyyyyy gee! That's a lot of projections! Maybe you're having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep perhaps? (* chucklin' *) Anyway, that's a good way to practice! I've also been able to repeat having an astral projection a few extremely rare times. I basically was in a place and woke up for some reason and then went back to the same place to continue whatever it was I was originally doing before I woke up the first time. ~

<br>
<br>
Yes, flying around is indeed the most fun thing one can do while projecting! And, sometimes whenever I project, it's also fun jumping off of buildings too! There's always tons of fun things to do within the astral. There never seems to be a dull moment while projecting there to me! ~
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes, it's good to somehow find out that one's not really awake indeed before doing something that otherwise might hurt you! (*laughing*) ~

Thanks Astralc. I was hoping that people would be more open to discussing various issues here about astral projecting as well as some new techinques one could stumble upon finding while trying to project. Even if a projector may have a problem that might come up, that would also be a great topic of discussion as well.

<br>
<br>
I've heard that if one wakes up in their dreams, this could lead to one having a lucid dream, if they become 'aware' that they're dreaming. Furthermore, I've also heard that if one controls their dream, this could also actually be an astral projection and not necessarily just a lucid dream... ~

"My experiences led me to experiment in meditation and when teaching others to meditate. I then studied hynotherapy and then eventually psychology." Astralc
<br>
<br>
Tai Chi, would you mind elaborating a little more on what it generally is about here? I've been thinking about taking some classes on this for some time, because of my curiosity in wanting to learn about what it is about. It probably has to do with manipulating the natural energy that exists around oneself... ~
<br>
<br>
So, you've taught others to meditate? That's really neat and kind of you. Could I ask you then one question in regards to it? I normally meditate while sitting in an upright position with my legs crossed. I would like to be able to meditate without my darn head falling down over and over again. Because it does this, I get out of my trance and messes my train of thought up. I still have had successful meditations though, but might you have any suggestions on how to keep one's head from falling down while meditating in an upright sitting position? ~
<br>
<br>
"Using trance in therapy is the best way to deal with emotional isues, far more powerful and succesful than any other method." Astralc
<br>
<br>
Trance in therapy? Is this hypnotherapy maybe? How does one go about doing this? Is this where you make your client enter into a trance state to have them talk to you to see what may be the root of their problem, that's buried and in most cases, hidden in the furtherst corner of their subconscious? ~

<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing your experience with me here. I appreciate it a lot.

Would you mind elaborating a little more on what Earth rays and ley lines are that you had seen?

Ah, a farm place with around 9 people/ghosts/entities. They were probably Earthbound if anything then, especially if there were things that were happening around their house.

It certainly sounds as though these people might be Earthbound. Did you ever consider trying to meditate and ask for assistance to take them into the light, where they really belong?
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
I wonder why they would be Earthbound? Maybe something happened where they had killed themselves in there by doing who knows what and for what reason. Or, maybe they were victims of sort. This doesn't matter as much though as that they need to be sent into the light. That is what you need to focus on doing more than anything. If you choose to do such a thing like this, I suggest you don't do this alone and have at least one or two other people present there with you while you attempt to do this. And, don't forget to surround yourself/visualize as well as the other people who might be present there with you with white light. Sometimes, Earthbound people/entities can be a bit dangerous...

G'day/night all. Just wanted to maybe share a little technique that might help some of you to project a bit more. I discovered this a long while back whenever I was beginning to project, and for some reason decided to especially try using it again this morning sometime. (9-28-02, Sat.)
<br>
<br>
This started out today whenever I was basically feeling a lot of energy building up in an area in my physical body and decided to use this energy to further help me project out of body. I somehow found a way to shift and spread out this built up energy so it would be evenly distributed to the rest of my body. I used it to help my astral body keep shifting and moving itself in an in and out motion inside of my physical body. I kept doing this until I eventually wound up completely shifting myself out. This was great! I basically just used energy to shift out more and more until I was able to exit out all together.
<br>
<br>
In order to do this, just try 'feeling' yourself 'shifting' in and out of your physical body. Also, see your astral self accomplish doing this until you know that you really are out. If you feel vibrations or a build up of energy, use it to your advantage to help project out! Hope this helps! ~

thanks for chatting, and I will try to answer your questions. Tai chi raises ones kundalini, slowly and safely. It teaches you to earth and disipate chi / kundalini out through the hands and feet before you begin to push it into the head and out the crown chakra for astral travel etc. This takes a while but it is better than the side effects such as panic attacks, delusions, headaches, paranoia etc, of too much uncontrolled kundalini. Kundalini surging out through the top of the head when beginning to OOB can often be painful too.
<br>
<br>
Trance work with patients is hypnotherapy, yes, much the same though I no longer induce a hypnotic state, I just get them to 'imagine' then away they go. Hypnosis proper takes a lot of time and practice, so I use 'trance work' as a faster and more direct method for therapy for accessing past trauma and then to heal it. It is not as deep as hypnosis but is more effective for healing.
<br>
<br>
Personally I meditate lying down, it stops the head jerks and waking back up. It may not be fully kosha with some schools of meditation, but by heck it works for me.
<br>
<br>
As for the farm ghosts, I think that they are the victims of abuse, over a number of generations. For some reason they have resisted the prayers and meditations and 'sending to the light' of several meditation seers in the past months. Some did leave, but the rest, as I said, about 8 or 9, there may be less now, have decided to stay, I don't know why, they just don't want to go.
<br>
<br>
Your advice is good, I have 'been out' there working with spirits by myself before with no side effects, but I am a bit more careful with this lot. So I will take your advice and do it with a friend. I have seen them when in trance when I was there, but as I said I couldn't stay longer than a few seconds, they dumped me out each time.
<br>
<br>
The 'ley lines' or 'Earth rays' are energy beams I suppose you could call them, that penetrate or originate from the ground and rise upwards. They are what dowsers feel when they dowse for water. It has also been found that ley lines can be dangerous if slept over as they over energise the body eventually leading to ill health. It is like being exposed to too much electrical pollution, too much is bad for you.
<br>
<br>
What I felt was through the L rod I made from a wire coat hanger when I got there. The rooms that were most often visited and affected by the ghosts also had the highest level of earth rays, very strong, maybe this made it easier for the ghosts to manifest in those places. I dowsed the house and yard, and two lines intersected in the kitchen, and each line was very powerful. If you want to know more about dowsing there is an American Dowsers Society somewhere in the USA, I am sure that they have a web site.

Take care guys, see ya out there...

~ No problem, and thanks, I appreciate it too! I've been wondering about the Tai chi for quite some time as other related issues that you've talked about here. ~ BLightM

<br>
<br>
~ Is Tai chi similar to what Robert's NEW? Have you used NEW before? I know about kundalini energy as well. This is one's 'creative' energy, right? The fun loving energy that a person at most instances can use to create beautiful pieces of artwork with for example. Prana is the energy that seems to mostly exist outside that one can breathe in to help naturally bring in more and energize the individual. Prana's basically outside energy that must exist within the oxygen we breathe...those are my educated guesses anyway.

<br>
<br>
~ So, having too much 'uncontrolled' kundalini can actually lead one to experiencing those particular effects?  Indeed that's not good! I've heard that too much of anything can't be good for one, and I guess that includes having too much kundalini now too! ~ BLM
<br>

It is not as deep as hypnosis but is more effective for healing." Astralc
<br>
<br>
~ I've heard of hypnotherapy before but never thought of it as being 'trance work' before. That's a pretty Intriguing way to look at it though.  Could hypnotherapy as well as hypnosis enable the one who's inducing this help their client block out and forget their past trauma for good out of their subconscious mind, especially if the person would want to move on with their life better than they have in remembering their traumas? Just something that popped up in my head I was wondering about. ~ BLM
<br>
<br>
"Personally I meditate lying down, it stops the head jerks and waking back up. It may not be fully kosha with some schools of meditation, but by heck it works for me." Astralc
<br>
<br>
~ Thanks for telling me that. I have a very difficult time meditating while sitting up too. Darn head jerking/nodding/falling. After around 30+ minutes, that always seems to happen to me, of course, only while sitting in an upright position. There would be something a bit wrong if that would happen while I was meditating lying down! (((giggling))) So, the way that normally seems to work very well for me as well as being able to keep my mind clear of wondering thoughts is to just meditate as well as use astral sight while lying down too. ~ BLM

<br>
<br>
~ One of my guesses as to why these ghosts continue to want to stay is maybe they're not really there and are just left over energy that has been left and stored in this particular area by the people who were once abused. Therefore, they may not actually be ghosts of people who are there and are just their energy essences that continues to thrive there. Just one guess I had. My other thought about this is that they may have some kind of unfinished business that they feel that they want to do before just moving on. Or, they're obsessed with what they were once doing there while they were alive and desire to just stay there, maybe until they tire of doing whatever it is that makes them want to stay there. There are certain spiritual groups you could call upon who work within the spirit and astral realm that you might be able to call to help you out in dealing with them that I know of and have also worked with in the past while taking Earthbound people into the light. If you'd like, you may indeed feel free to PM me anytime. I'll also provide you with more tips on how to deal with this as well. However, stubborn ghosts/Earthbound entities can really be very resistant in wanting to move on, and sometimes this also can be due to them actually being afraid of moving into the light for some reason or the other. This factor could yet be 'another' reason why they've never moved on too... ~ BLM

<br>
<br>
~ Really? That's wonderful to hear. It's really terrible that seemingly so many people whenever they pass on get 'stuck' and don't just walk into the light. Don't other loved ones and family members that they once knew of hang around whenever the living person passes on to help them get to where they're suppose to go to in the first place? And thanks for wanting to take some of my advice.  If your friend does the same thing as you, then maybe the two of you could both work on taking these people into the light together as well as have an even stronger form of protection placed around the two of you as you work. All you really have to do is imagine white light around yourselves while doing this, just in case any of these people might wind up being a bit on the dangerous as well as negative side...especially the more 'resistant' ones. ~ BLM

<br>
<br>
~ Thanks for telling me more about what those are. Is this what others have said as being, "radiation"? Or, are ley lines still another thing you're referring to? I was somewhat thinking about something entirely different then. I was thinking about black power cords I use to see whenever I was projecting into the astral often whenever I was in flight while out of body. Maybe they really were just other projector's silver cords and weren't necessarily black. They did use to really frighten me though! They seemed to give off a very fearful electrical and dangerous feeling. I still encounter them every so often, but not nearly as often as once before a few months ago. ~ BLM

<br>
<br>
~ As I had mentioned a bit before here, maybe the ghosts that are there are just some kind of energy as well as astral copy of who was once there. I've heard that if a person who was living at another location for a long time had felt a strong feeling or emotion, this could cause that particular kind of energy build of to be left there. Just thought I'd mention this to you. But who really knows, I could be wrong about that and this could be one of them at those specific areas you had been dowsing at the time. ~ BLM

~ You take care too. It's nice to hear of another lightworker here. I hope that the people at this one place will decide to move on or will be helped soon. Staying behind and not moving on will only hinder their spiritual growth and progression, which is quite sad. ~ BLM
