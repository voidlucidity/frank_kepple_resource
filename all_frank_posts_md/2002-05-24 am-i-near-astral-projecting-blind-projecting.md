<section>
I've recently bought robert's bruce astral dynamics, and I believe I'm actually or near projecting or blind projecting?  The first few weeks I tried projecting I felt my arms hitting the ground from my bed, was just my arms sticking out?
<br>
<br>
After the 4th week I came really close or it looked to me like blind projecting, I did the water sky (mostly)/big wheel side/top rope thing.  What happened today after I was doing it for an hour and a half (didn't do any warm up just went straight to projection), I felt like my body levitated above the bed then was shoved off the side of the bed on its own, it was shocking because it was like a REFLEX did it on its own I don't think any astral being did it, then I felt like I hit the ground but couldn't move or see my back feet were still stuck to my body, then I thought in my head might try the rope technique to break out as I was doing it, I started to hear for few seconds radio type sounds like tuning out of radio stations, then I broke free and was walking and felt objects in front of me and I knew I could pass through them so I walked through it with little resistance and felt a tingling sensation on the bottom part of my body that was touching it, the only problem to all of this is I was still blind I didn't see anything only could feel things like a blind person and second my astral body felt real like a physical body and I didn't hear no buzzing sounds/vibration sounds like they say you're supposed to feel/hear when you break free?  So what happened did I do a astral projection or could you call this a partial projection?  Just really weird because I felt as though I was free but still couldn't see anything but it felt real objects and such in front of me.  After ten seconds i got worried I better get back to my body or else I may forget this, then I just starting feeling myself,looking at myself and then I opened my eyes in my bed.
<br>
<br>
why did I levitate and was thrown off the bed was it because of the water sky technique caused the reflex that way? water sky technique I feel myself pushing my whole body out of the bed to the edge of the bed and feel as though I'm standing straight, and taking notice that my body is back behind me lying down on the bed (thats how you're supposed to do it I suppose?) also the big wheel feel I'm going up with something a push upwards also a feeling I'm up above my body then feeling I'm high enough to have that scary heights feeling in stomach (force it so it would look real) then I feel moving above/forward then I feel I'm in front of my body then I feel I go back and get back to my body again thats the feelings I keep running in my mind when doing the big wheel exercise, the feeling and position I'm at.
<br>
<br>
am I close to a real projection since my first week I felt only my arms hit the ground of the bed, this time after 4 weeks my whole body hit the bottom of the bed and was able to break free?
<br>
<br>
what else can I do to get true astral projection with being able to see things, I know I have to do the exercise with a blank mind/closed eyes just simulating feelings is there anything else I could when I reach this stage again when I get out of my body am free but still blind?
<br>
<br>
really sucky projection, nice to be able to see things but amazing that I got this far in only a short time though.  some people take years to achieve their goal.  Or is my mind playing games on me?  Was I really projecting felt like I was feeling things around me and I wasn't making them up.
<br>
<br>
I also burn incenses sandalwood and mugwort I heard sandalwood is excellent for meditation and mugwort is good for astral when I do any meditation exercise.  sandalwood is amazing in that it does create bioelectric energy on its own without meditation so on top of the NEW system that creates even more energy and directs the energy throughout the body, it's a plus I think.

it seems like everyone has different experiences while out of body and in the process of getting there. i still can't see much. sometimes you can dream it however the real obe seems dreamlike sometimes. sometimes you can get out but not move very far. keep trying.

Not being able to see I think is common at first. I know it effected me and it still does to an extent.
<br>
<br>
First you need to think about opening your eyes and sight should come to you. As I said in another post, I used to wonder why I never saw any Astral entrance structures and the like. Then I discovered I'd hold my "eyes" shut during the separation/projection process without realising it.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I find it's like I can only see through one eye. In that my vision appears restricted on one side. But find if I stand still for a moment and think about seeing clearly then the problem goes away. Other times I've thought my eyes were closed, but I'd be in a dark place, or under the ground.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is stand still and concentrate on seeing. If you only see a sort of gloomy darkness, your "eyes" may be working but it could be that you are in a gloomy, dark place. In which case you need to fly off to somewhere different.
<br>

Try and tear the "blindness" away from your eyes and off your face. I had partial vision during an obe, so I started pulling at my face, and off came the hood of my favorite sweatshirt, and I could see. During a lucid dream my field of vision kept shrinking so I tore off the cloth that was over my head and threw it to the ground. Whatever works!
