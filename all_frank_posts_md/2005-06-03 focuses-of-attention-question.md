Here's a question I've not seen here yet..
<br>
<br>
So after we've finished our current earthly experience, have returned to f3/4...Do we still keep the ability to access our f2 area, or is it something that we only use for our f1 experiences?
<br>
<br>
If I were to ask myself the same question the obvious answer would be 'yes', since it's part of our continuum of consciousness, but I thought I'd ask as it seems an interesting question.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>

It is still part of our continuum of consciousness, yes, but Focus 2 is largely redundant once we switch our Primary Focus to Focus 3. I have no direct experience of the process, obviously, as my Primary Focus is within the physical. But from what I can gather after talking to a lot of people within Focus 3, it would appear that our "previous" physical life becomes in a sense like a dream, a very vivid dream. We still hold all the memories of our experiences within Focus 1, but people in the main appear quite happy with that. Like, people generally are happy being dead, "Dead and proud of it" as I call them.
<br>
<br>
Following our second physical-style life within Focus 3, we eventually shake off all notions of objectivity and transition to Focus 4, which becomes our Primary Focus. In which case we experience our "previous" physical life as a concept, together will all our other focuses of which we all have very many. All the other focuses are all us, as such, in terms of each being a focus of our collective Essence. But they are different people. What people are calling "past lives" they are confusing with the action of merging with one or other of their other focuses. You have never been and never will be any of your other focuses. You can merge with them, but you cannot become them as they are a "separate" individual.
<br>
<br>
We create Focus 2 in order to service our needs within the physical. The whole setup is what is known as a "source/manifest" reality. Focus 2 serves as the subjective source of our objective actions within Focus 1. So when you permanently withdraw from Focus 1, i.e. when you die, there is no longer any need for a Focus 2. But the focused energy pool that you created will always be a part of you.
<br>
<br>
You don't have to switch to Focus 4, you can continue living within Focus 3 if you wish. But eventually you might decide on creating other concepts for your experience. All this is done from Focus 4. In the old days, they thought that when you died you went to heaven if you were a "good" person, or to some place called hell if you were naughty. And naughty usually meant subscribe to the prevailing mass belief constructs the ruling elite of the day told you to. So a mere suppression tool in other words.
<br>
<br>
We now know that what these people were calling heaven and hell is, in fact, Focus 3 of consciousness. There you can still find loads of heavens and hells of the religious and other mystical-release-spiritual constructs if you wish. But you get a whole lot more besides.
<br>
<br>
A quick point I'd like to stress is we don't "return" to F4 as we never left it in the first place. We adopt Focus 4 as our Primary Focus. Perhaps you are aware of this anyway. But I want to stress this so people are not mistaken.
<br>

<section>
after we have 'returned' to F4 (in terms of our individual focus) can we then decide to engage on a new physical adventure somewhere else? or embark on some other new 'concept'? Could we decide to embark on another physical adventure in our own system or would it be a case of 'been there, done that'. (when i say 'could we...' i really mean 'is it common for...' as i realise that there are no real restrictions in the wider reality).

Doug:

<br>
There are no restrictions or limitations as I can see. Problem is in the understanding of the ongoing relationship between the conceptual of Focus 4 and the actual of Focus 1. Focus 4 is very new to me relatively speaking so it'll take me a while to pin it down. Well, the parts that relate to this system let's say.
<br>
<br>
When you adopt Focus 4 as your Primary Focus you "connect" with your total self. I use the word connect guardedly as you are not disconnected now. No one is. All we have done is chosen to focus our mental attention along a particular path. I always think of it as the difference between a very wide-angle lens (F4) and a telephoto (F1).
<br>
<br>
Here we have chosen to focus our sense of mental attention along a very specific path for the purposes of our experiencing a particular course of objective events. The concepts of which are formulated individually and en masse by us all within Focus 4, simply for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
Now, if you were to offer yourself a Focus 4 experience of the same kind as I have then, from within that experience, you would view your current physical life
<i>
 as a concept
</i>
. What I'm trying to get across is it's "just" a concept. That's all, nothing more than that. Your whole physical existence is reduced to a mere concept. Just one of zillions of possibilities. A physical life filled with experiences over, say, 80 years, from the Focus 4 perspective is a tiny drop in a huge ocean of experience.
<br>
<br>
The general thrust is on the expansion of experience, not a repetition of experience. One experience leads to another and another. Within Focus 4 there are many, many conceptual opportunities open to a person, including, I am assuming, the ability to repeat the experience of your current focus if you wanted. After all, there are no limits. But I very much doubt you would want to looking at it from the Focus 4 perspective. According to my knowledge it's not something that happens.
<br>

Yours,

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your reply on this, it's just so great being able to get straight answers to questions, having spent so many years wading through all this mystical goo...and I'm really finding it a load of goo in the last few months or so, to the point I just don't have the inclination to pick the mystical books up any more! Blachh!!
<br>
Now here's another odd question as of course I have no experience of it at the moment and that is; Do 'dead' people sleep?(LoL) I know sleeping is a physical requirement of this focus of reality, tho can the 'glorious-dead' as you call them still 'switch-off'? This kinda relates to my previous question about retaining the ability to play around in f2, in that as you and a few others are spending time in the Fz and listening to music, etc, can you still do this, to get some quiet time to yourself(If you feel like it)?
<br>
<br>
If I may draw you, for a moment about Focus 4 and your comments about how your life will never be the same subsequently. This has got me thinking/reflecting and I suppose speculating about the point to all of this 'life-time' stuff, in a lot of respects it seem almost like some kind of scientific 'double-bluff' experiment(If you get what I mean?). What I'm trying to articulate is the fact that despite there are roughly 6 billions of us living on this world at the moment(figuratively speaking), how is it that relatively few are actively attempting to find this truth about the 'real' nuts and bolts of what 'we' really are? I suppose the culmination to all of my experiences with the comparative theology stuff, with all the 'isms is that eventually(If you look hard/careful enough) you find they all lead to the same thing, which I can only surmise is why I ended up here, asking you all these pain in the neck questions!

LoL
<br>
What I've ascertained from various historical characters is that once you've acquired what appears to be an active knowledge/ realization of what can only be f4, then it means that your movement through consciousness is complete, or so they claim, since the figurative 'wool' can't be pulled over your eyes any longer. I can only guess that it might be something along these lines as I've found more or less the same thing from so many different sources. Â So... I'm wondering what you might have to say about this? Or is this perhaps the culmination of a lot of mystical goo?
<br>
<br>
Oh! I nearly forgot. Been reading a biography on a stand-up comic, by the name of 'Bill Hicks', he's been a favorite comedian of mine for quite a while now. Anyway, in the biography it's been saying that during one of his drug induced 'altered-states' he had what can only have been an f1/f4 overlay, was saying that he and a friend felt like they were plugged into a huge network of minds! It's only a small mention in the book, but it's there all the same
