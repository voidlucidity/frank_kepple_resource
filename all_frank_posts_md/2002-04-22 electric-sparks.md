Any one ever experience electric sparks in an obe.
<br>
Was one where a recently departed person came to my house, with a group of others.

Electric sparks, hmmm?  Dream Flashback!
<br>
<br>
Did you "see" sparks, "feel" them, or both?  I had an experience a few years ago when I first started to spontaneously OBE.  Sometimes I'd be dreamining and it would happen . . . which is a phenomenon I don't quite understand, but, oh well.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was having a dream where I was standing in a bathroom in front of a sink.  All of a sudden I felt these electric sparks fill up my entire body and I was thrown to the floor as if I were being electrocuted.  I lay there paralyzed on the bathroom floor for . . . well, way too long.
<br>
<br>
The thing is . . . now that I know better, I think they were vibrations.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if these "sparks" were anything like what you saw/felt, but your posting made me remember this dream!

Sounds interesting, but I can't say that I've experienced anything of this nature happen to me personally.  However if you click on the following link you'll read about a man who
<i>
 has
</i>
experienced these electrical-like sensations.  He mentions electric sparks on the 6th parapgraph.  This excerpt was taken from Robert Petersons book 'Out-Of-Body Experiences'.  He includes excerpts from other chapters at bottom of page.

Have experienced all kinds of sensations and "electric sparks" I come across often, both on the physical and on the Astral. They usually come about at the separation or re-entry stage.

Tisha, nightravler, frank,
<br>
<br>
Well, i was in the middle of this obe, real time, in my house, not coming or going, but the electric sparks were in the air, numerous, and this deceased person recognised them and spoke as if they had their own identity.
<br>
<br>
I touched a wall and got electricuted. I saw them and felt them.
<br>
It seemed to me that these sparks accompanied the dead people. Only a feeling i got.
<br>
<br>
Thanks, nightravler, i will check robert petersons information.
<br>
Sometimes i think i could permanently be out of my body, oh well, have to wait for death.
<br>
Paola

I have come across areas that seem alive with energy. Sometimes I fly through it and can feel a tingling in my body. Other times I have come across "scamps" as I call them, whose little party-trick is to give you a jolt of energy. It doesn't hurt so much as take you by surprise. Though I never came across any live sparks just hanging around in mid-air. Must be fun to watch.

 Yeah, I can understand your sentiments Alfa_33au, I
 <i>
  often
 </i>
 have a strange sense of homesickness too, and I've only had several astral projections in the last several years. It's nice to know that I'm not the
 <i>
  only
 </i>
 one who feels this way. Coincidently, OBE writer Albert Taylor mentions this too in his book as well as during a radio program with Art Bell.

When I had my first and only OOBE - when I raised my astral arm up into the air to look at it I felt sparks and heard cackling like static.

<section>
It seems like from all your posts, that this electric sparks thing has a condition.
<br>
Doesnt seem to be present all the time in obes.  I wonder.
<br>
<br>
Maybe frank, alive with energy is right, a presence maybe? maybe not.
<br>
<br>
A state reached maybe?
<br>
<br>
And nitetravler, how cool is that,  i find that looking forward to leaving the planet with grand curiousity makes living so easy.  Seems a dicotomy, one to smile about.  Hope you feel what im saying.
<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work!
<br>
<br>
Paola.
