YES! I'm almost 100% sure that I just projected! Wow.... Ok, it wasn't self induced... but it just happened, and everything was so vivid! Ok... I'm pretty sure it was sometime around 4 in the morning, and I had just woken up for some reason. Ok...  I don't know if this really happened, but I'm pretty sure it did.... I laid propped up with my elbow underneath me, and on my side. I don't know why I was doing this... I thing I was just doing that because I like to think about things early in the morning. I think I began to doze off... still in that position, and somehow... I have no idea how... I started to feel all weird, I can't really describe it now, almost like a twisting sensation, and I somehow  knew just to go with it, and this all happened in a matter of like seconds, and I just let my body "flow" almost, and I moved toward my ladder on my bed (I have a loft bed), and just let myself "flow" towards it. I could see my room... it was still night... but everything seemed different, like sort of echoing, well not echoing, but like... quiet or something, I don't know, I just had some sense that everything was different.
<br>
<br>
Ok, so this is where I'm positive that I APed. I went towards my ladder, and then, started going head first down it! I was FLOATING down my ladder! with my legs in the air! Ok, for someone who has never done this, it was quit weird. It felt like my insides were turning out, like almost the feeling when you drop during a roller coaster, but it felt so good. I think it was the adrenaline pumping through my body. I then started to test things out, to make sure it was real. Ok... this is where stuff gets kind of fuzzy. I might have had different wall paper on my wall, I can't remember, but i'm pretty sure I was just lightly hopping around my roof, letting my self float and then back down like moon physics, almost like on a trampoline. I then decided it was time to fly... : ). So.... I stood at my door, and just kind of went through it.. almost like it wasn't there.
<br>
<br>
Ok... so omg... I just had this feeling of everything coming back to me... ok.. .so I was at the top of my stairs, and I gave a little... GERONIMO!... and jumped forward down the stairs, and kind of just drifted to the bottom. I wanted to get outside, but everything was really dark, so I tried to look for my door. Everything got a little lighter, and I found it, and went through. THE NIGHT WAS BEAUTIFUL! I immediately began hopping around like some rabbit on the moon. I was jumping around my front yard trying to fly, but I couldn't get it! I would go up like 9 feet, and come back down. I don't know how long I did this, I remember running around the street, haha. OH YES! and i remember thinking that sometimes when people first OBE, it's harder to fly right away... and I remembered reading that on these forums ; ).
<br>
<br>
Ok... Since the flying wasn't going good, I thought that maybe it was a mental thing, and something that people use to fly would help me start out. I couldn't think of anything, so the closest thing I could think of was a broom, lol. I went inside, into my closet, and took out a broom. so I went back up my steps, and  right before I went through my door, I though to try something. I remember hearing people say that when you AP, try to look in a mirror or something, to see your reflection, it's usually interesting. So... I looked into the glass on the door... and whoa, my face looked weird. I had this really evil grin across my face, but it was almost like it looked like a cartoon character, my mouth was like stretching to my ears, it was kinda creepy actually. But it still kind of looked like me. I I couldn't think of anything, so the closest thing I could think of was a broom, lol. I went inside, into my closet, and took out a broom. and then went back outside.
<br>
<br>
Ok... so the broom did help. I began rising several feet, and me being scared of heights in the physical world, haha, I started to get nervous, but then I thought... WHO CARES! I CAN'T DIE! So I rose up to about 80 feet into the air, and was lightly flying down my street, when I heard all this yelling coming from my driveway. I drifted back over my front lawn, I was just about getting ready to shoot straight into the sky, into space, when I saw my mom and my dad arguing, both in their pajamas. My mom was saying something like " I don't know how he could just lay there like that without waking up!" (she was almost crying ) She somehow thought I was in sort of coma state. I think they found me, and shook me, and thought I was unconscious or something, and not just sleeping. Hovering in the air, I began to think... wait no... that couldn't happen, because when I project it should be like I'm sleeping? But it all sounded so real, and I could see them too. I started to think... how could this happen? Are they going to the hospital, why aren't they bringing me with? I started to get mad, because I had so much I still wanted to do. I flew down to about 50 feet, and over my cars in my driveway. I thought the best thing was to return to my body, even if I didn't want to, to make sure everything was ok with my parents.
<br>
<br>
I thought of lying in my bed, and right away, I woke up lying in my bed, but it was morning outside. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to make sense of everything. I shouldn't have waited that long, because now some stuff feels like a dream, or just really fuzzy. I'm sure I did other things, I just can't remember. I checked in with my parents, and they said they did nothing of that sort last night. So now I have several questions... was this an OBE, because some parts of it feel almost dream like... but I've never had a dream that vivid, and I remember thinking during it, something I've never done in a dream. Oh yeah, and I remember it was really cold outside, which it is in real life... and I usually don't feel like sensations in a dream that lifelike. And, the fact that my parents didn't do that? How could that be explained?  I dunno if this was an OBE or not, but it was a damn good experience. Most fun I've had in a while.
<br>
<br>
<br>
So if it was an OBE, does that mean my next ones while be easier to induce? Since I wasn't trying to AP, does that mean I'm still at the same level as I was before it, when I last tried? Ok, well thank you guys for listening, it truly was a wonderful experience, I just wish I could remember more of it. I didn't have any of the problems that most people mention during their first OBE, if it was one, only the flight thing.
<br>
<br>
THANK YOU, AND GOOD LUCK!

STOP questioning it!  You've done it!
<br>
<br>
That was great to read - had me laughing out loud.  Floating down with your legs in the air...ha ha ha.  I know that feeling!
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you had a LOT of fun.  The broom - ha ha, that's too funny.
<br>

That's awesome!
<br>
<br>
So far I have had about 6 or 7 RTZ projections and none of mine were as long or as clear as yours.  I always lose clarity right when I get out and never have much control over what I do.
<br>
<br>
About it seeming kind of like a dream...it wasn't.  It is common for RTZ projections to seem very clear as they are happening, but more dream like when you wake up and remember it.  You may have been slipping into dream a little bit when you saw your parents arguing, but otherwise it was a great RTZ projection!
<br>
<br>
Good job

Yep, you did it alright. But don't start questioning it too much at this stage, practice having more and more of them and the answers will come to you as a matter of course.
