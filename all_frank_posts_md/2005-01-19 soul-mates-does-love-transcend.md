Does love with a soul mate transcend?

The Love does transcend.  It's not neccessarily physical love.  Soulmates can be brother/sister, Parent/child, or even just friends.  And you can have more than one.
<br>
<br>
Ask yourself this:  Did you soulmate help you over some great challenge?  Did they help you cross a spiritual threshhold?  Popular theme lately....

Hi Astral Soul,
<br>
Soul mates don't have to have a Loving, Relationship, Together.  There are way more possibilities.
<br>
<br>
When we can look at our experiences and search for the Things that were  in it for Us, we change it to Positive.  Every experience has something for you.  This may sound strange to you, Souls have made agreements to provide experiences, when we come here in the same 'time' we then work those contracts out to Experience it completely in the world.
<br>
<br>
Searching out the positives of our experiences can help.  The quite pain we carry inside can be dulled by the understanding of our choices and experiences.
<br>
<br>
Looking at things this way, usually in hindsight, we can see the great service we have provided for other Souls.  The service to your babe may have been you providing the needed lifetime for a close Soul..  and what a beautiful service to give.... to Love a Soul so as to choose your exact experience !  You are a wonderful Soul,  Astral Soul.

Tayesin is absolutely right - everyone who enters our life comes into it for a reason.  Sometimes they are there to learn something from us, and for us to learn something from them.  They can provide us with the challenge to alter patterns of behaviour in ourselves, or simply just to appreciate that they are who they are.
<br>
<br>
I sense you are talking of soulmates in the respect of physical love?  The trouble with human relationships is that they are often addictive.  When we first meet someone we always show our "best side", then some time into the relationship we relax into who we really are.  This is when we start feeling that the other person has let us down and our expectations get in the way.  A lot of people are also addicted to the "in love" state, which generally doesn't last, at least in that form.
<br>
<br>
When you meet the one you are destined to spend the rest of your life with, the love will most likely be entirely different.  It also helps to really get to know someone first.  If you can get to know them as a best friend for, say, a year or so before entering into the relationship, you already know eachothers irritating habits and bad points and choose to be with them anyway.  That is true love as opposed to infatuation, and it is a calmer, happier state to be in!

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is not what you want to hear but, to my mind, you are better off without him. The moment I read about him coming at you with violence then that just turned me off completely.
<br>
<br>
I do not know the ins and outs of it, of course, but to me there is no excuse for violence against a woman. Okay, men can get into argy-bargy between themselves. That's just the way men can be sometimes. But against women, no way. Men are born with a strong instinct to protect women, not hit out at them. So any man that hits out at a woman has got something severely wrong in his character, IMO.
<br>
<br>
So, as far as I am concerned, nope, you didn't meet your soulmate. You met a nasty character you should be glad to be rid of. I am sorry to sound so blunt, I really am. But I just pity the next one he meets.
<br>
<br>
I am not sure whether misguided is the right word to describe you. Confused you must certainly have been. I think, perhaps, you should spend some time concentrating on yourself. Get yourself together more and make sure you are fully recovered from the experience before taking the plunge again, as it were.
<br>
<br>
"Soul mate" is a term that's talked about quite a bit these days, especially on forums such as these. I'm not at all sure what it means, exactly. I know what it means to me. But many times I read a different interpretation to the one I always think of.
<br>
<br>
When we fall in love, truly fall in love, we never do stop loving. Because true love is offered without expectation. I have been fortunate to have fallen deeply in love like this, a number of times in my life. Each time it taught me a lot, about myself, about others, and about life generally.
<br>
<br>
The last time taught me, in particular, about how precious each moment can be, and about how we should always savour the closeness we feel with someone, and to always appreciate each moment of togetherness. Because you just never know when it might end.
<br>
<br>
I wish you all the best.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Not everything happens for a reason, what, you believe in some master plan where nothing random ever happens?
<br>
<br>
From what I've read of other's comments on soul mates (since I have no experience myself), they're basically just people we were lovers or best friends with in a past life, so they're 'soul mates' because your souls were 'mates'. Nothing more. A love or marriage with a non-soul mate in this life could be your next life's soul mate. Yay!

Hello Astral Soul,
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

 As a result, I have been finding it difficult to believe that it is possible to find love that is enduring.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
The problem with the "love" between two humans is that it is extremely rarely "true love". We all talk of love, and degrees of it, we may even experience it, but still, do we really understand it?
<br>
<br>
I was once in a similar situation to you. After a significant relationship in my life ended, I felt extremely confused about "love".  Had I not been loving? How could our understanding of love be so different? I was really confused for a while, so much so, that I actually went around searching for what "love" actually meant.
<br>
<br>
Fast forward 4+ years, and I found my answer...
<br>
<br>
The love between humans is not true love. True love is self-less and conditionless. When we find a person we love and then we ask ourselves why we love that person, we always come up with reasons. "I love her because she is kind to me, beautiful, we really understand each other, etc".... These are all conditions. When these conditions dissapear, we seem to fall out of love with that person. So this, is not true love, it never was.
<br>
<br>
The only ones capable of expressing true love are very realized Enlightened souls who no longer desire anything in life
<span class="bbc_size" style="font-size: 7px;">
 (because they are 100% happy, 100% of the time)
</span>
, who will love you if you are a an ugly thief, a materialistic super model, or a Mother Theresa. Their love is *Divine*, and thus eternal and truly conditionless.
<br>
<br>
So what are we to do then? Should we still try to find a loving partner knowing it will be imperfect love? If you desire it, and if it will make you happier, then yes. In my experience, relationships between humans make us grow by leaps and bounds, and in essence we are here on Earth to learn aren't we? Even if the love isn't conditionless or "true love" by my definition, it can still be a very beautiful experience, letting us smile a little more each day.
<br>
<br>
It sounds crazy, but Love is worth the heart ache! I do not regret anyone I ever fell in love with. I am so thankful and much richer/mature today by having endured those beautiful experiences.
<br>
<br>
May divine love shine upon you and cure your aching heart,
<br>
Adept of Light

It is up to you to decide what soul mate means to you, but most soul mates I find are simply one's who have shared an balanced and loving relationship for so long that their energies just kind of "blend." Hard to describe in words actually.
<br>
<br>
Kereen, my spirit guide, was my wife in a previous lifetime
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
this sounds very unprecedented for how guides are viewed as, but the general view of spirit guides I find is generally wrong.
<br>
<br>
Some things I often think about is: how do I improve/make someone more "complete" and how do they do so for me? What is is about a person that makes them so special? Why do I feel the way that I do? What are the specific reasons I tend to stick to characters with certain personality types and how does this help or hurt me? Would I benifit with trying to hang around other types of personalities so I can learn more of the world? These types of questions help me to understand not only the soul mate philosphy, but myself and others as well.
