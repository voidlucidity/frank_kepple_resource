Hi everyone at Astral Pulse
<img alt=":o" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
<br>
<br>
I'm abyss, I live in London, England. I've been focused on spirituality for a few years now (healing, clairvoyance
<i>
 and
</i>
naturally, Astral Projection, among other things).
<br>
<br>
Who knows how long I'll be here but, while I'm here, I'm sure I'll connect with a lot of interesting people. I'm looking forward to sharing experiences with ya'll.
<br>
<br>
Love. Light.

Welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
Haven't been to the Old Blighty capital for ages. Still as noisy and polluted as ever with wall-to-wall traffic I'm assuming! LOL Give Queenie a shout for me when you're passing next. Has been ages since I gave her head a lick, ha ha ha...
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Lol. Frank I had a good laugh from your post. Thanks! I just thought I'd check to see who's  new and who's leaving - not that I even know 1% of the people on this forum, but hey, curiosity won out on this occasion. I'm glad I popped back.
<br>
<br>
Nice, Frank. Real nice.
