Hi,
<br>
Have to say the bunch of moo-cows you found who can spell properly are a great bonus to the Forums.
<br>
<br>
They are so smart they can even translate Australian into American.  And this is important coz we know we write a different language, LOL.
<br>
<br>
I think the Edumacated Cow was a great addition.
<br>
<br>
Oh, and how can I get myself one of these cows ?  Are they a special breed ?  And do they still give milk ?  My ten year old daughter would love to have one do her homework.
<br>

Great work swapping the Forums over folks.

I think sanity is kinda over-rated myself.

BTW, I voted "definitely".

That was a foregone conclusion, Tayesin old chum. You can, however, take consolation in the fact that only 11 people voted. Now if it had been me then I'd have had about 11-hundred people all saying the same thing!!!

<br>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

How can be people be sure enough to use the word "definitely" when they're not sure how to spell it?
<br>
<br>
Are dark forces at work?

The same demon must be affecting your grammar.

LOL

Actually, I didn't even notice the point you just brought-up. Heh, a thread about spelling properly, and Tay spells "definitely" wrong. Oh the irony! LOL

Holy moocows!
<br>
<br>
I've been making a lot of those mistakes recently... just plain forgetting words, probably from typing too fast.
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm housing a "speed demon."
