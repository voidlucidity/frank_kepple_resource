I'm impressed, this forum is *really* swish... classy even. Full marks to all who got it together.
<br>
<br>
I wondered if two options were available, though.
<br>
<br>
I put "no country" in my personal options to get rid if the flag. I'm sorry, but there is something about flag-waving that just doesn't appeal to me. Is there a way of just having the country specified in the personal options?
<br>
<br>
The other thing I wanted to ask: is it possible to switch off in personal preferences the colour change as you move the mouse pointer up and down the forum titles?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

And the other thing I just realised I need to ask from my previous post, is how do I stop those flaming green question marks that are coming up when I press: ?
<br>

Greetings Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your comments and kind remarks.
<br>
<br>
I am pleased you that you like the new layout and features [

]
<br>
<br>
Regarding your comments:
<br>
<br>
I actually agree about the flag waving - I was in two minds whether to include it on the posts or not. I have now switched it off in the posts, and it will now only appear in the members listings. Perhaps you would be so kind as to put the UK back in your profile now [

] We need to keep ourselves represented from this part of the world.
<br>
<br>
As for the hover feature - it isn't possible to switch them off individually. I will await further feedback on that one - I rather like it myself, but the forum is for the members.
<br>
<br>
As for the green question marks - I am not sure what you were pressing Â - but I will look into it right away!
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Adrian: thank you for your response.
<br>
<br>
The BBS is really swish, I want to make that totally clear. Yep, if it's not an option about the colour change as you scan up and down, well, so what. I just thought it might be an option that I'd missed.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,
<br>
Frank

I would think to have these anomalies and preferences sorted out soon enough.
<br>
<br>
