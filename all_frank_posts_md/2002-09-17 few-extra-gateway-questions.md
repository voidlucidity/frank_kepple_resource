<section>
I think I am almost understanding the things you are describing, Frank.
<br>
Frank:
<br>
Here are my last few questions, if you don't mind answering them (and, of course, everyone else is free to as well):
<br>
1. When you now get into Focus 10 from C1, is it comparable to a shift like going from waking consciousness into a lucid dream? From your comments, it seems like you would say yes. I am not saying that all F10 is, is a Wake Induced Lucide Dream, I am mainly talking about the shift into F10. I;ve read comments where you say to "step into" the scenery, and that is the image I got into my head. Focusing away from your body until your waking consciousness is in this other "place." This would also make it much easier to get to the other focus levels, since it seems to me like F10 is the biggest shift. Also, I have read that Monroe always used to say that a person can get to any Focus level by having a good F10/12 base, and using it to slingshot them to the desired level, so this would make sense. I should have probably waited to do Gateway at TMI until I had a good F10 base, I probably would have gotten a lot more out of it. I bet you would have an absoultely amazing time there.
<br>
2. I remember when I first started using Hemi-Sync, I notice now when I lay down and everything is queit, I hear a high pitched buzzing or ringing in my head. I have read the same thing from people on the Voyager Mailing List, so I wanted to know if you now have that as a side-effect as well. Now that I have started using binaural beats again heavily, it is VERY noticeable. Some people say it is tinnitus (spelling?), in any case, it is annoying.
<br>
<br>
OK, so I guess I only had 2 questions. I also wanted to say that I really liked Monroe's idea of consciousness as a continuum, like a radio tuner. I also reaenjoy reading your comments, along with Adrian's respones to you. It seems like you both are talking about the same things, but they are from 2 different perspectives. I always wondered how Monroe's focus levels coincided with AP, and it seems like you and Adrian have kinda cleared it up.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time

It's not a "shift" but more of a gradual phasing-out of C1 which culminates in the feeling of being at F10 as per Monroe's instructions. I start to lose awareness of my physical body from F3 mainly. From which I gradually lose physical-body sensations as my mental focus moves further away.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, I'm not sure whether our definitions of lucid dream are the same.
<br>
<br>
When at F10, I have full waking consciousness so I am fully aware that "back there" somewhere is a physical body but my attention is taken up elsewhere. It's like if you were sitting reading and had become engrossed in a book. There is a part of you that is aware you are sitting in a room, reading. But because you are mentally focused on the book, awareness of your surroundings is heavily dulled.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 In fact, the mindstate people go into when heavily engrossed in a book is very similar to the F10 mindstate. Only instead of your consciousness running along with the mental imagery created by the words in the book, you create a particular mental-imagery structure in accordance with the guidance on the Wave 1 CD

<br>
Yes, that is what it feels like to me. Like I have "stepped into" another reality. In the sense I have full waking consciousness, and I'm at a place that feels as real and as tangible as the Physical: only it's the Astral.

Rather than "shift" I, personally, see it more of a gradual transition. But that's probably just our using different terminology to describe basically the same thing. It *is* the most important as F10 is a springboard to all the other non-physical focus levels, through use of Intent.
<br>
<br>
This is because, once you have focused into one non-physically reality realm, you basically use the same "focusing" technique to focus into the other non-physical reality realms. Same focusing technique, just a slightly different phasing.
<br>
<br>
Like learning to drive a car. Once you can drive one car, you can basically drive any other car: same basic controls; steering wheel; gearshift; pedals, etc. The make/model/degree of technological sophistication, etc. may vary, but the basic controls are the same.

I agree, you probably would have. I'm not sure about myself, though. It's just that a lot of the TMI writeups come across as being a tad too touchy-feely for my tastes. Like, all the holding hands and chanting around a crystal stuff.

Sorry, but I cannot help you there. I, personally, have had no side-effects (other than increasing my ability to visit the Astral).

I'm not sure whether you are hearing these high pitched sounds when you are listening to the CD, or when you are lying down not listening to anything. If its the latter, then tinnitus is the main cause for this symptom. Your doctor will sort it out no problem.
<br>
<br>
If it is while listening to the CD, I can hear high pitched sounds at times during the gateway exercises. I think that some people are probably more physically sensitive to them than others.

Regarding high pitched buzzing.
<br>
<br>
I have been meditating with various forms for over 35 years I guess, and somewhere along the line began to notice this in myself.  For the life of me I cannot recall which author of meditation books may have mentioned that it was a normal sign of some sort of development but I never gave it much concern.
<br>
<br>
The same is not true of a friend of mine, who regarded it as irritating, and has undertaken over ten years of medication, surgery and general grief because of it.  In her case it is tinnitus, and I really have no way of knowing if what I am hearing is the same as hers.
<br>
<br>
In my case it gets louder the more inwardly focused I seem to be.  The one time I came close to projecting it got really loud, as I was mentally 'cranking up the volume' as part of the exercise.  When I felt myself begin to leave my body I got very excited and fell back in though.
<br>
<br>
Doreen Virtue, a woman who writes and lectures about angels, said to us that this noise might simply be a sort of channel hiss put in place by angels as a way of assuring us that the line was open.  She suggested that the angels have no way of knowing how loud or irritating it seems to us though, so if we want them to turn it down a tad we can just ask them.  I got a kick out of her description and thought it made an odd sort of sense.  Sure enough, whenever I inwardly asked for the volume to go down, down it went.
<br>
<br>
I cannot broach the subject with my friend though.  She is so tuned into her ongoing struggle that this suggestion seems to trivialize the thousands of dollars of fruitless treatment she has had, and I suppose that for the forseeable future she has chosen to fight tinnitus.  On the other hand perhaps hers is indeed a different phenomenon, negs perhaps.  She is equally averse to that suggestion too, being way beyond me spiritually.
<br>
<br>
From what I have seen of her experience though, I would suggest that tinnitus is not simple to treat.  Each treatment worked for a while, except for some of the more powerful drugs which made her feel crappy instead.  So I don't know.  Tough subject.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand perhaps I don't have tinnitus, but just an angel connection!  Great idea that!
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>

I forgot to mention that when I was in training to be a TMI instructor, ringing in the ears was on Stanslav Graf's list of symptoms of kundalini rising, which as instructors we had to become familiar with so as to help folks with it.  Helping in most cases amounted to one of many kinds of grounding exercises.

Thanks for the reply Steve.
<br>
I first noticed the buzzing after I initially listened to Wave 1 my freshman year in college. It kind of subsided as I gradually stopped listening to Hemi-Sync cd's. I now have started (but put on hold, because of the buzzing) listening to Wave 1 again, along with a homebrew 4khz binaural beat that I made with BWGen.
<br>
The buzzing now is very loud, and it started when I was listening to the 4khz wave as I was going to sleep. It was a little louder than I usually have it, and I decided to turn it off after a litte while. I turned on my side and BAM, the ringing came back full force and has been loud ever since.
<br>
I'll try and politely ask internally for "someone" to turn down the volume.

<section>
I am curious about what happened when you asked.  The story I got was that the agents who send the buzzing signal have no idea how loud it seems to us and they need us to tell them.  I like it so that it is just at the edge of awareness.  If I check, it is always there but mostly when I am interested to hear it.
<br>
<br>
To me it is reassuring, sort of lets me know that I am still connected up even though no particular other signals are happening at the time.  Maybe something like a carrier wave...
<br>
<br>
Best wishes!
