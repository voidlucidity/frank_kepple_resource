Maybe it would help if you put the term in context for us. It sounds more literary to me than it probably is, such as only using a few words from someone else instead of copying several paragraphs and putting them in quotes.

Google turned up a 'UV Light Quote' for me, but I don't know how much relevance that has to this topic. :/

My immediate reaction after doing a quick Google search is that "light quotient" is a giant sign saying "kick me" that you are generously offering to anyone who wants to wear one.

Ah, right, that makes all the difference then. Er, light quotient, explain it to him Telos, you're the bright spark around here. :)
