<section>
Im sorry to put a non-OBE topic in here, but I thought many of you guys might have a say on this.
<br>
<br>
My entire life has been a search for a higher meaning. The meaning of life. Ok, let me get to the point.
<br>
<br>
What is "God"? Who is he?
<br>
<br>
It seems to me like the univers was created by design. And design most be created by, well, creativety wich means some kind of inteligence or counsciousness.
<br>
<br>
Simple rules that in the end rusults in complex constructions and situations.
<br>
<br>
Many of us on this forum, with our "new" knowledge and views on life, would like to think that there is no god. We are free. We are our own god.
<br>
<br>
I agree to some extent, but some most have started it all.
<br>
<br>
Maybe god is a collective intelligence of all the counsciousness in the universe, wich we are all part of.
<br>
<br>
Maybe:
<br>
<br>
God=Knowledge(counsciosness)*action(energy)
<br>
(that equation was not a formal, just an idea.)
<br>
<br>
Anyways that equation most have been used 13,7 billion years ago when the big bang was unleashed.
<br>
<br>
Why would anyone create a universe?
<br>
Obviously the universe and life was made inperfect. Dramatic cosmic and bad big and minor life situations happens all the time. Cataclysms also. I dont know a single person who havent met resistance in life. Lets face it; Life basicly sucks!
<br>
But resistance makes one stronger.
<br>
Maybe thats it.
<br>
God(wich equals all of us) made the universe just to make him/us stronger...
<br>
<br>
I wont go into too much details.
<br>
<br>
Please front on this coz it needs to be figured out... or maybe its not suposed to...
<br>
Who knows, do you?

I love topics like this.  It's too much.
<br>
Everyone has his/her opinions about this.  Some people don't believe in god.  Some people do for no reason (like me).  Some people must find a reason behind everything.  It's up to you and you are free to believe in whatever you like.
<br>
I truly don't know what god is.  I believe universe is simply a  god's expression in order to give meaning to its existance.  God has to have a life too you know.

<br>
<br>
Er, because they can?
<br>
<br>
Amazingly, there are those people whose degrees of freedom and level of ability extends to the extent where they can take basic matter and form it into universes and stuff. Sounds pretty whacky, I agree.

In Response
<br>
<br>
Some answers that might help were given on a site posted by "Spirit Gurl" under the "Philosophy" forum.  Look at her last pages of replies, Page 7.  Look at my reply there.  It's lengthy, but I think you will find it helpful.  I think you will find some interesting understandings about God.

I don't know if you want to be looking forward to death.  Maybe acceptance would be better.  You need to be happy while your hear on Earth.  Death shouldn't be an escape but another level in our developement.

I believe in a God...one that loves and knows us.  I believe there are more than one God and I believe we can become Gods.  God is infinite, we are infinite.  No beginning, no end.  The truth comes to each one of us in flashes, but we can know for sure there is a God.

<br>
Well to be honest, somtimes I have been looking forward to death. Thats only because of pain. But we all experience pain in our life's, external or internal or both. But i believe or "know" that there is a meaning behind it. Nothing happens without a reason. We are all stranded on this planet to experience just that. No humans that I know are strong super-inteligent or anything that seems god-like at all. I thing that God is something we are all part of, but us (the humans) are quite far away from whatever that is God.
<br>
<br>
But as we evolve we will get closer. In short we are at a lower level.
<br>
I think that there are beings in the universe that are far more sofisticated than us, thereby closer to God than we are.
<br>
<br>
I dont nesecerily mean technologicly, but also spirituly evolved.
<br>
<br>
Most humans dont even recognize the spirit in our selves.
<br>
<br>
We can only begin to understand what power lies within "knowing"
<br>
<br>
It seems to far fetched for us to think about stuff like that. We are too conserned about our life situations and the physical matters that surrounds us.... and with good reason, actualy.
<br>
<br>
I know that OBE's have given me a confirmation that there is more to the universe than what we call "reality" and that there is nothing to fear but fear itself, wich is what "evil" is based on.
<br>
<br>
Basicly we need to get spiritualy stronger and wiser

i   think  instead of dwelling  on  it  to much  we should look  at ways  to highten  our   consciousness  until we wont need to ask  questions  such as "what  is god"
<br>
<br>
like  the ways  to project into  the higher planes---
