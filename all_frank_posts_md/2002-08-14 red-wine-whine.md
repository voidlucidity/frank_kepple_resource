WAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>
I'm a wine drinker.  I lean toward cabernets and merlots from Italy, France, Australia, and sometimes California.  Every New Year's resolution was "drink more wine."  A glass a day, for my heart.
<br>
<br>
But no more.  My doctor says red wine is bad for my delicate whitey skin.  Actually, everything I love is bad for me, including spicy foods, fancy face creams, physical exertion, the weather, you-name-it.  Look at me funny and I break out in a rash.  So that I won't become a beet-faced Celt, I'm stuck with a boring prescription and a bland diet, which I'll have to follow if I don't want to look like W.C. Fields when I'm 50.
<br>
<br>
My doctor suggested white wines as a compromise.  So, are there any other wine drinkers out there who like white wine?  What do you recommend?  Something light, dry . . . ?   I can't bring myself to drink beer or hard liquor, since they have no beneficial health properties to speak of (unless one is trying to gain weight, which I am not).
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>

I am not a white wine drinker, I prefer red wine like you. I am just wondering how bad is red wine for you? I mean can you never drink it again? Maybe you should get a second opinion. I am no doctor but I have not heard of red wine being bad for the skin, but could be wrong. Certainly you can drink a glass every now and then can't you?
<br>
<br>
I have actually read that dark beers are good for you, much like red wine. So if you like beer you might want to try something dark.
<br>
<br>
Everything is bad for us anymore. What are we suppose to do just eat soy and drink purified water? Unless something is a major health risk to you I say moderation is the key. Something may not be the best thing to eat or drink (but what is?) but in most cases if it is taken in moderation along with exercise then you can live happy and healthy.
<br>
<br>
Hmm maybe this post is not that helpful, except the dark beer part. I hope that helps.

Yikes! What horrible fate!
<br>
I used to get horrible migraines from reds but not anymore. I avoided reds like the plague for years.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I can't describe any specific wine or year as I don't keep track and have a bad memory. The upside is that I usually get postively surprised

<br>
<br>
Try Australian Koonunga Hill Chardonnay(dry) or Castle Ridge Colombard Chardonnay(dry) and don't judge the wines by the bottles. There's some that don't look like serious wines at all.
<br>
US Gallo Colombard(semi), Chenin Blanc(semi) and Chardonnay(dry) are good. I dont know about variance in vintages but generally they've been nice.
<br>
Chilean Caliterra Chardonnay(dry) is good but varies a lot.
<br>
Spanish Raimat Chardonnay(dry) and Los Molinos(dry)
<br>
South Arfican whites have been good. Try McGregor Coombard(dry)
<br>
French Chablis is usually good. Try La Jouchere(dry) or Grand Cru Les Preuses(dry)
<br>
For a dessert wine try Hungarian Tokaji Aszu 4, 5 or 6. Very sweet.
<br>
Or if you've got huge amounts of free money Chateau D'Yquem.
<br>
<br>
Geman whites are good as well but I don't know any from experience.
<br>
The opnes above I selected have a good price/quality quot.
<br>
Of course a word of warning. My taste in wines is somewhat eccentric so you may not agree.

<section>
Jiola, thank you!  I will try some of your suggestions.
<br>
<br>
Fallenangel . . . I like red wine enough to "cheat" a few times a year and accept the consequences!  Unfortunately, however, red wine is very bad for people who have certain skin conditions (like rosacea).  And I am vain enough to want to be pretty . . . so I will avoid the red wine as much as I can, saving my "slips" for special occasions.
<br>
<br>
But the dark beer suggestion is interesting  . . . if I drink beer at all I go for a thick Guinness.  Thanks!

As dark beers go Guinness is my choice number 1 but Young's Oatmeal Stout is almost as good. Both need a bit of getting used to.
<br>
Staropramen, Velkopopovicky Kozel and Krusovice Musketyr from the Czheck(sp?) Republic
<br>
Bass Pale Ale or Ruddle's County if you like hops (UK by the way).

Primary question: have you consulted with any good "alternative" practitionrers?
<br>
<br>
Listening to Dr. Paul Pearsall last night on Art Bell, I heard him say that physicians are right 4 out of 10 times.  Also, consider a blood relative you know who has survived to an advanced age.  What diet habits did they have?  Odds are it wasn't the low-fat yadayada thing.  Take a look at the Weston A. Price Foundation website.  Dr. John Lee has much to say also, esspecially for women.

Actually I'd be curious to hear what a Chinese Medicine practicioner would have to say about rosacea.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, if longevity were where I was going here, I'd keep drinking the wine for its health benefits.  However, what's motivating me here right now is pure vanity.  What's the point of living to 100 if my face frightens small children?

Well Halloween is coming up soon, so you might want to wait a few months before you stop drinking it. Halloween is a good time to scare small children.

Doctors and health experts are forever coming up with longer lists of the things that will kill you or turn you into a strange hairy green little wart if you eat them, then a few years later they backflip saying "no this is good and that is bad"
<br>
<br>
We've got a top nutritionalist here in Australia called Rosemary Stanton, who has ALWAYS advocated eating and drinking pretty much what you want, as long as it's all in moderation and not too much of any one thing. She often flies in the face of "popular nutritional opinion" but in the end, she's usually the one that ends up saying "I told you so".
<br>
<br>
As to keeping your good looks Tisha, has your doctor actually properly identified things that you might be reacting to or is he/she still just poking and proodding?

Apparently, everything inflames rosacea sufferers.  Wind, water, sun, stress, along with the aforementioned foods.  It's basically an inflammatory problem.
<br>
<br>
I've got extremetly sensitive skin.  Even rub my hand over my chest or neck, and a red welt is left behind.  My boyfriend had to learn how to not feel guilty from touching me.  I guess I'm just a sensitive person
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_shy.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_shy.gif" border=0&gt;  Even emotionally sensitive (that's why I'm mostly a hermit at home, and closed-off at work).  I deal best with cats, dogs, plants, and fish.  To me, most people are like bulls crashing in a china shop, and all I can think when I'm in a public place is "DUCK!"
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I've been researching Western healthy-skin diets, AND Chinese medicine, and they basically say the same thing.  (Fancy that!)  Here it is:  Foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidant foods, especially greens.  Folks that means fish, berries, and salad!!!!!  The very thing Mr. Trendy (Dr. Perricone, who wrote the Wrinkle Cure) is hawking as the miracle anti-wrinkle diet on TV.
<br>
<br>
There it is, folks:  FISH, BERRIES, FRUITS, VEGGIES, WATER.  No starch, no refined sugars. No booze.  One of the side effects of this diet is that people who eat this stuff tend to lose weight.  Hey!
<br>
<br>
I'm still going to have the occasional glass of wine and suffer the consequences, I think.  I just won't do it every day anymore.

Tisha, I'm sad to hear that you're suffering from rosacea
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_sad.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_sad.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
I confess I was ignorant of it until you mentioned it, so I did a quick bit of research. Now I realise what a common ailment this is. Another side effect of our wonderful western society and its pollution perhaps?
<br>
<br>
Isn't it funny how western medicine is now making so many "discoveries" regarding healthy eating and treatments that have been known to the chinese and other old civilisations for hundreds - thousands of years. Nice to see we're catching up!
<br>
<br>
I really do hope you find something that helps keep this away (especially if it's inexpensive). I imagine all the "new and effective" treatments cost a fortune.
<br>
<br>
On the brighter side, though boring, your rather necessary diet must be keeping you fit &amp; healthy. Nutritionists over hear can't stop telling us how important it is to get lots of Omega-3 &amp; antioxidants.
<br>
<br>
I'd love to be able to say something here that would really cheer you up but best I can think of is to send you thoughts of a ((gentle hug))
<br>
<br>
Take care Tisha

You're on the right track with your diet regimen. Not only will a diet like that keep your skin healthy, it will also extend your lifespan and keep away cancer and illness.
<br>
<br>
There was a study called the Okinawa Report which examined the reasons for the remarkable longetivity of the inhabitants of the island. They have more centennarians then any other area of the world. They found a diet high in anti-oxidants, low in calories, combined with moderate exercise (tai chi) and a positive attitude were the main factors in making it to 100.
<br>
<br>
The diet you listed is very close to that, minus the jasmine tea and tofu. I follow the same guidelines in my diet, more for longetivity then rosacea, though I also have that condition. When I drink anything other then pale ales, pilsners, or vodka I get it pretty bad. Guinness and red wine are the worst.
<br>
I thik there's a connection between the malt or yeast content and how red you get.
<br>
<br>
You mentioned being into TCM. Have you looked into schizandra? From what I've read it is supposed to give a person beautiful skin, besides being a powerful adaptogen. Lycium is another herb for that purpose. One site said lycium would give you skin like porcelin, which would probably look interesting (or scary...). Anti-inflammatory herbs might help for skin flushing.
<br>
<br>

Just as a one up, you might like to try Omega-3 as a supplement. There are a few good books on the subject and myself and a few others in my family have begun taking daily Omega-3 and you can visibly see the difference. I reccomend it to anyone.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for wine, I personally favor a good pinot noir, and I reccomend any wine lovers check out some NZ wines, there are some fantastic ones, though I dont doubt theyre much more expensive overseas.
