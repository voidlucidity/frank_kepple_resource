<section>
Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the board: I have just projected! [^]
<br>
<br>
I am having a hard time describing this in words, but it goes like this:
<br>
I had formed a big intent to manage WILD this night. The time was about 1 o'clock in the morning. I laid on my back, relaxing my whole body. I tried creating dreampictures of the location I wanted to appear in when I started dreaming. I was trying intensely, but it did not work. I was extremely tempted to just roll over to my side and go to sleep, but for some reason I kept trying, again and again. I got away from my intention of trying WILD, and got the idea that I might try projecting AGAIN.
<br>
I tried "conscious shifting" about the room, I tried feeling myself above my body, I tried the techniqe called ROPE. I do not know for sure, but I think I slipped of it and started dozing of. I got this feeling of getting really obese! Like I was getting blown up like a balloon. I remembered this feeling, but could not establish where I had felt it before(It felt so normal!). Suddenly these vibrations started and a sound followed closely. The vibrations rushed with enormous power through me, and the sound was extremely loud(a motor-sound kind of, but it may be on closer look be like my ears was vibrating). This feeling of vibrations and sounds were so enormous, but I stayed calm and allowed them to do their thing. The vibrations and sound came and went with different power, but they did not dissapear until it finally happened. The vibrations stopped, and I tried moving physically, but instead I moved my real-time body!.
<br>
I felt myself moving through my bedcovers. I looked down upon my legs. They were in a strange "color" I can not properly describe(black,white,gold,living,purple,moving,orange,yellow). I got up not sure if I were floating or standing(I could not feel my legs). I was in my room, and it was dark(like it was in the physical). I could see everything perfectly. I was "alone", I was "it" I was "me", not dependant on my physical body. I had a total different view and I did not feel conected to my physical body.I wanted to go out my door and tell everyone    in the house that I made it, but I remembered Robert Bruce's advise about keeping the first ones very short.
<br>
So I laid back down in my bed and started trying to move physically. I eventually managed to move and I woke up. It took me about 1-2 minutes to find a paper to record this on. I was so exited! It was so real! No loss of consciousness in between or anything, I just got out!
<br>
I started recording at 02:46 and ended recording at 02:57, I filled in the rest this morning.
<br>
<br>
Aftermath:
<br>
It was nothing like expected!  I did not expect vibrations, I did not expect dark vision, I did not expect projection, I did not expect the strange color of my body, I did not expect all the sensations, I did not expect such a "aha!" feeling of remembering, I did not expect such joy after completion,I did not expect to just get my sight    like it had always been there, I did not expect feeling so independant, so alone, such a feeling of "it"/"me". I was all so amazing and seems so unreal, but still I    know that it is real and that I actually went outside my body! And I know I can do it again!
<br>
<br>
I cannot explain this in words, all of this seems so far off from the actual experience, but it's the best I can do at the time being!
<br>
The thing I am most exited about(strangely enough) is the vibrations and the motor-sound I got. They were so enormous, so powerful! Such a great feeling! If I did not know they were harmless I would have just died right there of heart-attack or something! [|)]
<br>
I guess I was "out" about two minutes or so, perhaps less.
<br>
<br>
I have a feeling of immense joy and happiness! I have just made my first(?) conscious projection and it is BREATHTAKING!!! Thank you everyone at the forum, thank you all my OBE-seeking friends, thank you Robert Bruce and thank you "God"! [

Well done.
<br>
<br>
And the great thing is, all the wonderful feelings and incredible sensations you felt are just the tip of a huge iceberg of experiences still to come. Just wait until you are entering the Astral from flying through some kind of entrance structure. The experience is simply mind blowing.

<br>
What amazed me about my first time in the RTZ was just how REAL it felt!!!!!!!  And you pegged the vibrations just right.  They're so profound, they can't be missed or confused with anything else.
<br>
<br>
I have a question - - - when you tried to move, was it difficult, or did it hurt?  Sometimes I wonder if I'm trying to move too soon, if I should just chill out and wait.

Hello everyone!
<br>
Thanks for the huge response to my "little" experience! It really warms my little newly found astral heart! [

In reply to the questions asked:
<br>
-Tisha
<br>
When I moved my rtz-body straight after exit I felt like moving my physical body, only i did not strain a single muscle. I moved with ease and it most certainly did not hurt [^]
<br>
However if you are referring to the wake-up process, I did have serious problems moving my physical body. It would not respond, and when I finally managed to move my arm it was extremely heavy! No feeling of pain though. Hope this answeres the question!
<br>
<br>
-Lasher
<br>
Well this requires a bit of a long answer. Last weekend I read Astral Dynamics(by RB, offcourse). This was a very informative and exiting book, and it gave me a lot of new ideas and sure gave me quite a much stronger "I want to do this!"-feeling. What I did different this time was this: During the day I took a nap(a thing I normally don't do) and I stayed up very late(watching a movie). All the relaxing during the day made my body easily relaxed as well as I felt a bit tired, allthough I could stay awake without straining myself. Now here comes the part that I think really made the difference: I usually try untill I get really "fed up", then I turn around and go to sleep. However this time I did not give up. I tried so hard so long that I wanted to give up several times, but I said to myself "No way, come hell or high water..I WILL PROJECT!!" I kept trying and trying to a point where I think I just "stopped thinking"(This has been added after I originally posted:"Often I'll experience a little lapse in consciousness immediately prior to the vibrational state" Frank said this in a thread I just read, and that could explain why I am not sure what I did just before the vibrations kicked in). I was just lying there when the huge vibrations came rushing over me(I must say once more: It was awesome!).
<br>
And then there is the possability that I might have projected before, but forgot upon returning to my body(this could explain why I remembered the "balloon-feeling"). This is explained in Astral Dynamics(shadow-memory, failed memory download).
<br>
I hope this should answer this question as well.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the kind congratulations again, it really means something to me! [|)]

Hello lads!
<br>
<br>
In reply to Tao's question: This is a hard question to answer really. I have never deliberately induced the vibrations. However when I first got them my "first time"(?), I kind of rememered everything, starting at the feeling of getting "ballooned" to the vibrations and sound. I do not know why exactly. This si the best answer I can give you at this time.

I have been trying, more or less active half a year I suppose. Thant means I have only tried a few times, but read a lot, and did mediation-practices etc.

Thanks for the extra info, TS.  Every bit helps.  I can definitely relate to the part about getting fed up or tired of trying and then rolling over and going to sleep.  It's encouraging to know that pushing through this may be the key to success.

That was an interesting report TruthSeeker.
<br>
Such a short experince yet SO Profound. [:O]
<br>
Now that you have experienced the 'other side' you can see why it is so difficult describing that experience to people who have not yet had a projection. An analogy is describing color to a blind person or music to a deaf person. Words cannot do an ineffable experience justice. Your report was noteworthy in that you mentioned the difficulty of translating an out of body experience into (mundane) language. Thanx for sharing. [8D]

Hello TruthSeeker. I keep on trying and trying, and hopefully i will succed. Another thing i do everyday, is make some afirmation and meditate while i say them in my mind, and imagin it happen. I had try it for a week. Maybe if i had fail during and "AP" atempt, it can be very frustrated. Then the afirmation  change my mind from negative to positive. I use 10 different afirmation. I use about 2 min on each.

<section>
Truthseeker,
<br>
Congratulations on your OBE! I envy you!
<br>
<br>
I am also a "newbie" to this process and have also just experienced my first OBE. Only mine was spontaneous, I was awake and standing up. I had gone to the bathroom for a sunburn remedy and was looking in the mirror, not really happy with what I was seeing. Then, just instantaneously, "I" was behind my body, looking at myself. My vision was perfectly normal. I had no sensation of movement, no vibrations, etc., it just happened. "I" said/thought "It's just a biological machine, you know.", like I would comment on the weather. Then "I" realized what had happened and an "ALERT" jolt hit me. As quickly as that occurred I was back in my body. This all could not have taken more than a few seconds, but it was AWESOME! I am only exasperated that I couldn't have reacted more calmly -- I think getting excited or alarmed must shut it down.
<br>
<br>
Like you said in an earlier post, I believe what I can prove. So now I know this stuff can really happen. That's pretty encouraging!
<br>
<br>
Take care and have fun!

<section>
I'm afraid, if you want to achieve an obe, you need more then an 'I will try it someday'-attitude... Unless you're ofcourse a natural born talent.
<br>
<br>
If you read through the posts on this forum you will find out why. Anyway, I wish you all the best!

Thank for posting your first OBE. I've been trying a very long time for that first one, and your experience could explain the reason behind my lack of success.
<br>
<br>
I very often reach the stage where I am just bored, fet up, or too tired and I give up.
<br>
<br>
QUOTE: ""...but for some reason I kept trying, again and again""
<br>
<br>
Your determination did it. I work at this every day, sometimes twice a day, but I stop, after around 40 minutes to an hour, of trying.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing.

Congrats TS!
<br>
<br>
Hey when ever I get into a trance with those vibs I do not get a sound. Any reason for that?
<br>
<br>
Also when I am in the trance do I move my body *what I think is my physical* and I would AP? Please explain the moving.

Dear corvette,
<br>
<br>
Not everyone expeiences the same "exit-sensations" whn they exit the physical. So this is not a necessity to having an OBE(referring to the sounds).
<br>
When it comes to movement:
<br>
At this particular projection I moved because I KNEW I was outside my body(I floated upwards, saw my etheric body). So what I did was to move like I would in the physical, I moved by thought somehow. I floated where I wanted to float, I do not know exactly how I did it, but it felt natural.
<br>
In other cases when you feel exit-sensations(vibrations, floating limbs etc.) You simply try moving. You might find yourself out of body(the feeling of not moving a muscle to move will accompany it), or you might still be in the physical. If you are infact in the physical, simply lay down and try again.
<br>
I advise you to do a realitycheck either way, as you might be in another vehicle(etheric vehicle) without feeling any "astral feelings". Do a simple check by looking at a text or watching your hands(if the text changes, or your hands looks strange or start melting you are in the astral place called "The RealTime Zone", "RTZ".
<br>
<br>
Good luck,
<br>
<br>

the swelling you feel, do you have a reference point when you are "out" to compare your astral body size to your human size? I expand about 3 times my bodie's size when i am "out".  When i come back in, i am aware of how much i have to squeeze down to fit back into my body. It seems something like a disapointment to have to be crammed in here, but it's natural. you are right on about the sounds and vibration, though lately, i blow right past the exit signs and just expand and leave.
