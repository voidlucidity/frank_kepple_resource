Hey, is it like, ok if you were a pro at astral projecting, both you and your friend, and then one night, you 2 decide you wanna switch bodies for a day... (me be in their body, them in my body) is it possible? Are there any dangers of being stuck that way? *by the way, I'm a girl hes a guy... no nothing suggestive about it, he just is really curious about what its like to be a girl and myself.. whats it like to be a guy ahaha*
<br>
<br>
And... any advise on how to astral project is welcome too =P

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You cannot switch bodies, not in a literal physical sense as you will both have a different bio-energetic signature. You can merge with your other focuses as the energetic signature is developed from the same Primary Essence. Well, thinking about it, if your man is a parallel focus then you could merge with his physical. Not impossible, but in sheer statistical terms the chances of your man being a parallel focus is rather slight.
<br>

Yours,

How can one know if my friend is a "parallel focus"?
