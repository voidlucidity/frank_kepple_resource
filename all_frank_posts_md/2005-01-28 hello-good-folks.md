Hello, Everyone..
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
When I heard about Robert, I immediately found his interviews and listened with so much interest I didn't want to be interrupted by anybody.  Thanks so much for making this site available.
<br>
<br>
Twenty years ago a small group of ladies formed a prayer group for our church which was in distress.  Not too long thereafter while we were in the middle of a meeting, a gentleman walked in the door whom none of us had ever seen before and exclaimed,  "I'm the one for whom you've been praying."  Next, he began to explain the nature of our prayers, although we had no way of knowing how he knew what they were.
<br>
<br>
A few weeks after this, each of the ladies in the group fell under traumatic psychological/spiritual attacks.  Included in this were:
<br>
<br>
Electrical appliances began to turn on by themselves around my house.
<br>
Objects began to move in my classroom, and the students saw this.
<br>
His face appeared each night at 2:30 in the bedroom of one lady.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most phenomenal experience, however, involves me being knocked across my kitchen by some kind of invisible force.  At the time I was in his presence and asked, "How can you tell if a person is Satanic?" - Upon asking this question I was hit - "wham" and he said "That's a no-no to ask that -  I take care of you and your husband."
<br>
<br>
This really made no sense to me.
<br>
<br>
I was traumatized by the experience.  One lady wound up in a mental institution.  As a result (as you might imagine) I''ve been curious to this day.
<br>
<br>
How could all this happen?  Is it possible that this person was a human, but satanic.  Might  there have been negs involved?.  Can you think of any explanation?

Hi GoldShoes,
<br>
<br>
First off, welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I hope you'll like participating and meeting other members here.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the events that you described and the question that you asked I would recommend a couple of things. Try a post in the forum entitled:
<b>
 <i>
  Welcome to Robert Bruce Questions &amp; Answers
 </i>
</b>
. Robert stops by from time to time and should respond.
<br>
<br>
Also, we have a moderator here named: Nita, and she would be the best moderator to ask about what you've stated. Try posting in the
<b>
 <i>
  Welcome to Psychic Self Defense
 </i>
</b>
forum and/or sending a private message (PM) to Nita.
<br>
<br>
All the best, and again, welcome,
<br>
Nick

Hi Nick,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for responding and the advice.  I'll follow it in order to have some closure.
<br>
<br>
I've only touched the tip of the iceberg.
<br>
<br>
Id' be so honored to be able to communicate with Robert Bruce,but it  would take a while to organize my thoughts.  (nervous, probably)
<br>
<br>
A private message would  be in order.  I say this because before there was relief, the FBI, HEW, local law enforcement officers, and the governor of the state became involved.
<br>
<br>
The one thing I do want to emphasize is that I don't want to find this individual, know where he is, or what has happened to him, or ever communicate with him or anybody involved in this activity.  It's ony for personal understanding.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the welcome.  I'd love to meet and participate with other members.
<br>
<br>
Have a great week-end,
<br>
Gold Shoes

GoldShoes I'd like to say welcome to the Astral Pulse forums too .
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce has an excellent book about negs and protection from them called :
<br>
<br>
Practical Psychic Self-Defense: Understanding and Surviving Unseen Influences:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1571742212/ref%3Dpd%5Fsxp%5Felt%5Fl1/104-8158345-7777543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
<br>
I suggest that you order the book and  read it and consult Robert Bruce  too . He is very kind about answering these questions and giving expert advice on defense.  You have come to the right place . I think that events like the ones you described are always better shared with experts and privately .
<br>
<br>
Here is a little bit of immediate info on protection :

<br>
I you wish to engage in the construct of psychic attack we have an excellent PSD forum I'm sure you will enjoy. You'll meet lots of people there who are being attacked in all manner of ways, so you should have a lot of fun.

Hi Aunt Clair,
<br>
<br>
May I express genuine thanks for your message and advice? You're very considerate.
<br>
<br>
I've ordered the book, and I'm sure that I will just absorb every word.  I read your article on protection.
<br>
It's quite helpful.  I intend to write Robert when I have a time of quietness.
<br>
<br>
It appears that we all had something very serious here and weren't prepared at all.
<br>
<br>
God's Light and Love,

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the welcome.  I can't imagine how anybody wouldn't just love the forums.  I do!!
<br>
<br>
Perhaps others here and I can find a somewhat lighter side to these things.  That's a very good coping skill.
<br>
<br>
You're appreciated.  Have a great day!

Welcome to the forums!
<br>
I do not think that it was a Satanist, spiritual Satanists are not evil at all, so attack from such person would not be started without reason. The same with demons. I think that a very powerful neg have been involved, from my experiences when negs possess people, they can send incredible amounts of hate into that person and control him/her almost absolutely.
<br>
When a person is possessed, neg slowly merges with him/her, and person's nature becomes  purely evil.

Hello,
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All these ladies are quite gentle and never became filled with any hate or evil even when attacked.  We are taught to practice harmlessness to all creatures great and small.
<br>
<br>
Negativity will surely return to the person that sends it out.  It may manifest many times greater at that point toward the one who sent it.  I think all these ladies believe this.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your comments.  Have a great day!

If that's so, then it's a work of a neg. When people are controlled by them they can do horrible things. Negativity will of course return, but will it help this person learn anything?

<section>
Hopefully, the person will be introspective and able to analyze  their mistakes.  That learning promotes progress individually and ultimately to the whole.
<br>
<br>
It should be rather easy just to say, "Wow, I really messed up."  Sadly, the attitude of many is "my way or hit the highway."
<br>
<br>
I was able to be with Sylvia Brown during a time, and if I remember correctly, her attitude was there just were some that you couldn't help.
<br>
<br>
Guess that's when you just "shake the dust off your feet" and go on down the road.
