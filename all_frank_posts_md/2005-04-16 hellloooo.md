<section>
This site was sent to me by a friend of mine -  graelwyn and I'm so glad she did!
<br>
<br>
I have been trying to find like minds on this subject for so long, and all along, here you are!
<br>
<br>
A bit about myself, I'm just 30 ( gawd that's a painful thing to admit!) and have had many varying experiences of OBE's/Astral Projection.  ( I like to think that OBE's are spontaneous where as astral is the ability to leave your body at will)
<br>
<br>
To begin with they were very scary and I thought I was going mad, I guess this brought me in to spiritualism more than anything as I have lost my "seeing" ability but now sensing.
<br>
<br>
A few years ago, I tried very hard to use the techniques given by Robert Bruce, but I couldn't push my fear away

<br>
<br>
Now I have had many changes in my life and I have found that I am able to leave my body fully conscious and control the "bad" things but after that, I'm dead nonchalant, and like, yeah, whateva! lol
<br>
<br>
I am being taught lots of lessons on the astral plane and have talked to many other astral travellers.
<br>
<br>
My biggest problem is that I seem inattentive, like a brain error or something, once I finally join the astral plane.  Sometimes I know I have learned something but don't know what, others I'm able to describe things in fantastic detail.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that this site will give me some advice on things and can share my experiences with and learn from you guys.
<br>
<br>
So here I am and thanks for letting me join this site!
<br>
<br>
Sorry, I don't half go on don't I?
<br>
lol
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
