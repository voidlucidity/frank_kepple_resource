Hi kalen,
<br>
<br>
Check out the book
<i>
 Astral Dynamics
</i>
by Robert Bruce. You can also visit his website and download his treatise on out of body experiences. There is a lot of information with respect to techniques and exercises in the book and also in the website downloads.
<br>
<br>
The link to his website is:

Very best,

As a follow-up, I thought that you might want to search for the websites of Robert Peterson and William Buhlman. There should be articles to read at their sites. Also, I believe that Robert Peterson's OBE book is online, and you can read it for free there if money is an issue for you. Just try a Google search and I'm sure you'll come up with the websites.

There is quite a bit of info on the main page of this BBS. Plus, you may find the search function useful.
