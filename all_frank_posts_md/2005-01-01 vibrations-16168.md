I feel like a failure. I get the vibrations and i balanced my emotions,
<br>
but then the vibrations disappear and i feel extremely light, but i still feel like i am on my bed. I open my eyes and i am on my bed. Is it possible I am astro projecting but still thinking i am in my normal state? Help. I have been trying every method except counting breaths, and imagining i am floating. Should i try that? I have been trying this for a couple weeks, and all i got was vibrations and strong, and powerful  sensation. Thanks in advanced!

The OBEs that I have had have mostly all been through lucid dreaming(although I am working on doing it from meditation) have you tried that?  It sounds like you are raising energy so maybe the only thing missing is your physical body being asleep enough.

Because there is not much to say towards your thread...it is a matter of try, try again.  Ya know?  You are right there!  Don't let doubt filter in, that will cause a immediate stop.

I can't agree more with what Nay has said. Last Sunday night (2/1/05) I had my first 'vibrations' that kicked in after I kept my mind awake whilst my body was asleep. This has taken less than a month to do and I know that it will only be a matter of time before I will be able to have a full astral projection, but even if it's a year or two down the line I won't mind as I realise it takes time and as they say "Rome wasn't built in a day". Keep it up and not before long you will progress. As I said before, I have only just begun taking a real interest and reading up about OBEs/meditation/NEW techniques within the past month and can easily be regarded as a complete 'rookie' but I know that with a little practice I will progress well, as you also will. So keep it up and don't lose faith.

I have been trying for quite some time too, and yes, it can be discouraging. I have yet to succeed myself after a couple of years. There is something I would like to point out, however. I don't believe anyone is a rookie or newbie or whatever other label you want to attach to a "first timer". According to the seasoned pros, we all project while asleep, we just are not aware of it. Its just a matter of recreating the process while being aware of it. We are all pros at it. Its just some of us don't know it yet.

The important thing is to watch and wait for signs that you are making progress, no matter how small they may be at first. This allows you to be happy about them, to continue to think about them, and in general to encourage more of the same. You can be sure I've been kicking myself for not recognizing progress just because it wasn't what I was looking for at the time it came to me.

It is a bit of an understatement to say that I had a lot of learning to do, but things are finally moving along in the right direction. It was necessary to stop reading menus and to start tasting the food which was right in front of me the whole time.
