hey, wether we're doomed now or in a thousand yers when the sun goes supernova, we're still doomed. wether it's now or when we finally drive one too many species and plants into extinction, we're doomed. wether it's now or when you personally die, you will still die. we are all 'doomed.'
<br>
<br>
that being said.... damn.

It says it is from the BBC, but I cannot find anything about it on the actual BBC site. If anyone can find a reputable source with this information I will believe it. Otherwise my opinion that it is a nice forgery stands.

No wonder the coalition forces are starting to meet tough resistance. The republican guard are in fact all Jaffar.

LOL!
<br>
<br>
You know, I recognize that "stargate" from a scene in SG1!  C'mon people, don't be so gullable.  If something like that really was announced, it would be ALL OVER the tabloids and the news, we would have seen it on CNN or something.  If the Iraqis really did have that kind of technology, then why would they be using such primitive tactics like they are now...?  You know.. like the suicide bomber that killed 4 G.I.s  That kinda stuff wouldn't be held secret for a second if that were a real announcment.
<br>
<br>
I personally believe only 1st world countries such as US or Britain are rich and suffisticated enough to develope technology such as A-Gravity, Scalar waves, tesla devices. etc.  And I can assure you that they are no where near revealing any of it yet...
<br>
<br>
That page is a good joke though... I would definately get a real kick out of anyone who believes it. [

P.S. you might as well argue that no one ever really landed on the moon, hah!

Ha, ha, ha, I too like a good laugh. Flaming hilarious, especially the Umm-Qasr snip. And the one-liners at the end had me in stitches.

Did you read the article about the US giving the Statue of Liberty back to France because of them not supporting us in the war? Hahahaha! It's pretty good!
