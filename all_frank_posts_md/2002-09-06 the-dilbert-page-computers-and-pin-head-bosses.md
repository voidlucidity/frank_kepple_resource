Hey folks, has this ever happened to you?
<br>
<br>
I arrived at work this morning to find this new tweaky computer on my desk.  It's a Dell, black, kind of neat looking, with a detachable laptop that my co-workers envy because they didn't rate a laptop.
<br>
<br>
How kind of the Navy to care about IT enough to give me the latest and greatest.  But they had to leave my old HP Vectra on my desk for me to use, because what I need to do my work - - - a slow, stupid ORACLE system that doesn't even work right - - - is too archaic to work with my fancy new computer.  The Navy spent so much money and time on this stupid ORACLE  system that they refuse to spend the money and time to migrate to something better.
<br>
<br>
So here I am with two computers on my desk, and no room for anything else, like, my work perhaps?

sounds familiar !!! i just got a shiny black dell lap top aswell, last week....looks very pretty. And a nice black mouse too !
<br>
<br>
Now if only the company would upgrade their systems, I might be able to use my new stuff to its potential !
<br>
<br>
i.e. we are still using an e-mail system from the mid 80's, black screen and green text....all F5 and F6 buttons everywhere...its doing my head in !
<br>
<br>
....just thinking about the posts covering Monroe's "focus" states.....I've just realised that they are all at the top of my keyboard ! F1 thru to F12 !
<br>
<br>
...maybe if I press F10 I'll get straight there, ha ha.....

Actually that could be an interesting way to visualize moving from F1 to F12, imagining yourself pressing the buttons on your keyboard.
<br>
<br>
Of course, it might interfere with your ability to remain focused at work!
<br>
<br>
Ha ha!
