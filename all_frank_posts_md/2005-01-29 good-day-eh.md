Hi!
<br>
<br>
I'm a budding Dream Journalist and Herbologist in my private world, but a regular nine-to-fiver in the public forum.
<br>
<br>
I quite enjoy a good debate but I'm terribly impatient with bad logic and false reasoning.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, happy postings!

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum. If you want to spread some logic and reasoning around here then be my guest, lol.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I know just what you mean, circular logic and similar fallacies bring my nerves to pieces, lol...
<br>
<br>
There are those who practice objectivism here though, so you will thankfully not die of backwards-reasoning overload, should you choose to stay.
<br>
<br>
Welocme!
