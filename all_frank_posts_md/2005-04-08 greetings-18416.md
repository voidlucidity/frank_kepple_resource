<section>
I'm bad at intro topics, but here goes...
<br>
<br>
My name is Timothy, I am 17 years old and am living in the Netherlands.
<br>
<br>
I have always been interested in the spiritual but mostly only did reading.
<br>
Lately, I've been stuck between the material and the spiritual world, so to speak, and I don't really know what to do.
<br>
<br>
There's nothing I'd love to do more than devote my life studying the spiritual and things like the face on Mars (What is it really, how did it get there, etc) and many other such things. But I'm afraid following my heart will make things even worse for my mother, who has enough things on her mind as it is already. But doing what my mother would like me to do will not only make me unhappy, as I can not do what I truly want to do, it'll also force me to participate in a society which, in my opinion, is so corrupted and led astray it makes every part of my being cry. I cannot even stand watching the news anymore these days: so much hate... so much destruction... so much deception... so many lies... It's more than I can handle.
<br>
Of course, I realize not all is lost just yet, and I want to help people realize there's more to life than just money.
<br>
<br>
But in order to do that, I have to learn. A lot.
<br>
I've always been empathic and I've had several experiences with the spiritual, like sensing my grandfather's presence in my room just days after he passed on to the next part of life, but I have never developed my abilities because I was too afraid I'd make people around me worry.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, enough bothering you with my mindless rambling.
<br>
I will probably not post much because I simply do not understand enough yet and probably will only make myself look bad, but I'll read a lot and try to learn.
<br>
<br>
So... yeah, that's basically who I am.
<br>
<br>
Nice meeting you all.
