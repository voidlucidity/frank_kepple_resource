UK members will appreciate this. Other nationalities substitute your own pet town or state in place of "Essex".
<br>
<br>
A trucker in Essex stops for a red light and a blonde catches up, jumps out of her car, runs up to his truck, and knocks on the door. The trucker lowers the window and she says, "Hi, my name is Heather and you are losing some of your load."
<br>
<br>
The trucker ignores her and proceeds down the street. Soon the truck stops at another red light and the girl once again catches up. She jumps out of her car, runs up and knocks on the truck door. Again, the trucker lowers the window and, as if they've never spoken, the blonde says brightly, "Hi, my name is Heather, and you are definitely losing some of your load!"
<br>
<br>
Shaking his head, the trucker ignores her again and continues down the street. At the third red light, the same thing happens. All out of breath, she gets out of her car, runs up to the truck and hammers on the door. The trucker lowers the window and again she says "Hi, my name is Heather, and you are still losing some of your load!"
<br>
<br>
When the light turns green, the trucker revs up and races to the next light. When he stops this time, he hurriedly gets out of the truck, and runs back to the blonde. He knocks on her window and, as she lowers it, he shouts, "Hi, my name is Wayne and I'm driving a flaming gritter!"
<br>

I'll admit my ignorance in the hope that it will be corrected. What is a flaming gritter and why would it look like it was falling off the truck without that being a problem? And why would the Heather in the story not see the real situation right away?

Really, I am being serious. I want to know what a flaming gritter is. The joke is lacking something without this explanation. I think that if this could be explained the other questions would be answered as well.

Okay, "flaming" is a mild English swear word. Sort of like fvck but nowhere near as bad. And a "gritter" is one of those lorries that spreads grit on the roads in order to combat icy conditions. As for the definition of "Essex girl" well, I don't have flame-proof enough overalls to explain that to you, Tom.

Thanks for the explanation. I re-read the joke. Now I will go think about it for a while. In time, it is possible that I will fully understand this joke.

I am like Tom...I had no idea what a gritter was! I knew flaming already though. We have nothing at all like that over here in West Oz and frankly I never even knew they existed....but I did get a chuckle when I read what a gritter was!

Flame proof overalls?  What are those?

Okay so I'm a blonde.  So what.

Except for Monty Python I never could understand english humor. Tisha must know a good blonde joke or 2? Unfortunately i haven't heard any balding dark haird men with ponytales  jokes lately.

My favorite blonde joke is actually a comic strip I saw years ago.  A blonde woman was standing at the ubiquitous water cooler with a male coworker.  Beneath, the caption was of her saying:
<br>
<br>
"Dumb blonde jokes don't bother me, because I know I'm not a real blonde."

Hi Tom,
<br>
You're funny ... you make me chuckle!  Thanks.  I don't know if you were still being serious or trying to be funny ... perhaps a little of both!
<br>
<br>
The US equivilant of "flaming" would be "fricking" ... used in such phrases as "frickin' butt-munch."
<br>
<br>
I too had no idea what a "gritter" is ... it ended up being a "frickin' salt truck" (sand for some of you)!  LOL!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the English humor, Frank!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

Ideas on the Essex Girl theme:
<br>
<br>
An Essex girl was in a bad car accident. Paramedics arrive to see her dazed and staggering around the central reservation covered in blood.
<br>
<br>
"Where are you bleeding from?" asked a paramedic.
<br>
<br>
"Fackin' Chelmsford" the Essex girl replies.
<br>
