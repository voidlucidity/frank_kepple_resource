<br>
A lawyer from New York was transfered to a small frontier town during the settlement of the West. After several weeks he noticed that the town was populated solely by men.
<br>
<br>
He asked one of the local cowboys, "What do you do when you get the urge for a woman?"
<br>
<br>
The cowboy replied, "See them thar' sheep on that there hill. We just go git us one."
<br>
<br>
"That is disgusting and barbaric!" replied the lawyer.
<br>
<br>
After about 3 months, however, the lawyer became frustrated to the point where he couldn't stand it any longer. He decided though, if he was going to do a sheep, he would show these yokels how to do it right.
<br>
<br>
He picked out the prettiest sheep of the bunch; bathed her; put a pink ribbon on her; served her hay on a china plate; dressed her in fine lingerie... and then took the sheep to bed.
<br>
<br>
After he finished he decided to take his new found lover out for a drink. He wandered into the local saloon with the sheep under his arm: instantly, the piano fell silent; people dropped drinks; and all the cowboys turned and stared in shocked disbelief.
<br>
<br>
"You bunch of hypocrites!" shouted the lawyer, "You look at me as if I'm some sort of freak for doing what you all have been doing. Only I'm doing it with more class."
<br>
<br>
"That ain't the problem," replied one cowboy. "That's the sheriff's gal you're with."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh well, I laughed.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

It sounded like it was going to be a variation on another joke I heard. It does not involve sheep, but instead a barrel with a hole cut into the side. The new guy was introduced to the barrel and he said he liked it so much he said he would go to the barrel every day. He was told that it was going to be his turn to be inside the barrel soon.
