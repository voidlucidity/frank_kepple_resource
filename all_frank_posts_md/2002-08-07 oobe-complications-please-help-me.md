Okay, I cut/pasted this from a document I wrote it up in earlier today. For those that consider replying, thankyou for your support and guidance.

Summary: A progress report:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chakra Meditation: I did some today.
<br>
<br>
Altered State of Consciousness: Unable to achieve the falling sensation. Whenever I do this, the extent of my practices only allow me to relax my muscles to some extent. I find that I am rarely able to induce the sensation of having my head feel like it's been put in a box, and that I am never able to induce the state of falling.
<br>
<br>
Summary of my Attempt: I tense up my muscles. I infer that they are minimally relaxed, but not to a sufficient level that would be required. I look up at the ceiling, staring blankly as I breathe in and breathe out. I find that this does absolutely nothing. I then close my eyes. My body itches, but I ignore those sensations. Thoughts begin to form, but before I can contemplate, I push them away. The most I get is a single word or the first second of a tune before I abolish it. These thoughts are not on my surface mind; rather, they linger in the background almost like floating thoughts. I endeavor, breathing in and out a bit. Moments later, I move to the next stage: altered state of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Robert claims that one can achieve such a state through the sensation of falling. However, I have realized over the years that this merely brings about added complications.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1)       I have observed that whenever I lie down, close my eyes, and attempt to allow myself to fall, my point of focus shifts to another angle, or direction. Usually, I attempt to put pressure on my solo-plexus or chest area. I never put pressure at my head area or at any area along my lower torso. Yet, my focus begins to change—periodically. I'll be focusing entirely on my chest, putting pressure down on it and induce a falling sensation—then my focus will change without warning and I'll be observing myself in third person from an angle diagonal left or right from my head. I must note that this occurs frequently and is the result of automation, and/or personal attempts to realign my focus so as I can attempt to induce an altered state with better success
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2)       I have observed that my face / head are never truly relaxed. When I try and induce an altered state, my body—particularly my arms and legs—become relaxed, though never extensively to the point where I am no longer aware of them. I question if there is a method to get around this or whether or not my face need be numb—regardless of what I have said, I realize the complication of the fact that when I've achieved vibrations in the fast, I have experienced complications around my face area that have hindered my progress entirely—problems which I will explain below.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3)       When I lay with my mouth open, the inside of my mouth becomes dry... and this itself is a distraction. Naturally, I swallow. It is a concern because it means that I am continuously aware of my head area regardless of how relaxed I may be.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4)       Often, my eyes go R.E.M., moving about randomly and twitching.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5)       I find that there is no special difficulty in the early stage of an attempt to induce an altered state, yet as I endeavor into it, I find that I am unable to push my body down and I begin to maintain a stationary position—and if I push, it almost does nothing. It is not a matter of concentration, I believe—or perhaps it is—but rather a matter of visual/tactile strength (?). Well, I'm not entirely sure, perhaps you know.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6)       Whenever I try climbing the rope, I tend to have a hard time. I find that by reading your treastie, it sounds easy and well done in theory, but in practice is rather vague and unspecified. What exactly is meant by tactile imaging? I recognize the fact that one does not have to visualize. But that is where the problem begins for me. I find that I cannot tactile image at all and that I tend to visualize—and this is part of the complications I experience. When I attempt to climb the rope, I usually have a passive attitude. When I climb it, I tend to naturally imagine a rope. Unfortunately, as I climb it, my hands slip and I can never maintain a grip. When I have a grip and I climb it, I never feel myself rise. I have a hard enough time trying to feel my body rising up with the rope. I guess I should go into detail with the different methods of climbing the rope I've attempted:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7)       Method #1. This is more of the conventional method for me. I attempt to climb, but my hands always slip. I can never maintain a good grip. I always seem to visualize these hands, and the rope itself, and myself climbing up it. There is never detail, more or less the figure itself. Sometimes it's awkward when I go to put my hands around the rope. This is because my hand is sometimes backwards (twisted around) when it should in fact be the other way. Often, I find that when I climb the rope I only grab it with my thumb and another finger (a two finger grab). More or less, this is rather confusing for me. This, in combination with my other complications, makes for a hefty problem for me.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
Method #2. I don't imagine a rope at all. In fact, I don't even use my "imaginary hands" instead, I do this: feel myself being pulled up by a rope. I rise and I rise a bit... then I my focus changes (either on purpose or not on purpose) or I lose interest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9)       A variation of the above method is that I have my focus positioned almost as if I were looking straight in front. I take my hands and just endeavor the rope as if I were opening a gate really fast (using those chains). In this method, I don't induce the rising sensation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10)    The other method which I found works best is this: I perform method #1, except I put tons of focus into it and have a more aggressive attitude, just grab and trying to climb the rope as fast as I can. With each reach, I usually reach out as far as possible. As with #1, I experience the slipping effect as my hand slips down the rope bringing about wasted effort, frustration, and sometimes desperation. However, I tend to experience greater complications. Sometimes the rope has knots in it, which stop the slip; sometimes there's something else. What has recently frustrated me is that the focus for the rope's position changes continuously so that although it is (now) positioned over my head, the rope is diagonally slanted so that I'm pulling on it from an angle. Sometimes, the rope bends and swings... I will admit that it is almost never stationary... ever.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I find my body tends to tense automatically... numerous times have I blown a projection simply because I've been tricked into thinking I was leaving my body when in reality, my body muscles had reacted by raising themselves up (curving my body up). The same occurs with other muscles—particularly my thigh (where it tense slightly). I don't even realize this is happening, usually because I'm focusing and/or being passive.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My eye muscles tend to twitch and tense
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With the aggressive attempt I made today, I found that my soloplexus was experiencing a sort of tightness... pressure... heaviness. In another attempt before that one, the sensation was even more profound and it felt overpowering to the extent where I had to stop what I was doing. The difference was that with the former attempt, I did not try to project aggressively.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another sensation I experienced during my aggressive period was that I would feel a slight lifting sensation—be it in the arms, or under my waist. I had checked just to make sure it wasn't my physical body reacting and I found that I was quite relaxed during that ordeal. The feeling is rather sudden and feels like a woosh, like someone's put their hand under a part of you and has lifted up with it—it feels like a loosening; I would say that it was probably my astral body loosening with my physical (am I right)?

I have this same problem, but ive only been trying to ap for a couple days now....
<br>
<br>
It feels like my hands, no my arms are coming out of where they should be and I can move them anywhere I want, but the rest of my body is not relaxed enough to have the same FEELING... And that is what I think it is, a feeling... BUT, im NOT giving up on this.  Are there any solutions to get me more relaxed?  I try the muscle thing but maybe I don't get my body throughly enough......Will it matter that much if I lay down when trying to project?  Ive been sitting in a chair that doe'snt have good neck support so my neck is sore after an hour of meditation...
<br>
<br>
I have a question I would like to ask advanced projectors.. My hands feel REALLY RELAXED and sometimes even though I know the position they are in physically they FEEL like they are in a different position.  I.E. when they are palms down they feel palms up or even sometimes I can move them around my body, but when i do this or try to put pressure on them I feel no actual pressure... Is this just a side affect of the trance state or Is this what projection feels like, except for the WHOLE body...
<br>
<br>
<br>
sorry to get so far off topic but I always get concerned with other things...

How long have you been trying? I find that you have to be able to relax into the process  , then relax some more , get your focus outside your body (the purpose of the techniques), then relax some more, WHILE keeping your mind awake then relax a little bit more. Do not be afraid to fall asleep if you feel you are not getting it, because you could do the obe after you let go totally in sleep.,

What do you mean outside of my body?  Like try to think about what it would feel like to be sitting in the next room watching t.v.?

I don't completely understand this whole thing yet so forgive me if I sound stupid...

Im not quite sure what you mean by your point of focus shifting... do you mean where your center of awareness originates from ?
<br>
Are you tryin to put mental pressure on your solarplexus to create a falling sensation?
<br>
The key to the falling technique is to feel the sensation in the pit of your stomach (to reproduce the actual feeling you get while falling) Have you ever jumped off something and felt the sensation it creates in your stomach?
<br>
<br>
Possibly if you break your questions up into smaller posts I think you will get more help its pretty tough to go through all of your post.

Reading today, I came across this excerpt from Robert Peterson's online book "Out of Body Experiences: How to have them and what to expect"
<br>
<br>
This is a relaxation technique for the face:
<br>
Next, relax your face completely. Here's one way to relax your face: With your eyes closed, stare deeper and deeper into the blackness, while very slowly tightening your eyebrows and rolling your eyes up slightly until your eyebrow muscles become tired. Then completely relax your facial muscles for about 15 seconds. Repeat the process again until your eyebrow muscles are tired again, and relax again for another 15 seconds. Repeat this process about six or seven times. Completely relax your whole body again and then try to make your mind blank and relaxed too. The vibrations may even come at this point, making the rest of the process unnecessary! After you're completely relaxed, pay no more attention to your body.
<br>
<br>
If you want to read the whole book (online and free!):

Leviiathan, you need to shift your focal point of awareness upwards to the top of your head. As this happens, your physical body will seem to just disappear from underneath you. Also, try not to concentrate on visualising whatever "exit technique" it is you are using too much. This can be a bar to projection.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
How do you mean "in 3rd person?" As in your actually watching yourself from the outside?
<br>
Could it be that by that time you're already projected?

Okay, I should upate my situation and clarify some things:
<br>
<br>
1) Point of Focus: close your eyes--at this very moment--tell me what you see/feel like. It's tactile imaging with added focus/perspective... tactile imaging from a certain point of space (and having your consciousness center around that space). I can close my eyes and have my center of focus in my very head. When I lay down, my head is usually propped on a pillow hence I could envision--or tactile image--if I chose to--a sort of awareness relative to these things. Sometimes my awareness is dull (so I focus only on my head)... sometimes I do a sort of third person awareness so that I am aware of my entire body... if that happens, my awareness if either above, below, or at the level of my body.
<br>
<br>
2) Shifts: I came to discover a correct means of climbing the rope. As I breath out, I move one hand to a high position on the rope; then during that split second of silence of having no breath in my lungs I grab; then as I breath in, I pull down on the rope and climb. This worked really well for me once, but indeed, it does require a lot of mental effort... recently I find I lack the metal strength to do this because it's time consuming and exhausting (time consuming because I'm still developing an ability to induce the alpha brain wave state)
<br>
<br>
3) I was able to induce the falling sensation associated with the change from beta to alpha... strangely enough, I was able to do this when my body wasn't entirely relaxed... err... I guess I'm sort of confused... I mean, usually when one induces this feeling, their body is supposed to be heavy and completely relaxed and feeling immobile (I know that feeling)--but it wasn't like that this time (or maybe it was... can't remember)... I think it was like that the second recent time I was able to do this. The first time, I started climbing the rope and I found it didn't even help me any better... because my body was still reacting to my mental exertion (when it shouldn't have been).
<br>
<br>
4) Back to what I was describing in step #2 (about climbing the rope). When I did do it that one time (where I had some notable success... I mean, that I seemed to be getting some results--that I was applying the tech successfully), I experienced some buzzing, but that ended up going away. I found that as I was climbing the rope, I would experience these sort of lifts... like a hand was being placed under my body and that--well, it was a sort of loosening, lifting, feeling of separation... which was confusing to me because I didn't know whether or not it was authentic. In some cases it was, in some cases it wasn't. Sometimes when I do this, my entirely body seems to feel like it's on a slant... even though I'm laying completely flat... that sort of awkward feeling makes it very hard for me to concentrate/focus because it feels like I'm slanted when I'm not.

Ah yes, Bob Peterson--I read his works years ago... about 5 years ago when I started getting into this. Mind you, I stopped after 3 months after I got involved in a Christian Youth Circle... and got back into it 2 years later... then stopped, then recently picked up on it again. At present, I've only been back into this sort of activity for about 2 weeks now.
