<br>
<br>
It was 3:00 AM on a Monday morning. I had been listening to coast to coast or Whitely Strieber.  I Thought, I have to get up at 5:00 AM tomorrow, so I set my alarm. I thought to myself  I might as well put on an affirmation tape by William Buhlman. It's going to be a long day tomorrow anyway.
<br>
<br>
By accident a feeling of paralysis came over me within minutes! I thought good but I want to cover myself up because I just turned on my air conditioner. I thought I had covered my self up over my head because it felt like my covers were over my face (witch I didn't like because now I was afraid I would suffocate If I were successful at leaving my body)!
<br>
<br>
A big hand grabbed my wrist!  I could see it! All of a sudden I was out of my body. I could tell because I could see through my transparent arm!  I was also standing at an impossible angle. As I tried to straighten into a normal position and start to explore to verify the experience.   I was back in my body.  The covers were off of me.
<br>
<br>
This is the first time I have had vision.  I will now try to verify whether the phenomena is real or hallucinatory as I hopefully improve.

Good job man!
<br>
<br>
Keep thinking about your experience and that it was real.
<br>
Also keep in mind that if you did it once you can do it as many
<br>
times as you want.
<br>
Good luck

G'Day/Night there to you Wierdzly, and welcome to Robert's kewl site too. There we go again with that darn 'ol paralysis thingy! I do wonder why that might happen so often for those of us who attempt to project? Well, it might be due to one only being projected partially in and out of their physical body, and so the person becomes stuck. That use to happen to me quite often whenever I started out projecting, or trying to project. Try not to panick and work through this if it ever happens to you again. Continue to visualize projecting out and seeing yourself as being exited/projected out is the best advice I can provide you with here at the moment. ~
<br>
<br>
Now, as for the big hand grabbing you. It could've been an infinite amount of things. It could've been your astral double/body trying to grab you out, your spirit guide or another projector who could've been trying to aid you in your projecting/exiting out. Who really knows though? One must have probably several projections first to know have some idea on what really might be going on.
<br>
<br>
Astral projecting 'really' can take time to learn how to do, especially if one's new at doing this! So, just keep trying and trying and don't give up at it! I've had some people offer to help me project before while they were standing near my physical body while they were in the astral. Maybe ask your spirit guide to assist you in projecting out sometime and see if he/she'd be willing to help you out. Ask him/her of course in your mind. It sure is always worth a try, believe me! (*smile*)
<br>
<br>
Hope this might help you out a bit more! Good luck to you! And, again, welcome here too! ~

I think it's so important to let yourself "suspend disbelief".
<br>
<br>
when I think of how much time I've wasted over the years trying to be cynical and "realistic" about my OBEs...

I don't see anything wrong with doing experiments to find out if you are creating the experience or observing. First I want to gain control over the experience, instead of not knowing the difference between fantasy and real time oob's.  I will then have more confidence that what I am seeing is real and not just self created.

real . . . self created . . . once you deeply recognize that there is no difference, you will be getting somewhere.

<br>
Yes, Tisha, my thoughts exactly.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, once you start trying to "prove" things to yourself, all kinds of ego attatchments start coming into play. On the Astral, as you believe so it becomes. Which means, if you get all cynical thinking you are creating the experience, then such will become your reality. If you think what you are seeing is real and not just self-created, such will become your reality.
<br>
<br>
Either way, you created your reality. And nothing about it was "real" in the true sense.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
