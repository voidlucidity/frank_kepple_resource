From what I've read so far, the phasing model seems to posit an awareness within a continuum, existing in all phases simultaneously but "focused" on a particular one more than others, e.g typically F1.
<br>
<br>
In this model, what happens to awareness when we sleep? Why doesn't this shutdown of attunement in F1 not transition into a full awareness of F2, etc? Is there a decoupling with memory? When awareness is "lost" in this model, where does it go? And why don't we go with it?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Dreaming is a particular action in consciousness that typically takes place within the area of Focus 2, in terms of the Phasing Model. Focus 2 is an area of individual consensus reality "next door" to the physical you could say. Every action in consciousness has certain characteristics that pertain to the action in question. It is a characteristic of dreaming that we typically do not offer ourselves an objective knowing of this action.
<br>
<br>
Such actions in consciousness have fairly powerful belief constructs attached that are linked to all manner of desires, intents, expectations and outcomes. We can offer ourselves an objective knowing of the dreaming action if we choose to. Though it is rather tricky overcoming the underlying beliefs that are determining our current circumstances surrounding the action. Keeping a dream-diary is one way of changing your beliefs in this area in order to create a different outcome through adopting the expression of a changed expectation.
<br>
<br>
Primary beliefs, desires, intents, expectations and outcomes are all inextricably linked in the same action-equation in consciousness. This means if you change one then everything changes to some extent.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Your post helped explain a few things. If you don't mind, I am going to ask a few question in order for me to solidify my understanding of what you are saying.
<br>
<br>
I guess what you are calling "objective-knowing" some people call self-reflection, would you agree? In a dream we aren't self-reflective and we just go with the flow. When a dream becomes lucid, that self-reflection is there (to an extent) and we are able to make decisions instead of just "going with the flow."
<br>
<br>
Now, you said in a previous post about Monroe and F4oC that you didn't know if Monroe was trying to give himself an objective knowing of F4oC and that is when he almost died. I couldn't find the post, so hopefully you remember that thread. Does this mean that we aren't able have an objective knowing of F4oC, that any phasing to F4oC would be have a "go with the flow" quality to it that we typically experience in dreams?
<br>
<br>
If this is the case, does that mean we are only able to have an objective knowing of F1oC, F2oC, and F3oC. Maybe that explains what you meant when you said that F4oC is the first step into a purely subjective area.
<br>
<br>
And the last question unrelated to my previous questions would be - what is the deal with dreamless sleep and how does that fit into the Phasing Model?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I still do not know what Monroe was trying to do exactly, I've been ever so busy on other things. He got up to so much did Monroe. I've been flipping through Ultimate Journey over the past few days just reading snippets here and there inbetween my other work and he makes me chuckle. He was so far out at times it's unreal in places. I guess as I'm flipping through I'll eventually come across the relevant section.
<br>
<br>
Self-reflection would be a type of objective knowing. Offering yourself an objective knowing is the basic action. This is where you view a thing, could be a circumstance a person or whatever as separate or outside of yourself. A subjective knowing would be, for example, having a feeling, an inkling, a hunch, an instinct, etc. An objective knowing is to do with meeting some person or "thing" within either F1/F2 or F3.
<br>
<br>
You can present yourself with an objective knowing of the the fact that Focus 4 of consciousness exists, but you cannot step into Focus 4 without all sense of "body" disintegrating. So you cannot stand in the mist of Focus 4 and start walking about exploring like you can in the other 3 Primary Areas.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing Model provides a basic map of the Wider Reality and presents the idea that our wider system is apportioned into 4 Primary Areas for specific purposes. "Dreamless sleep" is an action in consciousness that typically takes place within the area of Focus 2, an area of individual consensus reality.
<br>

Sorry, but I cannot recall the thread either but here is the post from my notes so you can do a Search on a specific phrase and it should come up.

Monroe was right there, I am sure of it. I think it was his interpretation of events that was different. But I am going to try and retrace those outward steps. It is something that has always bothered me. A kind of last link in the jigsaw that was missing with Monroe. I wonder where the heck he was. He was way out, but not in Focus 4 terms. There was something else. You cannot objectify Focus 4. It is a TOTAL disintegration of "self". Or maybe he was about to step into that. I wonder.
<br>
<br>
Seriously, I reckon he was about to attempt to step into *another* dimension of consciousness from Focus 3. Entering into a complete "Trans-Dimensional" state. And that is what I have been trying to study for ages, these Trans-Dimensional areas. I reckon
<i>
 that
</i>
is why his physical was put at risk. Okay, I'm guessing now, I admit. But I am going to completely retrace his footsteps over the next few months.
<br>
<br>
If he were trying to enter another dimension, then that is just incredible. That is not Focus 3, 4 or 5, that is just completely into the total unknown. And I mean unknown. Unless he was attempting to enter focus 4 while holding a complete objective knowing of that fact. That would just be crazy. You'd just be short-circuiting every subjective energy circuit that ever was. I doubt anyone could have the objective will to do that. Just too many natural laws against you. It couldn't happen.
<br>
<br>
I just wonder what on earth he found, what secrets there are still to be unlocked from Monroe. So I'm going to begin again from page one and work through it until that final piece of the jigsaw falls into place.

Are you aware of any research that the Monroe Institute has done in this area? I'm not too familiar with what they do other than train people to AP, but you would think that it would be an important part of their research.

I'm guessing if it were possible, Frank, you would have contacted Monroe in focus 3 or is there any possible way to find someone... then again.... who knows where Monroe is at this point lol

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm not all that aware of the details of TMI courses or research other than what Monroe writes about in his later books. Monroe created a system of focus states as a teaching aid but he never had to use them personally as his skill was beyond using them. The focus states are used as a beginner's introduction that breaks everything down into stages. Once a person becomes proficient they get to the stage where they can simply phase to wherever they want to be.
<br>
<br>
In answer to the other question about contacting Monroe, I have on a number of occasions tried and have come across someone who could be Monroe, but I have not (yet) managed to confirm that to myself.
<br>
<br>
Note: Unless I can actually confirm things to myself I don't like commenting as it all gets a too speculative for my tastes.
<br>
<br>
Within focus 27 there is also meant to be a kind of "TMI-There" which is a concept written about by Bruce Moen in one of his books that I read. Again, this is something I have yet to find any real evidence of. I'm not saying there isn't. Just that I haven't managed to find any satisfactory evidence (satisfactory to me I mean) that would confirm it for me. I have received distinct impressions but not enough to be able to comment with any degree of sureness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Frank:
<br>
I just sent you a PM titled "Finding Monroe" that has a question to ask him. It is some information that isn't widely known that I learned while I was at TMI. If you want to go about verifying whether or not you are speaking to Monroe, ask him that question and PM me back his answer and we will see if it is right.
