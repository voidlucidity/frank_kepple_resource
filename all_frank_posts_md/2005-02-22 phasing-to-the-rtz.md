Just a question.  I've already looked for the answer and haven't found anything too precise.  What I want to know is, is it possible to get to a focus level and then from there, phase into the RTZ?
<br>
<br>
I remember a recent post by Gandalf, but that didn't really say how you could do it.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know and could you tell me?  I'm interesting in other methods of acheiving AP cause so far, some other methods I'm using aren't working too good.

I like that phraseology, a good "mind lock" on Focus 12. Because once you get that, then there is no stopping it. Well, not in conventional Monroe terms anyway.
<br>
<br>
What I mean is, both myself and Sarah (Selski) have managed to engage Focus-12 while remaining very physically oriented. But that is maybe not something people should be aiming for at first. I think the traditional idea of the physical-body being out of the equation, so to speak, is a good one to begin with. Otherwise we'll have to entertain Focus 10, Mind Awake Body Awake, and it just doesn't flow somehow, lol.

Agreed.

<br>
I wondered though, getting back to Andali's original point, if we can give her any "precise" pointers? I'm struggling to come up with any. She seems to want to get to a focus level and then Phase into the RTZ. Personally, I have always struggled with the translation of Monroe Focus Levels versus the RTZ.

Okay, I think I'll clarify here.
<br>
<br>
I seem to be able to achieve a MABA stage quite early on in focus 10.  I can comfortably lie down, relax and 'lose my body' so to speak, in under half an hour.  From there, I'll focus on breathing and imagining myself as a point of consciousness somewhere at the back of my neck, looking up to the 'expanse of my mind', something Frank said once before I think.  I then do the 180 phase shift thing and alternate in between that and the POC (point of consciousness).
<br>
<br>
Since the first time it happened, I havn't gotten back to F12 but I think that may be because I have expectations now and nothings happens because of that.  I usually get bored and roll over and go to sleep.
<br>
<br>
What I heard was possible was that you could actually phase into the RTZ.  I don't know how but it seems that it worked once before, even when I wasn't trying which, works better for me anyway, cause my brain doesn't have enough to formulate an escape plan or whatever else it tries to do to change my mind.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I haven't managed to get to F12 again since that Saturday.  I do recall now, some auditory noise, in fact, the Friday night, I heard a sound alternate from my left ear to my right, like a plane flew through the center of my head.
<br>
<br>
At the moment, there's an issue of a weird feeling on my left ankle which occurs around a deeper F10, like something's spinning around it, not sure how to describe it but I can move it up and down using a NEW technique.  It wanes my concerntration and then I focus on that instead trying to stop it.  I'm sure it will fade but aside from that.
<br>
<br>
The advice you guys have given is good, thanks for taking the time to answer.
<br>
<br>
I will try to project again but I'll try and do a repeat of Saturday, simulate the circumstances again.  I usually try at night, not morning because of school and stuff.  I need my wits about me for VCE,
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
, and can't be drifting off during Math or some other class.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, got anything else helpful?

Hi guys, sorry don't have long at the moment, but just to try to clarify what i mean by phasing to rtz:
<br>
<br>
When we arrive in the usual focus state whereupon we begin seeing images from other levels of consciousness, these are for the most part snapshots of different astral enviroments which you can then choose to step into them ie 'phasing'.
<br>
<br>
However, quite a few times, the snapshots i get appear to be quite obviously from the rtz itself, eg my bedroom, somewhere else in the house, outside ony local highstreet and so on. if i step into these i am then flying around in a typical 'obe state' around my house, outside etc in a bog standard obe type experience, only I have completley missed out on all the usual 'energy raising', 'seperation' and all the other stuff that goes along with standard obe techniques.
<br>
Now you might say: 'but the whole point of phasing is to focus AWAY from the physical, and you'd be right. How I think this works is this: You have to 'go there to come back'. That is, you have to focus away from the physical until you are on a different level of awareness required for normal phasing practice.. however you then place the intent to goto the rtz but what happens is rather than just 'wake up' again you go back to the rtz BUT FOCUSED AWAY FROM YOUR BODY ie 'out of body'. in order to do this, your awareness automatically generates a temporary energy interface to allow you to focus on the physical enviroment away from your body..Perhaps this energy comes from your physical body, lending some truth to the old 'etheric energy' idea. this is what they call your 'astral body' but it is used for the rtz only and only exists for as long as you are there, afterwhich it disapates. I would also say that this sounds fairly complicated but this all seems to happen automatically so you dont really have to worry about it.
<br>
<br>
In the rtz i usually have a body but not always, sometimes i feel that i am just a ball of energy.
<br>
<br>
So this has led me to believe that the rtz can be accessed through phasing techniques just as other levels can be, and that this is much easier than standard obe practice.
<br>
This has led me to wonder what difference there really is between the rtz and other astral enviroments. there must be some because in the rtz i cannot interact with anything, whereas in other levels of consciousness i can.
<br>
This has implications for 'astral bodies' for example, as i mentioned earlier. how do we perceive the rtz without our physical bodies as receivers? our awareness or focus must generate a temporary energy interface in order to perceive the physical, away from our bodies.. this 'astral interface' is what is normally described as your astral body, but it is just a temporary construct. So RBs techniques are fine.. standard energy raising techniques are the usual means for creating this shell or astral body;
<br>
all i'm saying is: for those of you who are interested in rtz explorations, but are rubbish at standard obe techniques (like me) but ARE ok at phasing.. well you can use phasing instead. and it would appear that through phasing your 'body' is generated automatically with no effort on your part at all!
<br>
<br>
Doug
<br>
<br>
PS
<br>
But before I get too pleased with this discovery: what if im not in the rtz at all? Maybe i just think I am, but in reality i am in an astral construct of my own design which just happens to look exactly like my rtz enviroment...
<br>
in which case my whole theory blows away in the wind haha.. and i am not in the rtz at all... go back to standard obe techniques if you want to explore the rtz!
<br>
This is a possiblity, which i thought i would mention before anyone else does, but i would say that my explorations of the rtz recently have gone a long wy to convincing me that i am indeed in the rtz

<section>
Some of you may remember, I have a simply topological model (a hypercube?) for explaining the RTZ/Phasing connection. So not really news but I feel I should summarize it here.
<br>
<br>
I think too that RTZ and astral projections have a similar dynamics. The best explanation I came up with so far is the cone metaphor. Basically the cone is like an organ or interface, an extension of our Higher Self through which their localize themselves to here and now by operating a local device called the physical body. The cone represents the sum total of states that our energy body are able to occupy when we travel from the RTZ back to the astral.
<br>
<br>
So the cone itself is more attached to the Higher Self than the physical body and projections is similar to a gradual retraction.
<br>
<br>
The tip of the cone is the RTZ field serves as an interface to control the physical body. In the other direction, the nonlocalised expanse of the cone corresponds with various "astral states of consciousness." One of these states is that we are supposed to be in these holy moments, our mind which operations are at least coinciding with various distinct brain states.
<br>
<br>
Yet, projection basically is like a gradual retraction - the more delocalised/expanded parts we are identify ourselves within the cone the more astral like our experience will become. Every projections occur through or inside this cone which is, from an another point of view, can be described as the trace of our energy body when it leaves the RTZ by the expansion / decondensation or delocalisation process. This process is not only means gradual liberation from space but also from time as well.
<br>
<br>
In RTZ projections the top of the cone somehow become misaligned, most likely due to decreased sensory experiences and progressive brain synchronization (non-REM sleep) resulting in the weakening of body identification. Basically, at these stage a duplication of the cone's termination have to occurs, albeit gradual dissociation of the consciousness field from its physical mechanisms is far from being such a distinct or easily explainable process. The metaphor of a retractable cone is definitely weak here and I suspect there are at least two things mixed up here.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure majority of those projections most people call "RTZ" are really just false awakening type lucid dreams (at least so are those of mine) because getting awareness in a paralyzed state and rolling out from the body simply not guarantee such an experiences. Most "RTZ projections" I believe are acted out in one secret chamber of the mind that governed by our expectations about the postseparational environment.
<br>
<br>
When the thalamus close the gate of the sensory channel through harsh pulsations and noises separation of a phantom body become possible. It's really a phantom body generated by the internal wiring of the brain, still in use at these moment of wakefulness, but in the absence of proprioceptive sensory feedback it become missaligned. Again, being in this body is simply not grantees an RTZ experience.
<br>
<br>
Any RTZ experience requires a second body, a dense-enough energy field to interact its environment. Such an experience require a great amount of energy, focus and discipline. On the other hand, identifying ourselves with the tip of the consciousness cone (the RTZ body) just after separation is a trend since having awareness on the body at the moments of paralysation indeed supports this focus. This is I think why concentrating on the body as a bunch of gentle, internal vibrations and inner noises (centered in the chest which is the somatic projections of the thalamus) is so important in the pracice of traditional OBEs.
<br>
<br>
A more visually oriented attention will more likely result in phasing. Hypnagogic screens are like terminations of tubes that connects the energy body / subconsciousness with various dream bubbles dispersed in the "astral proper." First they are screens then start to act like windows. It is possible to turn and toss or even spin with a phantom body and at the same time looking through a window like screen that seems to hover above the inhomogeneous expanse of the mind. For me, a typical projection build from elements of both type of method, because I used to switch between and progress simultaneously on both direction of my awareness.
<br>
<br>
Do you think that reality fluctuations simply cease to bother you when you are in the astral? It seems more likely that the entire experience becomes a great illusion in which freedom of interpretation simply goes too far from still being a proper transcription of non-physical events. These experiences, at least at the raw level, are really incomprehensible for the human mind. Yet paradoxically they are more usable than those we having in RTZ projection. Symmetric translation of the universal language of consciousness? Or simply self-deception?
<br>
<br>
The RTZ proper is not distinctly ends at some mysterious point but gradually transforms into the geography of the astral while the energy body expand further. The delocalisation process has to follow not only the local atmospheric conditions and geomagnetic structure of the Earth, dream places that are tend to unite various physical places will correspond in states that correspond with the middle region of the cone thus have to be mirrored in the decondensation process itself. At the end, the energy body appear like giant cloud with various seeds and spurs - at least this is what my experiences with zooming and rubber-banding support in these just-above-the-RTZ states.
<br>
<br>
Flying up in the RTZ causes rapid decondensation of the energy body and at this point the metaphor of the cone become more apparent. Flying upwards means decomposition of the RTZ body as its bulk is supposed to build from atmospheric ions which has a greater density close to the surface. Without this component we might able to perceive the waking reality through the veil of dreams but one of the proposed RTZ-anchor is lost. The core proportion of the energy body is supposed to be the subject of the fluctocondenstion as an entirely vacuum realized entity. To gather atmospheric particles it should be condensed enough at the first place. And there should be at least another part, apparently the most dense yet temporal part of the RTZ body, a honey like substance that rapidly flow back into the body through a cable like organ.
<br>
<br>
RTZ projections seem to coincide with the TMI Focus F12,  state of artificial hypnagogia. The apex of the cone, dissociation, internal projection if you like. F21 is the phasing expanse. TMI experiences, the induction script they use and the frequency analysis of the audio signals highly support this hypothesis.

Exactly. When you get an energy body homogeneously expanded into the entire physical universe you are God in focus infinity. Human astral territories are "closer," we just need to expand into the Earth's magnetosphere.

Other dimensions are not above or below us they are everywhere. The cone symbol is only the first step to understand this fact, still holding the concept of 'above.' since getting out by going inside is really like exploding.

You should exaggerating here JAW. I can't believe you doesn't understand even a word. If is it so, no hope for you, hehe. I know it's difficult at first. The last thing I want here to write only one people - Major Tom obviously got it against every weakness of my post.
<br>
<br>
After all it's a matter of intuition yet I'm sure it is explainable. Yes, I'm a little lazy, hate examples (going for them would quickly inflate the text) and my English is horrible to say at least but nevertheless, I thought I was successful. But apparently not, and believe me, I'm able to imagine how annoying could be seeing a weirdo like I am explaining the perfect nonsense.
<br>
<br>
But trust me, after you got the basic picture the rest become so obvious that it will explain itself. Your intuition will further guide you to enhance your own way of OBE practice. At least this is what I'm hoping for. Hey, Major Tom, are you here? Can you say something to JAW or happened to have some idea about how to make this excrement more user friendly?

<section>
Lol JAW, don't be sarcastic. Let us exercise our vein on more abstract themes.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Tom. I got it now and agree with you. You are talking about the episodic structure of projections: going out again and again in the same session; an inherent feature of every close-to-RTZ projection that initiated from a near ASP state.
<br>
<br>
Horizontal splitting certainly have to occur if we look on the process from a 3D perspective but now let's proceed further and see the cone as it is, a multidimensional entity, a hyper or super cone lol or something like that. From this perspective our entire world is represented as a point in which the cone's tip resides.
<br>
<br>
From this perspective (as JAW was about to point out), a typical multi-episodic projection seems to use various cones with the very same root and as many expanses (decondensing into various astral domains) as many episodes have / will be occured in the projection. Except the case when we go back to the same place/time.
<br>
<br>
Upper parts of the cone are progressively deliberated from time, going hand in hand with the delocalization process, thus, experiences in the expanses have to be highly independent from linear time.
<br>
<br>
The confusion appears when we try to identify the "bioenergetic link" (a definition from Frank I suppose) that connects Higher Self with the physical body with the emanation cone we are talking about here. The first will last to death but the latter is episodic and marks only the trace of deconsensation. Experiences in the expanses are somehow prewritten and to remember them in our linear time we should download them by the cone.
