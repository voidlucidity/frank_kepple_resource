Hi:
<br>
<br>
Depends what you mean by astral plane. But for the most part it's your choice. You can communicate mind to mind or verbalise as per normal. This holds true until you reach Focus 4 (in Phasing Model terms) then you are within an entirely subjective area of reality so it's mind to mind only.
<br>
<br>
Well, saying that it goes even beyond mind to mind. Everything just is, it all becomes you, as a concept. So you don't "communicate" as such, you engage communication as a concept and so communication becomes you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

If you are interested in seeing what it is like then watch the movie "Solaris".  There are several scenes in which George Clooney talks with his diseased wife with a type Astral communication.  It's really fascinating and is just how I communicate there.
