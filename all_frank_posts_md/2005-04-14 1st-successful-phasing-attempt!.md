<section>
Thursday. April 14, 2005
<br>
<br>
Last night I had my 1st true phasing experience. I fully focused my attention in F2oC. It was actually fairly incredible. I was lying in my bed attempting to "phase" like I had been doing the last week or so, except this time, I adopted the attitude of "meh". I really didn't care if it happened or not. I decided I would create an imaginary place in my mind.
<br>
<br>
Apon doing so, I had an intention to go there. So I started constructing this place. I decided I was particularly fond of old growth forests, so I constructed a log cabin midst a clearing. I then followed up be piecing bits of scenery around and filling in the details and whatnot. I remember to try and engage my senses inside my mind, so I did. After a good while, 15 mins or so, this place of mine became sooo real, that I was actually inside it, in 1st person, with all my senses going strong. I would walk, and hear my footsteps, I'd look at a tree, and see every leaf without trying to them, I could hear wind blowing in the trees. It was actually pretty intense. I completely forgot about my physical body, I was totally immersed in my creation. It was so weird, it was like being in a dream, except 100% aware. Now, I know this was F20c because it was really susceptible to thoughts, often times I had to "flex my muscles" so to speak, to get rid of "negs".
<br>
<br>
I guess I will give a detailed description of my experience:
<br>
<br>
I began constructing the log cabin midst a clearing of about 100x100 feet inside a virgin forest. I pictured the cabin being rectangular in shape, and having a straw roof. I made a door in the front on one of the shorter sides. I decided it would be awesome to have a garden on the left side of the cabin (relative to the front door). Then, I decided in the back of the house, one of the old growth trees needed a tree house up in it, and so it was born 200 feet up with no ladder. To the rear right next to the treeline grew blackberry bushes.
<br>
<br>
Then, I realized I would need entrances to the clearing, and so a long path was made in the very front center, that veered to the left about 150 feet down it. Another path was made right center, that went straight as far as I could see. I then realized I had not entered my cabin! So I walked in, and begin laying down my thoughts as to the interior design. After walking in, to the left you will find a kitchen table and 4 chairs. To the right, a TV area with love-seat, and surround sound :p. Behind the dining room table, you will find a counter that comes out from the wall, about 5 feet. Behind that is the kitchen area. Behind all that, would be a bedroom. And so my cabin was created.
<br>
<br>
I left it and realized I did not have an orchard! So, I pushed back the treeline on the side with the garden good 200 feet, and BAM, freshie orchard. I then, decided to to furnish my tree-house. I flew up there (yeah, I learned how to fly =D) and made a little bed in the far right corner, and a little desk in the rear left corner. I paused for a moment deciding what to put beside the bed. I thought of a cool little end table, and it appeared there. For a little while I was content, but i grew weary and bored, so I removed the end table, and made a window beside the door and mounted a Gatling gun turret over looking my forest paradise.
<br>
<br>
All right, I flew around my cabin a few times admiring my creating feeling proud, and generally noticing how real everything felt. At that moment, I decided it was time to explore. Then, some for some reason I created an entity, a female companion. I know now that she was an aspect of myself that I used to bring up subjects that I needed to press into my subconscious. So we began meandering down the front center pathway.
<br>
<br>
As I we were walking, I remember noticing how amazingly real it all was, I could hear to sets of foot prints, I could see every pebble, every leaf, every blade of grass and I could smell the forest air. So we rounded the bend that I mentioned earlier, and there was a pile of rubble blocking the road. My companion then posed the question: "Oh now, how are we gonna get past?" (NOTE: This is what I meant by "pressing ideas into my subconscious" I knew that I had the power to do whatever, but she was the aspect of myself that I used to bring these powers into awareness).  I then replied "I'm all powerful, and I can do anything, and you can as well". I then used telekinesis to fling the pile of rubble into space. We walked about 30 more feet down the path. Then, a thought came into my head that there could be negative entities. As soon as I thought that, a MASSIVE spider appeared right behind us. (I think my subconscious chose the spider because I had seen the scene in LOTR with the spider before bed).
<br>
<br>
At 1st, I was somewhat frightened because I could see this spider in amazing detail, its hairs, the reflection of the surroundings in its eyes and I could hear its hisssssing. But as soon as I remembered this is my would, I used telekinesis to shoot into into the forest. Now, that was especially cooool, because my subconscious created the effects of it mowing down trees as the effect of my launching it directly into the forest. I could see all the trees crash, I could see its legs flailing, and I could clearly hear the trees snapping.
<br>
<br>
At that moment I looked again at the place where the spider was. I guess I was a still a bit shocked at the sight of this thing and still had a bit of negative thoughts in my mind, so all these baby spiders, about 6 were running at me (they were still huge haha, about a foot across). But just like before, I remembered I was a god in this world, as mangled them up good, with several fireballs. Haha, that was so cool, because it sooo real feeling. I then reassured my companion that we are all powerful (to press it into my subconscious). So off we were down the path when I decided a straight path was no longer needed.
<br>
<br>
I created a fork that went off to the right. I then created a signpost that said there was a mountain straight and a cave down the right path.  My partner then piped up that the cave was probably spider-less :p. That was particularly amusing because I did not think of saying that!!!. So told her, we would continue forwards toward the mountain. I then paused for a bit, to take in my surroundings and admire the realness. TO my front, was a mountain in the distance, down the path towards the cave were these hills, and i looked back at where my cabin was supposed to be. It occurred to me that all the trees where I was were tiny in comparison to the ones surrounding the cabin, so naturally when I looked back, I saw towering trees right where they were supposed to be. I looked at the ground, saw individual pebbles, singular blades of grass. It was just to real. So onwards we trekked.
<br>
<br>
We came to another pile of rubble about 100 feet down the path!. My sidekick, said, "not another pile, will you get rid of it?". I then reminded her of her powers, so she just flew over it. But that wasn't cool enough for me :p.
<br>
<br>
I use telekinesis to lift it up out of the ground, and made it fly into the forest, (which had similar effects as the spider hitting the trees). I looked down and it seemed the pit that remained was bottomless. I then had a negative thought of someone falling down it, which of course led to my partner falling immediately.  So, of course I, once again, flexed my brainpower, she flew up flawlessly. Again I had to remind her of our god like abilities. So we continued on down the path another 30 or so feet until I got the urge to create new forks.
<br>
<br>
I made a path to the right that led to a "evil forest" (I think at the time I decided I might want to do some battling in the future :p). And another path that went left wise, to a village. I got a glimpse of what the village might look like, think tee-pees. I decided not to go there because I did not think I was ready, but perhaps I didn't have enough energy to create such a village with people all over. So me and my new friend decided to continue our adventure towards the mountain. But first I decided to have a look around. It was awesome that nothing lost its vividness. Towards the town there was even smoke rising, that I didn't create, but it just seemed likely. And over to the "evil forest" were huge trees surrounded in mist. I looked up at the mountain and it was even a little bigger now that we were closer. At this point I don't know why, but my friend (who had no name by the way) asked what I would do if something attacked us. UHH, I guess she was a little slow :p. I told her, for like the 5th time, nothing could happen. She said " what if a... a....a big bear attacked us!".  I decided to show her exactly what would happen
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
.
<br>
<br>
So I said " You mean like that one!" as I pointed to the big brown bear running straight at us from the mountain path. So, feeling playful, I took it on hand to hand, or..hand to paw haha. Of course, I messed it up good. But, I saw it lying on the ground bleeding, and I somehow felt compassion for it!!, So I revived it, and made it run away into the trees. Then, I remember how cool my cabin was :p. So I grabbed my companion by the hand and started to fly back, low to the ground. It was really amazing because everything we passed was still there, looking real as ever. There were even smoldering bits of baby spider hahaha.
<br>
<br>
We arrived at the cabin, and sat down inside at the dining room table. She asked if I wanted to play chess. I said "umm, sure I guess". we took about 4 moves each, and I decided I was bored, so I walked outside. At that point I looked around at the scenery, marveled in its beauty, and felt content with my experience. I opened my physical eyes and just laid there smiling.

And yes, paragraphs would be nice, thats hard to swallow in one bite

<br>
<br>
Anyway, did notice yourself going deeper into relaxation when you did this? Like did you go through F10 or F12? I guess what im asking is what "sensations" did you go through before you arrived in the astral? Just asking because I started practicing phasing recently myself and a second view would be helpful.

Ok, sensation wise, I started by laying down and doing some deep breathing exercises, and relaxed into by bed.
<br>
<br>
Pretty much all my previous attempts last week were all about getting a solid focus 10. So I arrived in that state in about 10 Min's. I had little feeling, and forgot where my arms were he he.
<br>
<br>
I had made a point to myself the previous night, to not try and picture myself in my scenery, because it usually ends up in 3rd person. So I figured I would just cut that out, and the 1st person POV would naturally come. Boy how right I was.
<br>
<br>
After that, I remember when I started to build my cabin, It could only focus on one aspect of it (ie: the visual, or the audio, or smells).  But I pushed the idea of "TRYING" to engage my senses aside, and went on with the building.
<br>
<br>
After I while, I noticed I could engage multiple senses, which was fairly cool seeing as I wasn't trying.
<br>
<br>
Soon, I was totally immersed.
<br>
<br>
There was so, physical sensations, no exit symptoms, no noises, no vibrations. The transition was mega-smooth and only took about 5 Min's.

Thanks for the Re:, clears alot up for me

Ive also been working on just getting to focus 10 the past few days and seem to be able to do it in about 30-45 mins pretty constantly. I think the idea of building your own pad is pretty cool, because it really does keep you from thinking too much about the physical. Il try it tonight

So you were actually in the scenery, by phasing? You could touch, and feel, and smell and hear and all?

For anyone practicing phasing, remember a huge part of your success is engaging your physical senses. I tried this for the first time last night, I was walking around my apartment I created, trying to hear, smell, touch as much as possible and it gave me much better results. I think i actually made it to the edge of "the void" before zapping back to C1.

Astralwych:
<br>
<br>
At first, you tend to see it in your mind and then comes what I call "the switch". This is where you switch from looking from a distance to actually being there in first-person. At this point, you are no longer focused within the physical: you are within Focus 2 of consciousness. This is the region that mystics typically call the astral and is, therefore, the area of consciousness where people do their "obe-ing" together with their dreaming, lucid dreaming, and whatever else besides.
<br>
<br>
Do it right and there are no "exit" symptoms at all, no vibrations or feelings of separation. It's just one smooth transition, or phase-shift from Focus 1 to Focus 2. Think of it as a highly controlled lucid dream where you know exactly where you are and what you are doing, and every element of the experience is under your control.
<br>
<br>
Once you are at Focus 2 you have two basic choices: 1) you can have fun doing whatever it is you want to do, or, 2) you can phase-shift to another area of consciousness. Phase shifting to other focuses of attention or areas of consciousness is a LOT easier from Focus 2 than it is from Focus 1, i.e. the physical. However, the BIG problem with Focus 2 in the past has been the fact that people have not fully realised that they are within the realms of their own imagination.
<br>
<br>
If you arrive within Focus 2 with certain expectations then those expectations will be fulfilled, or will come about. Obviously, you might say, as it is your own imagination. Well, it's starting to become obvious now to more and more people. But in the past, people have thought of this area as some weird and whacky separate kind of place that they "travel to". Once you realise that you are actually within your own imagination, the area becomes a lot tamer, so to speak. In other words, it becomes a *lot* easier to handle being in the environment.
<br>
<br>
Once a person learns how to handle the environment, this offers them a big benefit. Like I say, it is a LOT easier to phase-shift from F2 to F3 or F4 than it is to phase-shift from F1 to F3 or F1 to F4. This is because the physical captures our focus of attention quite a bit and we don't really access these areas much. We occupy them, but we don't objectively access them normally. Some people do, but the vast majority of people don't. Once we are away from that physical capture-effect, we offer ourselves a great deal more fluidity in our movement in consciousness.
<br>
<br>
The easiest phase shift that can be enacted from the physical is F1 to F2. This is because we engage F2 on an ongoing basis already. All the core belief constructs that we hold, our day-to-day thinking, our imagination, our memory, and so forth, these are all held within Focus 2 of consciousness and we access this area every minute of the day. Plus, it's usually where we go to dream. So that's why it is easier to phase-shift to F2 as it's something we habitually do anyway.
<br>
<br>
So that's the core strategy. You take the relatively easy phase-shift to F2oC, then, instead of getting totally wrapped up in your own spurious imaginings and totally losing it, as people typically have done in the past, you retain a high degree of control and use F2oC as a launch-pad into the other 2 areas, i.e. F3 and F4 of consciousness. Or, you can "backtrack" a little and enter the RTZ from the "other direction" as it were.
<br>
<br>
Well, that's if you want to do any of this. You can stay where you are and just play around shifting your perception if you like. Have an "astral projection" experience, or engage in a little "pathworking" in the traditional sense, or you can just have fun flying around. It's entirely up to you.
<br>
<br>
You see, that's the beauty of the Phasing Model. It presents you with a valid structure in which you can engage your experiences, and you always know where you are in the general scheme of things. Think of it like having an accurate map. You can drive around in a strange town if you want. Just go here and there at random to see what comes up, as that's often the most exciting way of exploring. But at any time you can consult the map and find out where you are.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Ben:
<br>
<br>
Yes, I always recommend that when you create the mental rundown, you will make "the switch" from 3rd person to 1st person much quicker and/or more reliably, if you simultaneously engage a number of physical senses in the rundown. Smell, I have found is a powerful one with me. I love to imagine smelling freshly baked bread. I imagine an old country kitchen with an aga-style stove and there's a freshly baked loaf on the top cooling off. Even just typing this I can smell it within me and I want to go to it, lol.
<br>
<br>
So you will also make better progress if you imagine something you enjoy doing. Well, apart from the obvious, of course... ha ha ha... sex, I have found, has a very powerful pull but it has the detrimental effect of also engaging the physical. The two can easily end up in conflict, i.e. the physical is pulling you one way, and your non-physical rundown is pulling you the other, so to speak, and you end up locked in the middle of them.
<br>
<br>
Music is another powerful one I find, particularly flute. I imagine I can hear a distant flute and it's getting closer and closer. Before I know it, I've turned a corner in my mind and I come across the someone who is playing. This kind of technique is great for transitioning directly to Focus 3, where you engage a rundown with a "party unknown". It's kinda freaky coming across them. The first time I tried the flute idea, I suddenly found myself in the company of a person playing. As I approached, they stopped playing to introduce themselves and we started chatting. Then I suddenly realised, hang on a minute, I'm not imagining this! At which point I realised I had transitioned to Focus 3, not Focus 2 as I had originally planned.
<br>
<br>
It's a very powerful technique, engaging a party-unknown, and you can quite easily phase-shift directly to F3 from using it. But I don't recommend it for beginners. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to create an Aspect of yourself within F2oC and you engage yourself in a kind of facsimile experience. In other words, you engage in a scenario you create within F2 rather than engaging in an interaction with someone "separate" to yourself within F3. Once you have a little experience of F3 then it's easy to tell the difference, but quite tricky if you haven't.
<br>
<br>
Many traditionalists who try to engage in the objective action of viewing one's "higher self" for example, create all manner of Aspects of themselves within F2oC as a result. They think they've gone off on some deep-meaning "journey" and found "god" and all that kind of thing, and they are just engaging in wish-fulfilment actions within F2oC. So, generally, you need to be careful you aren't fooled when meeting "people". We all have many, many other Aspects of ourselves within F2oC. We each hold an enormous number of belief constructs, we create all manner of "shrines" to our likes and dislikes, etc., etc. So it's very easy to be sucked in and, before you know it, you'll be chewing crystals for breakfast and going to work in a manure-powered car... ha ha ha...
<br>
<br>
I'm just kidding on the latter. But many people you can tell from some of the stuff they write, that what they are doing is engaging aspects of their own self within F2oC without realising it.
<br>
<br>
Not that there is anything wrong in engaging aspects of your own self, it's great fun, and there's nothing wrong with a nice bit of wish fulfilment. The key is whether you actually realise and know whether that's what you are doing or not. You can engage in some mock battle between all manner of demons and devils, for example, if that is your thing. Severe problems can arise, however, when people come to believe (as millions have done in the past) that those demons and devils have a kind of reality of their own.
<br>
<br>
So at first it is probably best to keep your rundown very simple and perhaps not try to reach too far too quickly, so to speak. Focus 2 of consciousness can be used as a handy launch pad to the other areas quite easily, so there is no disadvantage in phase-shifting from F1 to F2 first, then aiming for F3.

<br>
I know exactly what you mean by "the switch", I got so close today! The only thing I would add is, it's extremely tempting to try to do something to chase after "the switch" when you see it coming.
<br>
<br>
Up until that point, I was seeing things in my mind (from a distance, I guess, as Frank describes it, but it is pretty difficult to describe accurately) and then I began to feel like I was somewhere else, I could see from first-person like my eyes were open and everything were normal, only I was somewhere else. But it wasn't quite formed, and I had the tendency to want to chase it, to do something to get there, because it was so close - which only caused me to tense up and lose focus.
<br>
<br>
So if you recognize "the switch" when you are practicing, remember to just

 relax

Mactombs:
<br>
<br>
That's how it is, like you are the same person but the only thing that changed is your environment. You are just your normal self, but you've come about somewhere else. This is the phase-shift from F1 to F2 of consciousness. It's an initial "switch" from seeing a person in your mind engaged in some action or other to do with your rundown, and then to actually becoming that person you were previously seeing.
<br>
<br>
Ha ha ha, it's so very tempting to want to force it! That's why I'm of the opinion that it's better to think of the experience coming to you, rather than you going to it. Because if you are thinking of going to it, as it were, when it doesn't quite gel there is a tendency to try to want to chase it. And the more you try and do that the more elusive it becomes. So when you find yourself losing it, simply take a step back from it and allow it to come back to you. It's only tension, I suppose, that tends to throw a spoke in the works.
<br>
<br>
A part of you is observing all the while and once you think you're close this little voice pipes up saying something like, "Yes, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!" Of course, next moment you lose focus and end up back where you started. :)

Well, apart from the obvious, of course... ha ha ha... sex, I have found, has a very powerful pull but it has the detrimental effect of also engaging the physical. The two can easily end up in conflict, i.e. the physical is pulling you one way, and your non-physical rundown is pulling you the other, so to speak, and you end up locked in the middle of them.

Haha, I too have tried using sex as one of my ways to engage myself. But, and this is a little strange to admit on a public forum, as soon as i actually started to engage myself with my senses, i STARTED TO ENGAGE MYSELF if you know what I mean!
<br>
<br>
Lol, so i guess that is out of the question. I will try some other senses next time I practice. Maybe sound would be best, Im a very musical person.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks for the great re:!

What a terrific experience, Prophet! I have not yet tried to influence what I saw or did in the astral, obe... I would imagine all kinds of healing could take place there.

Question.
<br>
I don't know what the phases mean but by the sounds of it he was in a Lucid dream and not experiencing astral projection. I thought that astral projection was the mind travalling outside of the body and not within itself. What he described to sounded to me like he was under having a Lucid dream. Am I wrong?
<br>
Also is does Focus 2 mean a form of Lucid Dreams and is Focus 3 travelling in the astral?
<br>
Could someone post a link to a page defining the phasing and the Focus theory?

Liam,
<br>
<br>
Any particular questions you have can probably be found in the FAQ area of the forum. For example:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=17413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 What is "Phasing"?
</a>
<br>
<br>
To give a quick answer though: The difference between a 'lucid' dream and F2oC, is simply how concentrated you are on F2oC. When someone dreams, they are about 60 - 70% concentrated on F2oC. What it can be summarised in to is that F2oC is your creating area. You can build, destroy, alter, do whatever you want to whatever you want. It's like a big play place. It is the central area of your imagination. Thought directly equals action.
<br>
<br>
F3oC can be more thought of as our place in the universe. Somewhere beyond the boundaries of our personality, but still influenced by it. In this focus, other people can connect with your personality, and share it. So, in effect, you could walk in to someones imagination, or have someone walk in to yours. Things are usually a little more stable, since F3oC isn't in the root of our imagination. In fact, this is a prime focus for predicting future events, as long as you keep an unbiased oppinion.
<br>
<br>
I must admit that I've never been in either of these focuses, so I may have gotten one or two details wrong. This is simply my educated opinion.[/url]

<section>
Liam,
<br>
Although far from qualified, my current thoughts are that f2oc is in fact simply a lucid dream. Wake induced lucid dreams are well known, and the same processes used to induce f2oc have been used for many many years in the induction of WILD's. From descriptions i see no real difference from normal lucid dreams.

There are still those that believe that way. Lately there has been a split, The older and more traditional mystical approaches vs the onward march of the phasing model. Personaly i take what useful information i can out of each model. As mustardseed put it:

 If they are all tools (constructs) to describe an experience that seem to have no real definition or explanation, using the parameters of the known universe we all inhabit, would it not stand to reason that the phasing idea is just another construct?

<br>
All models are somewhat useful in the fact that they allow you to get results, but form your own opinions on which is more accurate

In your 1st phasing experience you were already flying and using telekinesis with full control? That's pretty damn good for 1st try.

<section>
so phasing is like remote viewing, or pure "astral" projection,
<br>
where you create a virtual environment in your head, and  imagine your self in that environment, and you are walking around it.
<br>
<br>
This sounds like "astral projection",  not a real Out of Body experience.
<br>
<br>
Since you get into into a Astral Plane, via Lucid Dreaming, and Projecting
<br>
out of your body into the RTZ first,  phasing just skips the dreaming naturally bit, and skips the out of body in RTZ zone bit.
<br>
<br>
In order words you are creating your own dream environment in the astral by means in pure visualisation, and starting off a lucid dream immediately, rather than waking up lucid and realising it's a dream, in an already astral created environment?
<br>
<br>
So the phasing methods, is like a concious Lucid Dream? (you never get any OBE sensations, you just know you are "Dreaming" from the start )
<br>
<br>
Is that correct?  So  it's like "remote viewing" your own astal built environment?
<br>
<br>
It makes a lot more sense when you think of phasing as a *concious* lucid  dream in a environment you create and "step into" fully concious.
<br>
<br>
It's like lucid dreaming without having to fall asleep first, and realise you are dreaming - you are in astral type environment.
<br>
<br>
Does that mean when in OBE/RTZ going to Astral is going to a place you can actually mentally jump to without actually leaving your body first conciously?
<br>
<br>
I suppose it's like when you are tired, and instantly fall asleep, you can instantly I suppose enter a Lucid Dream place, if you could keep yourself mentally awake.
<br>
<br>
So the question is how do you create a OBE/RTZ once you are lucid in you r own astral created environment?
<br>
<br>
Sounds like a fast method of getting obe if you can figure out how to get into RTZ once in your lucid dream environment?
<br>
<br>
the 180 degree phasing switch bit, must be when you enter Astral so you can create your lucid environment conciously.

The use of a rundown is not required, but it helps. the reason for a rundown is this- the physical consciousness has a really strong grip on us. So to loosen this grip we lay down in the darkness with our eyes closed, with preferabbly no sound(the tapes and stuff work but i go solo, just the way i am) Now once you are laying there you could simply wait for the 3d darkness, or F0 to pop up. This is hard because you keep focusing on your physical body and the sensations that you are recieving. So you create a mental rundown in your head(visualization) to draw your attention away from the physical. THAT is the purpose of the environment, simply to capture your attention so that you can make the "shift" or "phase" from 3rd person, lying there in your bed, to first person, actually INSIDE your environment.

If you are going the mental rundown route, then yes, it would technically be more of an astral projection experience than a OBE. But once you are inside your dream environment it is really easy to go backwards into the RTZ and have a more traditional OBE experience. Or you can simply imagine the place you want to go and you will end up there. OBEs, AP, and phasing are all basically the same thing anyway.

Basically, yep. Another word for phasing could be Wake Induced Lucid Dream(WILD). The reason they are so similar is because astral projection, dreaming, lucid dreaming, etc all take place in the same area of  consciousness.

You could think of it that way. But again, the mental rundown is not necessary, it just helps a whole lot to make the switch from the physical universe to your F2oC(imagination).

The problem here is you are never IN your body to begin with. Even in physical waking life. It just SEEMS that way to us. When you are in the RTZ, switching to an "astral projection" experience is as simple as closing your "eyes" and focusing on a location. Anything else that might happen is simply a manner of bad beliefs and intent- in other words once you realize there is no difference between OBE/AP/LD it becomes a hell of a lot easier to switch between them.

Simply place your intent, close your "eyes" and off you go. its really as simple as that. Like i said before, if it doesnt "work" for you its a manner of belief and intent. Just realize that all these things are connected and switching between say, your room in the RTZ and an AP experience is as easy as WANTING to do it.
