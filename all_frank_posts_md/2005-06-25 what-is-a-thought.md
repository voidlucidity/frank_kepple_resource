Hi people! Is a thought electrochemical activity between neurons? But if we have free will to think what we want then we should be able to decide this process that should start on even a sub atomic level. How can this be done from inside the brain if that control itself is a thinking process? It could mean the brain is a tool for something else?
<br>
<br>
If so, what is a thought? I have studied the mathematics of stocks. It´s clear that people think in some special geometric patterns that repeats. It´s very strange. The buyers and sellers constantly search for reasons for pushing the buy/sell button and totally all these thoughts create geometric structures. Perhaps these structures are visible in other dimensions!?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
To answer your question a thought is a communication.
<br>
<br>
As to stocks, I think Gann was perhaps the forerunner of this weird and whacky idea that a kind of geometry existed in stock-market movements. Pity it only becomes perfectly clear after the event. :)  Would make an interesting discussion but that's way off-topic for this section. But as to thought, as I say it's a communication.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi Frank! What do you mean by communication? Self communication?
<br>
<br>
If everyone knew how to forecast the market the same way then no one could :0)
<br>
<br>
But it should always be possible to forecast if we dig a little bit deeper than the others. It´s just quantification of thoughts i guess. Yes Gann knew alot about this. The saying; "think outside the box" is interesting because this kind of geometry is often visible. The cube i mean. Here´s something i found about the box. I don´t know how true it is.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yes, self communication. Thought is a communication. If I were not so pushed for time right now I'd expand on it but I need to get this Virtual Classroom launched and write the newsletter for the end of the month. So after that, if you are still interested then let's swap a few posts.
<br>
<br>
As regards the forecasting, it's a pity that those pretty diagrams you see on the charts are only available AFTER the event. Gann lines, Cup and Handle formations, Head and Shoulders Tops, etc., etc., it's all AFTER the event. Problem is, stockbrokers, commodity brokers, et al, absolutely insist you trade (gamble) BEFORE the event you are laying your money on. A tad inconvenient, but that's life. It's easy to forget that in the midst of all the mathematical hype.
<br>
<br>
It's like an advert on the Internet I saw last week that stuck in mind. The advert said "Trading the Euro is Easy!" Yes, actually trading the Euro is very easy. But that is not the point. There is a vast difference between trading the Euro and actually making a profit month in month out, from trading the Euro. The latter is the difficult bit and the former is child's play.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Frank! Yes it would be interesting to talk later.
<br>
<br>
Well chart formations like hs and others can work but the hard thing is to know where to have a stop. I know people who have 80-90% profitable trades. Even if they just make 10% losing trades it can cost them to much if they had the stop far away. Some use a good money management method and are constantly profitable but with only 40% profitable trades. But as far as i see right now it seems possible to forecast. Of course it is always about probabilities but an earlier move is related geometrically to a later one. This geometry seems to show up over and over again. Seems like Gann did not like to trade to much. Might be better with just a few forecasts and let the market do it´s job. Some even use astrology for this but i don´t know exactly how it works. Here´s some phi and other geometry related astro site though

But you are right. The brokers are the ones who steal peoples money. Most people lose money in the markets. I lost alot earlier but have studied this for over a year now and hope to make it.
<br>
Stock markets and competition for money is not a good thing of course. It brings the worst things from humanity. Economic growth is just a fraud today. The chip (666 in the bible) is already out there. The company is Verichip and others to. Imagine the control over people!!! Today control is debt and interest. You might have read David Ickes books? They will not succeed because the 911 truth movement is to great out there. It´s all related and ment to steal peoples liberty.  Well now i am far away from thinking :0)
<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts :0)
