hiya
<br>
<br>
I will admit that I don't read much of your posts (or anyone else's for that matter ) since I don't yet feel ready to begin "projecting" .So my question may already be answered by you somewhere among your numerous novels you call posts ( just kidding
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
).
<br>
<br>
In your newsletter you said "objective reality is an objective translation
<br>
of the underlying subjective action" . I'm not able to pinpoint as to what exactly is bothering me with that explanation but I will try .
<br>
<br>
*If I understand what you are saying , then physical world ( for example ) is only a manifestation of our own consciousness and thus I can view objectively ( to a point since experiencing this world first hand via my body means I'm viewing it subjctively ) the actions of my own consciousness ( at least part or even area responsible for all physical ) which of course by definition is always subjective ?
<br>
<br>
*And speaking of physical , who exactly is responsible for physical world ? You or I or did our minds somehow managed to get togehter or ... ( see the question below ) ?
<br>
<br>
*If we must always travel within us and thus nothing exists outside our consciousness , wouldn't that indicate that somehow my consciousness occupies or exists in your consciousness also and vice-versa ?
<br>
<br>
The following question also has to do with something you said in newsletter :
<br>
"The obstacles in thinking people have are :
<br>
2) People objectify everything "
<br>
<br>
Now what exactly you mean by that ?
<br>
<br>
I sure hope you can clear this up for me since I do plan to follow your book , but it would make it that more difficult without understanding the basics
<br>
<br>
cheers

<section>
frank you could at least tell me why you didn't bother to answer my questions , since you have to admit it you have no problem posting novels in here on almost daily basis . So why does it become a problem  when someone asks ( that would be me ) you to explain it in order to be able to follow your book when it does eventually come out ? Are questions that stupid ... ?
<br>
<br>
And BTW ,I did check your topics in Permanent astral topics and Astral FAQ and no ,my questions aren't answered there !

I thought they were good questions, perhaps he just missed this thread?  Believe me, I do that all the time.

I'm sorry, I am at a loss to explain why I have overlooked this thread. I would like to express that I am on dial-up and I do not have the luxury of working "on screen" as it were. Posts do get missed, unfortunately, as by the time I come back to my screen the "latest posts" feature has refreshed itself.
<br>
<br>
I can understand your frustration and again I can only apologise for having overlooked it. You are quite correct, I have answered a number of posts at length following yours. I assure you it is nothing personal. I would like to suggest to anyone who feels they may have been overlooked on a Phasing question to please post a PM to jog my memory.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Mayhap you answer them here so to insure that if anyone else has these questions you won't be inundated with the same questions in a PM?  Ok, not to mention.....I'm curious too!
<br>
<br>
Just a thought.

That thought never crossed my mind since the two of us haven't really spoke ( once or twice maybe )

In any case , I would really appreciate if my questions are answered

I never could quite settle with Frank's vision of reality.  I think his definition of subjective and objective reality is different than mine though.

Yeah, I used to feel the same way about Frank's model ... but it turned out I just didn't understand it. I'll reserve my opinions on the nature of reality for when I've accumulated a broader depth of experience.

<section>
The topic 'Drugs' ended with a discussion where Frank went into detail on this, but the posts ended up getting deleting as they were posted after the last back-up before the recent server problems.
<br>
<br>
My memory is fuzzy, and hopefully Frank will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think he said that pretty much nothing here exists truly objectively, except energy and other 'people'. It's how we interpret the energy that causes it to take form as it does. Ie, objectively there is no computer screen in front of you right now. It's, as Frank has put it, a 'heap of energy' that you have accepted as a computer screen, and 'creation' was something similarly decided upon and accepted, and thus energy took its course.
<br>
<br>
I would assume, from how we all seem to interpret the energy similarly and agree on the nature of objects, that it's collective at the very least to a degree. But from certain comments Frank has made (ie being able to overcome gravity and levitate being possible), it also seems as though he's suggesting we can alter the 'rules' on an individual basis if we overcome the mental constructs we have developed as to what can or cannot be. If that's the case, then some of the things Jesus purportedly did would suddenly fit with his reputation as a spiritual teacher, and String Theory would be on the right track after all. And that's about all I'm going to give a shot at clarifying.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thank you to all for your observations. I'm a bit pushed for time to answer this at present as it's quite a complex question.
<br>
<br>
I have touched on this before in some detail and it would appear some of the posts have been lost. I'll do my best to try to recap from my notes over the next few days as the question of subjective and objective both in terms of awareness and in terms of the translation of energy is quite a complex topic, particularly the latter. Though I believe the former is what is being asked about by the original poster which makes it easier to encapsulate.
<br>
<br>
The latter I will be making the subject of a series of newsletters. It is too in depth to go into in one go, and way too much for a post to a thread here.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

You mean, basically, "The Matrix"?  It has to be a bit more complicated than that though or else people on lsd would fly.

actually taking lsd forces your awareness into F2. so if you were to lay down and close your eyes you could create a mental rundown that would be a helluva lot of fun. that is why taking drugs is such a subjective thing- it takes place within your own F2. But as far as the physical F1 goes, lsd doesnt affect  the "rules" of the game a bit.

 That's a great summary of my interpretation of things.  Good post.
 <br>
 <br>
 And to answer the flying on LSD, I think the answer is about:
 <br>
 <i>
  that it's collective at the very least to a degree
 </i>
 <br>
 <br>
 In order to accomplish the things Jesus purportedly did, you would have to have an accurate
 <i>
  knowing
 </i>
 of reality that is beyond this illusionary collective creation.
 <br>
 <br>
 First of all, in order to accurately function through a physical vehicle, your perspective would have to be entrenched in this physical "collective" in order to hold it together during the first stages of your "unknowing of reality" that occurs in the early years of your current physical incarnation.  If you knew everything from the beginning, you wouldn't be able to take advantage of the "Earth School", cause it would no longer be a purely physical experience, a vital part of the illusion.
 <br>
 <br>
 The "Not Knowing" is part of the process.  As you are moving through time in this incarnation, you would have to "evolve" in your understanding of how this system works to not only be able to "see" what the system is made up of, but how it works and how it can be manipulated
 <i>
  while you are still participating in the system
 </i>
 physically.
 <br>
 <br>
 In other words, you would have to have enough faith in the illusion of reality to believe it is real so you can hold onto your physical, and at the same time, have enough faith in the illusion of the system to realize it is an illusion you make up and can alter.  Then, you have to have enough
 <i>
  knowing
 </i>
 of the system and its functions to be able to manipulate it, and have enough power over the collective to adjust its perspective into believing your created illusion is more real than their previously created beliefs/reality.  A tall order.
 <br>
 <br>
 I think that once a specific soul reaches the point of knowing the system in this way, the traumas of physical life become trivial to them, and they lose interested in the system, they evolve past it knowing that the trauma is part of the learning your soul is utilizing, and they decide to move on to other experiences.
