This is a link I picked up off of Bruce Moen's site. There were some testimonials. Has anyone heard of this?

Hi Nick.
<br>
<br>
I was drawn to this a while ago but lost the link so thank you for posting it. It seems like a more straightforward version of Monroe's gateway series (and cheaper!).Im going to read through it again and see if I feel compelled to buy
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///it.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
would be great if anyone here has used this "awakened minds" and could relate their experiences.
<br>
<br>
Take care

Parmenion,
<br>
<br>
Yes, one thing that struck me is that they don't try to sell you a whole series of pricey "levels". Just one cd for around forty dollars. The other thing that might be a plus for some, is that one would be getting the disc without anyone talking on it. Just the tones and the rainfall.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Thanks, Nick, for the link. I got a feeling I should look into this as it might provide another (somewhat cheaper) mental-rundown example. So a CD is on it's way to me. Not sure how long it will take, exactly.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi everyone,
<br>
I have been using the Insight program cd for a month now and with very good results. When I first got interest on Astral travel and heard about the Gateway program I got curious about all this technological approach to meditation and the effect on Brain waves so after some research there was some possibilities (Gateway, Centerpoint, Brainsync and the insight program).
<br>
<br>
To me the insight program was the one more appealing in terms of value, I can not compare since I didn't do any of the others but the insight is a single CD with 3 tracks, the 1st takes your mind from a high alpha state to a deep delta state, the 2nd track keeps your mind in that delta state for the full 24 minutes and then the 3rd track begins in that delta state and brings your mind slowly back to a alpha state leaving you very relaxed.
<br>
<br>
With the practice you keep your mind very alert during the full cession, which is a good thing for all the A.P. work.
<br>
<br>
My personal experience is that I very much enjoy the listening time and the deep physical relaxation feeling that this program gives, I did not yet try to consciously project because I'm doing the NEW energy work and some pranayama as a preparation (following the Astral Dynamics workbook) but the last weeks every time I finish the program I lay down and relax/sleep for some time (20/30 min). And always get lucid dreams, where I am very much conscious of being asleep or dreaming. A very good feeling.
<br>
Until now it happened once that during the listening time (I was laying, normally I do it sitting in a meditative posture) I actually felt my body floating upwards bat when I "saw" it stop!
<br>
<br>
I guess that the effect must be very similar to the other programs where after some time 3-4 months practice you will be able to induce the state by your self. What I want to try is do some yoga, pranayama, listen to the cd and lay down and off to RTZ! J
<br>
<br>
I hope this may be of some help.
<br>
Regards
<br>
Vasco

Frank- I agree, it's would be hard to pass on this cd given the relatively low price. The comparison descriptions (against the other companies) was quite persuasive, so I ordered a cd too. Hopefully, it will result in another mental-rundown example as you stated in your post.
<br>
<br>
belgarath- The insight cd information was something I just happened upon and look forward to giving it a try in my astral phasing program. Happy to read you've gotten good results with it so far in your astral work.

Hi Nick, Frank,
<br>
<br>
Did you guys receive your cd's?
<br>
<br>
If so, what do think of them?
<br>
<br>
I ordered one yesterday.  Can't wait to try it out.

Lasher,
<br>
<br>
Yes, I received the CD a few weeks ago. I've been using it and have gotten used to the gentle rainfall that masks the frequencies. There is no voice that interupts and I especially like that. The disc seems to help take me to a deep state so I guess it is working.
<br>
<br>
What I have been working on is a mental rundown (as Frank mentions doing in his posts). I'll spend more time with the CD and perhaps do a follow-up post later with my thoughts. However, so far I am glad I bought the disc.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Hi All
<br>
<br>
I`ve been listening to the awakened minds CD for about three weeks and find it a nice change from Gateway.I like the hypnotic effect of the rainfall which seems to produce a quick smooth path to higher focus levels.I seem to always come back to C1 after about 40 minutes but that may be a result of having the Gateway timeframe ingrained by now.I think it gives good value.
<br>
<br>
Happy Trails

I've been using the Awakened Minds CD for several weeks now and I works very well for me.  I'm not yet a successful OBER, but it helps me get to a deep state of meditation.

<section>
Lasher,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting the follow-up. It has prompted me to post one also. My impression is that the Awakened Minds CD is a great CD. Also, I have found that the
<i>
 Deep Meditation
</i>
CD from Brain Sync is great too.
<br>
<br>
The only difference that I found is that one masks the frequencies with rainfall (awakened minds) and the other with a kind of "celestial" new age type music. However, I've found that I have been able to hear the actual binaural frequencies in the Brain Sync CD. I like that for some reason.
<br>
<br>
Both of these are good in my opinion because there are no voices on them, just the binaural frequencies, and either the rainfall or the music. They are each reasonably priced as well. The Brain Sync one costs $14.95 (USD).
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.brainsync.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.brainsync.com/
</a>
<br>
<br>
The use of the CD is good sometimes to get one to the proper mind-awake/body-asleep state. Other times I will go without the CD, it just depends on what kind of way I'm feeling. All in all, it's nice to have because the binaural frequencies really do seem to have the effect of taking one to that F10/mind-awake/body-asleep level.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

I was listening to the sample of the Awakened Minds program and noticed something. While listening to the rain-like noises, there was almost an overlap of high frequency noise that hurt my ears. Does anyone know why this might be happening?

<section>
dino333,
<br>
<br>
That is something I have not experienced with the Awakened Minds CD. The only thing I could really hear was the rainfall. Perhaps someone else may know the answer.

<br>
I have not tried this cd yet but I have noticed with other binaural/meditation cds that they do give me a headache at times and I am not able to listen to them.
<br>
<br>
Why this is, I do not know. [?][?]  I know that I have sensitive hearing so maybe that has something do with it.
