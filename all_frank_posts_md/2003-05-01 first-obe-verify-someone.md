<section>
I've been working on a portfolio for a review since about 2 weeks ago, and today I just got exhausted from the entire thing.  I came back from class feeling like I was going to have an out of body experience standing up, but I sat down, had some food, and finished my project.  I decided, at that point, to get some sleep, so I laid down.  Of course, in my state of mind, I wasn't really wanting to sleep, so I started meditating, and visualized myself at the beach.  I really felt like I was there this time, and then I snapped back to myself spinning around in a circle of energy type deal.  I tried the rope method really fast, but then just kind of dozed off for a second.  When I snapped back out of the doze state, I felt myself moving around, and I got the exit symptoms.  There was a surge of energy throughout my body, and I encouraged it to spread everywhere.  When it did, I kept visualizing myself in another environment, and suddenly I began to feel some very strong vibrations.  At this point, something really hard to explain happened, and I can see why the authors have such an interesting time writing about it.  I was having an out of body experience...but it wasn't what I expected at all.  It was like being in a 3d movie theater where you have complete clarity of everything going on.  I felt disoriented, and I shouted for clarity.  Surprisingly, it worked, and I could see beyond the darkness.  I was at my house, about 50 miles from where I am at school, and I was moving behind my dad (I think...might've just been a fluctuation though...I didn't call to actually see where he was at that time).  At this point, I darted up the stairs and to my mom's room, but quickly came back down and through the wall to the other side.  I couldn't hold the state for too long and at this point I became aware of my physical body again.  I could see the outline of the room, and I felt that even though I had my eyes closed, I was surrounded by some kind of, for the sake of a better term, bubble - like, usually when you have your eyes closed, it's a 2d space, but this was still the 3d space.  At this point, I snapped up out of bed and wrote this down (in a very excited manner, might I add)...what does everyone think?

From the description of your experience it certainly apears that you Did have an out of body experience! Very good!
<br>
In some ways your first projection was also above 'average'.
<br>
Most first time projectors (myself included) are confined to their room or house/apartment. The fact that you transported to a location 50 miles away And stayed calm and in control is a positive sign.
<br>
Many (or most) first time projectors (myself included) project either from a dream, from dreamless sleep or right after waking up and in sleep paralysis. So it's another positive sign of being able to consciously project from a state of deep meditation. Many experienced projectors are still not able to do that!

In answer to your question, I think what you experienced is typical of what can happen in the early stages. Everything is a bit confusing, you get disorientated and tend to flit here and there. It's interesting where you say, "
<i>
 but it wasn't what I expected at all. It was like being in a 3d movie theater where you have complete clarity of everything going on.
</i>
" People often report that it wasn't what they expected to the extent where I often wonder what
<u>
 did
</u>
they expect.
<br>
<br>
Like with most things, practice makes perfect. Such that you will find, if you keep having these experiences, everything tends to smooth out as you gradually learn how to apply ever higher degrees of control. It is possible to eventually reach the stage where you attain the same degree of clarity and control as you would normally have while awake and alert within the Physical. The key to doing that is keeping a high degree of control over your thoughts. Which is one of those things that's ever so easy to say, but darned tricky to do
<u>
 at the time
</u>
.

<br>
Best of luck and welcome to the BBS.

I agree with frank, you want to eliminate the projection of the mind you have to eliminate those ego's and thoughts to have better ap's only way to do it is by staying during the daytime in a alertness state, like being wide awake and alert of your 5 senses, not let yourself get engulfed in anything you do and not daydream and also not to think and if you do come back to awareness/alertness, if you still have trouble understanding you can enrol at

they have free courses on it.  I also notice what helped you succeed is the same technique I use which is you didn't sleep much only partially and kept yourself awake throughout the day.  They have said
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///lucidity.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 lucidity.com
</a>
faq that you have more than 50% chance of being lucid in dreams by going to sleep for say 5hours wakeup stay awake for atleast 30mins to an hour wash your face etc. then drop back to sleep.  What I did for example yesterday is that technique only I didn't keep my awareness as much high, so I can fall asleep more faster, as soon as the dream images started to kick in I switched to awareness/alert mode like as if you were sleeping all of a sudden you force yourself to wakeup like an alarm clock going off, what happened is I started to pay attention to the images being in a wakeful mode then I said this is all fake in back of my head all of a sudden dream disappeared and i was in my room looking through my closed eyes, I tried to move out slowly couldn't was then sucked back in a dream again I then i snapped back my awareness thing again was back in my bedroom and got out.
