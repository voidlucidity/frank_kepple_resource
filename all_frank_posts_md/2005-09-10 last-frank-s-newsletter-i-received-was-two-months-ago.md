Let's make this interesting and in line with the goals of this forum.
<br>
<br>
Some of us should volunteer to try to contact Frank by means of wider reality and discern the reasons for his absence. I'll volunteer, but I'd be more motivated if others did it as well so that we could compare our experiences.

Good question Mactombs.  I suspect that we would have to ask for non-physical assistance on this one.   Boy, wouldn't it be something if some of us could actually find him?  Especially if it could be verified.

At the same time we would also be proving Monroe and Moen's point that privacy is an illusion!!

Tee hee...wonder what Frank would have to say about that.

I have a curious feeling that Frank will be back sooner rather than later...

People on the Virtual Classroom list got an email from Frank last night. He was out of commission for a while but it appears he will be back shortly. I imagine that means he will have time to visit this forum again, but he didn't specifically say that.

I had a dream last night that I was attending a lecture by Frank. It (the lecture) was about the nature of time.
<br>
<br>
I don't think it answered anything in respect to the reason for finding Frank, but it's interesting that I dreamed it anyway.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I do sincerely apologise for the lack of newsletters but it is a fact that I have been enduring some rather serious personal problems of late. I truly am sorry if this has inconvenienced you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I don't mean this to sound mushy, but the fact is that you have a lot of forum friends here who care about you and your well-being.  You already know this I am sure, but in my experience, this is one of the most powerful forces there is.  All the best to you.
