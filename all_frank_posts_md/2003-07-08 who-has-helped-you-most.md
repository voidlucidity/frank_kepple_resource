<section>
I am curious what users you think have helped you the most?
<br>
<br>
For me Tom has helped me a lot, but since Tom does not frequent the forum anymore timeless has stepped up to take his place.

<section>
a lot of people's posts have changed my ways of thinking and views on things, etc.. just random posts by different members, and i'm like.. "woah.. never thought of it that way".. that's what kicks butt about this forum. frank and inguma are especially helpful a lot of the time, for me at least. but i'm just one person out of some thousands signed up here [

   Retired - Tom.  Tom was always there, inputting his own words without taking sides.  He never took part in arguments, yet seemed to be able to stop them with one simple post.  He has so much knowledge and information to share with everybody here.  It was a sad day when he posted "I feel like I've been spending too much time here, too many posts.  I'm going to take a break for a while."  We all kinda figured "Awhile" was a few days, a weeks tops.  It's been months..
   <br>

   Active - Adrian.  Keeping it real all the time, Stickying the things that are most relevant, Moderating at times of need, and just keeping this site up and running all the time.  Thanks man!

We each arrived here at the Astral Pulse with our individual life and spiritual experiences. Some will ask about OBE's or astral phasing, others about lucid dreams or energy work, for example. When it comes to advice or help in a particular matter we post our question and hopefully come away with some good advice.
<br>
<br>
As no leaf mentioned, sometimes the advice comes from someone you don't expect, and it can powerfully alter your view.
<br>
<br>
So that being said, I have to say the same is true for me. There have been a lot of you that have touched me with your insights and caring manner. There are names that come to mind on a variety of subjects that I've corresponded and traded posts with. A lot of you.
<br>
<br>
The question then, is who helped the most. For me, my primary interest in coming here was astral work. I learned astral phasing due to the posts I read and traded with Frank. For that I am most grateful. Since I came to the forum with an interest in AP, that help has been most appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Along the way however, I've read a lot of posts in every forum category
<u>
 and have been helped from all of you
</u>
. I've come to realize what a remarkable forum this is. Here we are, from all over the world, sharing information and insights on a variety of spiritual matters. How nice is that?
<br>
<br>
Very best,

I don't wish to gush gratuitous prais on anyone in particular, however Frank and Adrian together have given me some wonderful and valuable guidance, and a really big two thumbs up definitely goes to Robert Bruce. His article "The Catchbasket Concept" was the real turning point for me. It helped me let go of a belief system I had been lugging around with me because I thought I should, and breaking it down opened up a whole new world for me.
<br>
<br>
To give credit where credit is due though, everybody that I've interacted with on this forum over the past 15 months or so has helped me to view things in a different way, and help my mind not to become stuck in a narrow little box of limited thinking.
<br>
<br>

Robert Bruce. I do not agree with him on everything, but he has made everything much more
<i>
 real
</i>
to me. It used to be so esoteric, but when he speaks of astral projection or energy work, I'm thankful he doesn't go off about the finer details or chakra names or whatever.

<br>
For me, it has to be Robert Bruce as it was he who introduced me to this BBS originally; together with a big thumbs-up to Adrian for dealing with all the technicalities. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to say
<u>
 thank-you
</u>
to anyone else who has spent valuable time working "behind the scenes" so to speak.
<br>
<br>
As regards the forum generally, I can't put it any better than Nick where he says, "I've come to realize what a remarkable forum this is. Here we are, from all over the world, sharing information and insights on a variety of spiritual matters. How nice is that?"
<br>
<br>
I think that's marvellous... and it sure beats fighting each other.

Timeless,
<br>
<br>
*Scarily* sounds like a good useable word!
<br>
Physically and geographically we are very different, but I'm thinking maybe we see things through the same eyes. Perhaps our souls have intermingled some time past?
<br>
<br>
This forum has many wonderful people with whom you can share thoughts and experiences that you would possibly hesitate to tell even your closest companion.
<br>

I would have to agree with No leaf.. I have recieved help from many on these forums, over the few months I have been here!
<br>
<br>
Frank, with his way of explaining, has been great in helping me understand things I thought I would never get!
<br>
<br>
Timeless, with her kind, patient and understanding ways..she has a nac for making you look within yourself.
<br>
<br>
Nick, with his never ending knowledge of every link you would ever need to know..I have found endless amount of info this way!
<br>
<br>
Squeek, with his quiet or not so quiet..lol..post which seem to be getting wiser and wiser as the days go by.
<br>
<br>
Ginny, what can I say..she is a jewel and I hope to follow in her footsteps when it comes to love for helping people on the "other side"
<br>
<br>
Krome, Wow! no lack of laughing there! I feel a closeness to him, I think due to the fact we both came here around the same time, and clung to each other like scared little kids entering a new and wonderous world.
<br>
<br>
Lasher, anyone who can post a picture of there self in a cow print cowboy hat..has my love!
<br>
<br>
There are plenty more but those are the ones that stick out in my mind right now..I just want to think everyone on this forum for their individual input..it has been a great help!
<br>
<br>
P.S..I also want to think my worn out Webster Dictionary whom without, my post would have been hard to make sense of!! whoo hoo.
<br>
<br>

I would say that those that have helped me the most are Robert Bruce, Frank, and Tom. Though everyone on the board whether we agree or not has been of help to me. I have been away for some time, what like a year, so there are a lot of new names around here. Hopefully we can all be of help to each other. I feel that as we interact we all influence each other in some way, even ways we may not see at the time can have a big influence on our lives.
<br>
<br>
Peace and Love to all

My big helper has been ME! (Vigerously patting self on back.)
<br>
<br>
But all seriousness aside.  [

]
<br>
<br>
I will not point out any one person, aside from myself of course, because to do so would be unfair to those whom I am unable to name at this time.  I have name memory problems.  But for the most part I consider the forums a seperate entity and we are all a part of that entity.  So information I gleen from a part is contributed to the whole.  Even the so called "newbies" are an important part of the entire structure.  They are often the ones that re-introduce us to our older thought patterns, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow I'll stop typing now....It's difficult to do with one hand, and my head is starting to get in the way.

On a serious note too many people to name have helped me.  Anyone who took the time out to answer a question or give an opinion has helped in some way.  I really do value this place as being full of information and good advice.

I couldn't separate or single one person out because as I see it we all have our parts to play, to give interest and balance.

I am very grateful to you all for your help, knowledge and humour

Robert, Frank and Adrian have all provided me with invaluable information.  I think every member has something unique to offer, even if it is a question and not an answer.
