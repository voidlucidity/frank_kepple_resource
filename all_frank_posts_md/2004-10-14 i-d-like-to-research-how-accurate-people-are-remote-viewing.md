<section>
With remote viewing or astral projection,
<br>
try to see the two digit number I placed in front of my computer.
<br>
It is written on the back of my business card that has been ripped in half.
<br>
The 2 numbers are written in numeral English sign from between 1 and 99.
<br>
The number will remain there until someone comes up with the correct answer.
<br>
What two digit number do you think it is?
<br>
I will reply when a post usually daily or after each post as to whether your seeing is accurate and tell you honestly you got the number or not until someone sees the correct number.
<br>
Okay?
<br>
This could be fun. Really. And, a learning experience for all of us.
<br>

I'm not a remote viewer but from what I understand of it, numbers are the hardest things to RV.
<br>
<br>
You'll have a lot better accuracy using things that involve tactile sensations or are personally important to someone.
<br>
<br>
For instance a wedding ring or a leather wallet would get better results.

most RV'ers here can't just empathically connect or connect via your energy signiture, so if you could then please give us an idea of "where we need to be looking."

Hi Everyone,
<br>
<br>
Well, I'm not sure if I did this experiment right.
<br>
I was not notified of the most recent replies to the remote viewing experiment, but I just checked in and saw there were more replies so I thought I'd respond.
<br>
<br>
First off I have to tell you, that I asked an old friend to guess the number over the phone. We live on opposite coasts.
<br>
<br>
He was only 1 number off. He guessed 27 and
<b>
 the number in front of my computer is actually 28.
</b>
So I guess, those who had at least a 2 in their seeing were partially right.
<br>
<br>
And maybe the 13 could be seen as visually seeing the right half in the 8 in 28 and seeing the 1 in 13 as half of the 2 in numeral qualities.
<br>
<br>
I can see that all who guessed were very close to the number. None of you offered a number over 42. That's wonderful. Thank you for sharing.
<br>
<br>
Congratulations to you all for even trying and getting it at least partially correct. Cheers to you.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Thank you all for trying out seeing remotely.
</b>
I figure even though it is not easy to trail an electronic posting back to it's originator we might as well try to experiment with it, as I don't think the Internet is going away any time soon.
<br>
Energy is energy, although there are many different levels or powers of it.
<br>
<br>
I was wondering.
<br>
I'm rather new to this forum/board and have not read it as extensively as I could have by now,
<b>
 but is this the best topic area to post this type of question?
</b>
What is better?
<br>
Maybe next time I will try it with something more tactile as suggested.

<section>
Yeah, I think this is a great experiment and training and testing and refining our skills/abilities.  I think we should be doing a lot more games/experiments of this nature, as the more we practice...the better we should get, right?  This is fun stuff to me.
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Also, I might mention that I was the closest, numerically, if that counts for anything(of these posters).
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I think we should do this same experiment every week with a different number until we start to get really good at it!

<section>
Hi Everyone,
<br>
OK, since we are over the number remote viewing thingy, I've decide to try a new test for everybody on remote viewing.
<br>
It is not a number this time as many people were not comfortable with this.
<br>
This time it is an object.
<br>
I will place it in front of my computer, located in the west end of Beaverton, Oregon, to give you a hint on "where to look."
<br>
Let me go pick an object now.
<br>
<br>
OK, I picked the object.
<br>
<br>
To Give You More Hints, energies of Where to Look -  I will include the following details so you can "tune in" your remote viewing energies, however they work.
<br>
<br>
I have owned "it" - the object - for over 7 years.
<br>
I bought it in a shopping mall.
<br>
It is in front of my black computer monitor that was purchased less than a year ago.
<br>
It is on the second floor of a single detached house.
<br>
The computer room, second bedroom, is on the east side of the house.
<br>
It is not large.
<br>
There is nothing else by the object, just a flat wood table the monitor sits on.
<br>
<br>
Okay, that's probably enough hints for you without giving it away.
<br>
<br>
If you can tune into my energy, and what I described, please try to tell me what it is, or some kind of description about it, Whatever comes to mind.
<br>
<br>
I do agree this is fun, and hones our skills. I appreciate the feedback as does everyone.
<br>
<br>
We can see as clearly as we can see, and to share we dearly be(e).
<br>
<br>
I will try to check in every day on the replies to this post, and I think about three days would probably be long enough of an experiment so you don't forget about it or anything.
<br>
<br>
Any way, following the energy of this electronic and whatever else you consider it post, try to see the object now in front of my computer monitor.
<br>
<br>
I will check back and keep you updated on the most closest seeing responses as best I can without giving away the answer as to what it is.
<br>
<br>
Thank you every one for participating.

I'd like to try a general remote viewing exercise here for 3 days of asking you to try to remote see the object in front of my computer monitor.
<br>
Hints as to "where to look".
<br>
<br>
My computer monitor is black.
<br>
It sits on a wood table.
<br>
The object is placed in front of it and nothing else is in front of the computer monitor except the black keyboard with white type.
<br>
The computer and monitor and object I chose for you to try to see, sits on a wood table on a second floor office, on the west coast of America.
<br>
<br>
Any replies will be appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for participating in remote seeing experiment.
<br>
It's been three days so, it's time to reveal what it was.
<br>
<br>
The second object after the 28, was a small crystal pyramid.
<br>
This small crystal(?) like pyramid is like 1 and a 1/3 inches on each side of its base. It is about 1 &amp; 1/3 inches high.
<br>
The pyramid has ridges in it flowing downwards.
<br>
<br>
And, to the remote seer (SP?), who kept asking if it was red...
<br>
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
The pyramid I HAVE, actually CLEAR GLASS OR CRYSTAL, and the reflection in the top half or so of the pyramid is seen as red.
<br>
By the way, it is mostly seen as green in the lower half of the pyramid.
<br>
There is also seen some blue and yellow when seen at different angles and light.
<br>
<br>
Congratulations on getting the red part right. It's the first thing you see when you look at it from sitting in front of the computer.
<br>
<br>
Way to see
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
<br>
I WILL NOW CHOOSE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO REMOTE VIEW
<br>
<br>
OK, I've picked it.
<br>
<br>
Again, as to where to look, I am on the west coast of America at around the 45th parallel. West of Portland, Oregon about 15 miles.
<br>
<br>
The object is now sitting right in front of the black computer monitor stand, on a wood grain table.
<br>
<b>
 OK, besides location I would like to give three hints as to what to look for
</b>
<br>
<br>
*
<b>
 Colors?
</b>
would be an appropriate Remote Viewing (looking for),
<br>
* as well as
<b>
 what certain words appear on this object?
</b>
<br>
* maybe, if you can see
<b>
 what scene that appears on this object?
</b>
<br>
<br>
I guess by giving you hints on one hand I'm helping you what to look for and where.
<br>
I hope I'm not revealing too much, please tell me. Maybe just one or two hints? I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out what's the best way to test remote viewing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any shared information will be appreciated.
<br>
<br>
The answer will not be revealed beyond what "clues" I wrote until three days have passed.
<br>
<br>
Then, after about three days,  I will reveal in this topic post what newest choice was below the computer monitor.
<br>
<br>
Please share your impressions.
<br>
<br>
And, Thank you for sharing your Remote Viewing - SEEING impressions you have of this newest object in advance.
<br>
<br>
This is really fun and quite a learning experience.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.

<section>
Hey,
<br>
<br>
I don't think any clues are necessary, except maybe the location of where you put the object.  That way we are free to let our minds wander and not let our logical minds try to figure it out by narrowing it down with the clues.
<br>
<br>
By the way,  I did guess a geometric shape last time and it was...just a different shape.  Maybe we could also relay our feelings on each object... as sometimes our feelings are right but our visions may not be.
<br>
<br>
Also maybe you could also do a number along with each object...as I think the number game is pretty fun too.
<br>
<br>
All be well...
<br>
<br>
........Right now my mind is thinking "snow storm"...let me think about it some more

OK times up for the third experiment in remote viewing.
<br>
The item was too much in some manners.
<br>
<br>
3 or 4 days have passed and it's time to tell you what the object I chose was.
<br>
<br>
The third object chosen was a cassette tape holder box album cover with the number 5 predominately displayed.
<br>
<br>
The other numbers on the cassette tape album cover were 61 as in 61 minutes.
<br>
<br>
It was album 5 (LABELED AT TOP RIGHT OF ALBUM IN RED) in the meditation music cassette series that began with the lead title.
<br>
<br>
Covelo - You are really good on number seeing as you got the 5 and 6 right.
<br>
<br>
The object has 4 sides as it is rectangular in shape.
<br>
<br>
Good Seeing.
<br>
<br>
And for the one who thought it was a post card. This album cover could be a really good postcard cover and I see why you might say that with your impressions.

remote Seeing more clearly.
<br>
<br>
I am trying to keep the new object out from under the computer monitor so it will be more easily seen by out of body experimenters who remote see.
<br>
<br>
I just recently read that remote viewers are more likely to see through out of body experiences, views of the object being identified, from an overhead or on-top view.
<br>
<br>
I have picked the fourth object in this remote viewing topic.
<br>
<br>
What do you see in front of the monitor NOW?
<br>
<br>
Please post. It can be fun for all of us, sharing our thoughts.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
<br>
Me.

Hi Aura.,
<br>
<br>
I would like to suggest that you also keep trying to send anyone 'viewing' a mental picture and description of the object in question.  That way we will all be more linked in mind and help us to connect and become better communicators with each other as well.
<br>
<br>
Everyone else:
<br>
<br>
I would also like to try an experiment.  I am sending you all a mental picture of something I am thinking of right now and I am looking at it now too.  Let me know what I'm thinking and looking at, if you think you're getting my message.
<br>
<br>
I have been learning that I may have an exceptional ability to project my thoughts and I'd just like to test this out now.
<br>
<br>
All be well...

I think I see a circular shaped statue on a pedestal of some type, something that is blue, like a wave.
<br>
I got the impression it was on a bureau of some type.
<br>
<br>
When will you let us know?

In a couple days or so, I guess.

<br>
I'll not say anything else about it 'til then so others can post.

 42, the room was dark and I saw the number on the bottom right corner...

 I am not the best at RV'ing but decided to give it a shot.

Hi Y'all,
<br>
<br>
This post was moved by someone (a moderator??? to general metaphysics from astral consciousness.
<br>
Whoever did this moving, could you please post some kind of message on the post to let people know it moved? Maybe start with the post title and then maybe once you open the topic say something like, "This topic has been moved to..." So people know where to go.
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
<br>
I have decided to end with remote viewing experiment number 5 early.
<br>
It has been suggested to me that it would be best to just do 1 remote viewing experiment per thread, so it's not so lengthy.
<br>
So, thank you, I will do that.
<br>
<br>
The 5th object in the experiment in remote viewing (at least for this thread) was an ordinary everyday spoon. Like the kind you use to stir your coffee. This spoon has a white plastic type handle and the spoon is stainless steel. It is of average size.
<br>
<br>
There's no other way I can describe it.
<br>
<br>
Thank you all for trying.
<br>
<br>
Any other remote viewing experiments posted by me will be in this
