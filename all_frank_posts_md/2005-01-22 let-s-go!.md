Hey Everybody..

<br>
<br>
Just a brief note to say hello and thank everyone for this site.  I've not worked with Astral Travel yet, but I have dedicated this year to it.
<br>
<br>
By way of intro I can also link to this page entitled -

Looking forward to getting to know everyone.  Thanks for having me in.

Hey Gang...
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much for the welcome.  I picked up Astral Dynamics about a year ago, but am only now getting to it.  I also ordered the 90 day course and am currently awaiting that.
<br>
<br>
In the meantime I've been looking over the site - listening to the interviews - and I've been doing some of the initial energy work.  Already, I'm having wonderful progress with that.
<br>
<br>
Just can't wait to do more.

Thanks so much for making this available - to everyone. And Cheers!

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I wish you all the best in finding your way through the minefield, lol. We're not a bad bunch. Our accumulative knowledge means there is almost always someone who has come across the same obstacle and gotten around it by some means.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
