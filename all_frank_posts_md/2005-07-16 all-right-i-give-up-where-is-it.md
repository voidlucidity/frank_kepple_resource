<br>
In the FAQ section in the What Is Phasing? post. I talk about it there. Sorry you've had all the hassle.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

 Well, nothing at first, there’s not much to see really but blackness. But then, after a short while, I may see that perhaps one part of the blackness is not quite so black. Perhaps there was just a brief flash of something, then maybe a sensation of a movement somewhere else. Maybe I just heard someone call my name. Hmm, that’s interesting, I might think, I wonder where that came from. But I don’t get too curious I just keep noticing. I might see swirling areas of not quite so black as the rest. I might see flashes of this and that. As I am offering myself these images, my attention is steadily becoming more fixated within.
 <br>
 <br>
 As my attention becomes fixated within, from the act of noticing, at this stage I am not aware of my physical body. Part of my awareness realises that somewhere in the background is a physical body, in bed, etc. but I have phased away from it. Before, the forefront of my awareness was my physical and 180 degrees turned around from that, in the background of my awareness, was the non-physical. But now there has been a “phase shift” i.e. a turning through 180 degrees. Now, my previous foreground (physical) is my background, and my previous background (non-physical) is my foreground.

Is this it?

Tried it last night, very relaxing. After a while I saw a face and my eyes freaked out flying all over the place... this is gonna take some practise

I ha vent done this in a while, but typically when i focus on the back of my eyelids i start seeing faces after a while.  Usually in greyscale, or at least what i could only describe as being... er...  ethereal?
<br>
<br>
They aren't in colour.  Usually a shiny Grey/white scale of colour that gives some surprising definition.  Once or twice they have been a brown colour that's extremely close to a gold sheen.
<br>
<br>
I find i can focus on them, by bringing them into more of a priority, but if i make an 'alert' observation of them, that is to say i try too hard to focus on them, they go away.
<br>
<br>
They typically mouth words or make expressions, but that's about it.
<br>
<br>
I was just extremely curious to note you have had a similar experience...
<br>
<br>
Anyone else?

just the other day on a ride back from a 2 day canoe trip i was basically doing the noticing exercise and i began seeing all kinds of faces and such.  its happened many times before but this time they were clearer.  like movies in gray scale.  i saw a guy fly fishing on a river, people playing volleyball and of course numerous faces that pop up and then fade away.  they were all very clear.  i am curious as to why i see this kind of imagery sometimes and other times i don't see anything.
