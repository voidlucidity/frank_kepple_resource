I'll try to be brief but not sure if that's possible.  As I mentioned in the introduction section, I've been having some weird experiences since I was 13 years old (I'm 33 now).  I never knew what these were until Sylvia Brown told me it was astral projection.  I have never been able to choose when I have these experiences, but it seems like I get awakened during the night with a weird vibrating sensation and like something is creeping over the covers.
<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago, my little 18 year old brother was in a car accident.  He was in the hospital In a coma and on life support for 9 days.  He didn't survive.  The second day he was in the hospital, I was "awakened" by a feeling of some intense energy hugging me and creeping over me.  I looked over my shoulder and saw my brother.  He joked that this felt weird so I turned around and then seemed to be standing next to him, next to my bed.  I tugged down on my pajama top to try to cover up better.  We just had an amazing embrace.  I told him I was sorry this happened to him.  I was trying to keep my composure to get in as many questions as possible.  I asked if he was coming back(to life) and he kinda smiled like why would I want to do that.  I heard him talking to his guide but couldn't hear his guide myself.  I asked his guides name and mine.  There was more to the conversation, but I suddenly slipped back into my body.
<br>
<br>
I recorded it all in my dream journal.
<br>
<br>
Soon after, I slipped back onto the astral plane.  It was dark at first and I called out but couldn't speak.   I realized all I needed was thought and called him again.  He was there.  We rejoiced at being able to do this.  I slipped away again.  Two days later, I was able to meet with him twice in one night.  It felt so good to hold him.  We touched our hands together and marveled at how it felt like static electricity.  We were so giddy, excited I could actually hear him and that we could be meeting like this.
<br>
<br>
Then I realized I didn't know how long it would last and I started to ask my questions and listen to what he had to tell me.  This was the first time I had no fear during one of these experiences.
<br>
<br>
My questions are:
<br>
<br>
What do you call this type of experience?
<br>
<br>
I've been reading everything I can to try to help this happen again but with no luck.  I haven't been able to since he died?  If he crossed over and isn't on the astral plane any more, can we still meet this way?  Anybody have similar experience?  Did he come to me or did I naturally leave my body and he just knew I could hear him?
<br>
<br>
Any help understanding this would be great .  Thanks!
<br>

Kim:

<br>
First, your experiences are not "weird". What you are doing is very natural. You are consciously shifting your focus of attention to a different area in consciousness than the physical.
<br>
<br>
You ask what this is called. Unfortunately, the answer you get will vary depending on what beliefs the person in question subscribes to. A person who subscribes to mystical belief constructs would perhaps say it was an astral projection. Myself, I prefer to describe the actual actions in consciousness that are taking place.
<br>
<br>
From what you describe, you focused your attention within what is known as the Transition Area. In my Phasing Model of consciousness, this is Focus 3. When someone "dies" they don't actually die, they merely revert to living in the Transition Area in consciousness. This is where your brother will be now. It is still possible to project your focus of attention to this area. Perhaps take a look at Bruce Moen's work as he is a bit of a specialist in this kind of thing. He specialises in teaching people how to make contact with loved one's who have permanently disengaged physical focus, and who are now resident within Focus 3 of consciousness or The Afterlife, as Bruce calls it.
<br>
<br>
He has a fairly simple Focused Attention approach that anyone can do and it's all very straightforward and in plain English. So you don't have to be a mystic or have any special powers or anything. I haven't got his web address to hand, but from memory I think it's
