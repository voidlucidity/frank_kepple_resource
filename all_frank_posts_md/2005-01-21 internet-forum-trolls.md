<br>
Are you a troll?
<br>
<br>
Do you know one?
<br>
<br>
Are you plagued by them?
<br>
<br>
Are they friend or foe!
<br>
<br>
Who invented them?
<br>
<br>
Is there a cure for this condition?
<br>
<br>
How do they spawn?
<br>
<br>
Do you have similar questions?
<br>
<br>
Who knows the answers?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

You can usually tell by the feel of the posts, by their lack of honesty, their extremely selective hearing, slight fluffyness of posts, a general lack of knowledge of the subject matter while not actually being interested in listening and learning, etc. Generally they put on a facade of being high and mighty, usually being very easily offended, but when they lash out it can be done blatently, which is easy for us mods to deal with, or subtely - like shaking someones hand and smiling while, out of sight, kicking them in the shins with spiky steel toe caps on. Tricky to deal with, especially if good forum folks take their side (often just reacting defensively against mods by default, like always taking the side of the "underdog" which as you can image, happens a fair bit here). You get stuck between the best for the forums, and lots of inexperienced/naive net users telling you to stop being so fascist! Which SUCKS allmightily.
<br>
<br>
I've seen quite a few "trolls", and am not sure what the best tactic is - if ignoring them on mass can be done, is best, but it rarely works like that. The best I saw was on these forums, years ago now I gotta say, when trolls got driven away by the overwhelming nice-ness of members, who utterly refused to get annoyed!!! The troll would get more and more aggravated, and members in turn just got nicer, it was an awesome sight!!!
<br>
Adding any angst into the discussion is just what they want, its like they feed off it, and it will only encourage them.
<br>
<br>
Good links!!

<br>
adio...
