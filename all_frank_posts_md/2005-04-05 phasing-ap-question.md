hello all
<br>
i have been trying to accomplish any kind of out of body/phasing experience, with no success.  anyway the question i have is for the people who achieve either one of these, how long on the average do you have to meditate before you achieve the the focus level you need?  for the more experienced travelers (frank, major tom, etc), what is your success rate of having these experiences, IE 1 out of every 5 attempts?
<br>
also, i must thank you all for all the great variety of info that you provide.

Phasing into full astral or RTZ I`m never succesful at. Well, practically never.
<br>
<br>
A deep focus 10 usually sets in after half an hour for me. After that, it depends on all kinds of factors whether I make it to 12. Usually get glimpses of it though.
<br>
<br>
Doesn`t stop me from practicing even though it actually has brought down the frequency of my regular semi-spontaneous OBEs (once a week lately)
<br>
<br>
It`s more like a long term goal for me and it does take a whole lot of practice.
<br>
<br>
Generally, it is possible to boost these type of experiences, but it requires ideal conditions.
<br>
<br>
Like no work, no worry, good mood, pleasant activities during the day, staying grounded, good food, no stress, keeping a dream journal, frequent wake-ups, relentless practice, lots of sleep etc...
<br>
<br>
Other than that, rely on a second wind in your practice...
<br>
<br>
It`s almost a lifestyle..this OBE thing..

Gosh - I could have written that about myself, Major Tom!  Well, not quite so eloquently, but you know what I mean.
<br>
<br>
I would
<u>
 strongly
</u>
recommend a dream journal.  I've found that if I write up my dreams every single day (even though it might seem unnecessary), not only do I dream more, I tend to have more lucid dreams, and I have OBEs in the middle of dreams, which lead to more experiences and so on and so on.
<br>
<br>
Also, as MT put it, eating, living and breathing non-physical reality does tend to help too...

thanks for the reply, i hear you about making it pretty much your lifestyle, if my boss were to find out the amount of time i try and meditate down here in my office he would not be too pleased!  even though i have not been able to achieve either state from meditating yet, i have noticed improvement - my focus is getting better and better.   when it comes to phasing, is energy work important?

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
I don't meditate at all and I'm not actually sure what meditation is. People talk in conventional terms of achieving a "trance state" and I'm not sure what that is either. All I know is the more hurdles you place in your way the more difficult it will be.
<br>
<br>
Phasing pertains to a particular model of consciousness. It does not rely upon achieving any particular focus state relating to the Monroe model. Though there are often similarities in experience, and relating certain of these similarities to particular Monroe focus states such as F10, F12, F21 (i.e. the 3 most useful to beginners) can often be helpful, but it is by no means necessary.
<br>
<br>
My success rate is not something I measure. Phasing to F2 I'd say is 99% provided I can be fairly relaxed and comfortable. So if I were outside in a rainstorm and it was blowing a gale, then I'd have little chance. But lying in bed with no distractions, then chances of F2 are near certain. F3 is about 90% and F4 about 30%. It's not really any harder to phase from F1 to F4 it's just my familiarity with the F4 state is a lot less than the F2 state, because I have been doing it nowhere near as long.
<br>
<br>
I'm assuming you can fall asleep. In which case, next time you arrange to do so, go to bed an hour earlier than you would normally do and, rather than letting your mind just drift off, simply look within yourself and notice what goes on. You don't need to bother about what your physical body is doing, simply focus within yourself and let that take your attention.
<br>
<br>
You need to get your imagination working (this is a most important aspect) and create some kind of mental scene within your mind. Keep noticing it. Notice how the picture builds and becomes more lifelike the more you concentrate on it. Notice how your attention wanders sometimes, notice how the internal landscape changes. Notice how you are noticing yourself in the action of noticing. See yourself on several different "levels" of noticing. Notice how it often feels like there are several of you all noticing each other at once.
<br>
<br>
You need to get your senses involved within you. Notice how you can see things, hear things, touch things, have it all going on inside your imagination while you notice it happening. Then, at some point, your attention will become captured by it. You'll notice changes taking place, people will start talking to you and you will begin conversing back to them. Events will start taking place, they'll take on a life of their own and, for a short while, you will join in. Then, chances are, you will suddenly freak out thinking, hang on a minute, I'm not creating this!
<br>
<br>
You'll feel yourself "return" to the physical and you will be thinking back to a moment ago, when it was like you were in another world, a different realm of reality (because you were!). This is Phasing. It needs no trance, no meditation, no energy work, and no other "body". There is no feeling of separation, no immense fear, no "out of body" sensations, no vibrations, and no other weird feelings at all. All the while you feel like you are the same you, and all that changed is your environment.
<br>
<br>
It's all sparked off through the simple act of noticing together with a huge dollop of imagination as a kick-start. It's not something you sit and wait for, it's something you actively work towards achieving. People who sit around waiting usually a) get bored, or b) fall asleep.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

My Problem usually is that I can not shift my awarness away from my body. I feel uncomfortable and have to move alot if I dont move I still feel my Body I feel how my belly lifts from the breathing etc and I need to swallow from time to time. I guess as long as one can not completly pull the awarness away from the Body phasing is not posssible, correct?
<br>
Any hints appreciated.........

Wow, that's a really helpful post on phasing, Frank! I'd add that to the sticky FAQ about Phasing, because it helped me understand what Phasing is (and how to do it) a whole lot better.

<br>
I think this is very important. Every success that I've had has come from times when I didn't worry or think about what my body was doing. Basically, it was itch if there's an itch, move if uncomfortable, pretty much act the same way you do if you're going to sleep (in which case, unless you have insomnia, you don't usually even think anything about what sensations your body might be having when you go to bed at night).
<br>
<br>
One of the problems with OBE techniques and the like are the talk about floaty feelings, numbness, vibrations, how relaxed you are, so that when you practice you're constantly checking for these body sensations, and if they even start to happen, you get so excited you jump right out of it.
<br>
<br>
Getting involved with an imaginary scene in your mind, getting involved enough to draw all your senses into it, makes so much more sense! That's basically how F10 comes about naturally during the course of the normal day - whether watching a movie, or painting, or listening to music, or writing.

Tombo:
<br>
<br>
Then how do you fall asleep?
<br>
<br>
You don't "pull awareness" away from the body. You just let the physical body get on with what it wants to do. Many times I'll be focused within F2oC and be totally aware of being in the physical. I think people generally have got too latched on to the idea that the physical must be out of the picture completely, first, before any other thing can take place. Then, what happens is they get some physical-body issue come up and they think, drat that's blown it.
<br>
<br>
With me, I'll be noticing within myself and I may get some uncomfortableness to do with my physical, say, my left knee starts itching. So I'll scratch it. But I'll still be noticing what's going on within. You don't have to let your concentration be broken. Okay, perhaps there are elements that are easier said than done.
<br>
<br>
I am particularly sensitive to outside sounds. If I don't have silence then I find it incredibly difficult. But I get around this by wearing earplugs when project during the day. At night, where I live is deathly quiet, so there is no problem for me.
<br>
<br>
But many times I'll have physical issues to deal with. Even going for a pee in the middle of a projection. I can still hold the feeling and project right back into it. I haven't always been able to do that. There was a time I thought, oh heck, that's ruined it... and so it did. But now I'm far more laid back about the whole process.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

...in the beginning there is not so much success but  keep at it
<br>
I had a breakthrough in 1995 when i met Robert Bruce.His energy body development, his trancing ,projecting and meditation techniques amazed me . He demonstrated instant sitting and projecting like drinking a glass of water effortlessly . That was a huge force in my life then .  In 1999 I met Bill Van de Berg , Marlene Watson and Jacky Lindsay they triggered great growth in group situations they taught me how to easily get to f12 but i could not seem to get far alone at all then .  During this stage the streaming became easier though and lucidity and recall were learned and these are hugely important . They taught me projection and breathing techniques too.  With every success predictably you will be able to control how and where you go . In 2002 I met Jodi Bolton and another step forward was made f12s became easy to accomplish alone . Jodi Bill and I started a group together with Andrew Oats in 2002 most of my meditations led me to f12 whether in a group or alone . It was only after we formed a working closed circle that we made the greatest step forward ,  in 2004 we learned to go from f12 to f27 within a meditation as we chose everytime .But still when I worked alone f12 was a border until about sept ??last year . Now I can go from F12 to F 35 as I will alone or in a group . The group can easily go to F35 but we have only reached that F35 this year in Feb and we have only gone there 6 times .I find tapping the universal mind is conversely easier to do alone now . But I feel there is much more work to do on the energy body to allow integration and recall of what is learned . And to go past F35  which is what I am  trying to do now . We are manifesting a third type of alchemical sphinx . I met a peer here online and together we are intuiting the method to manifest  a new merkaba .

I loved your reply Frank.  The way you described the scene going on in the mind was great.  That's the exact same thing I do.  Just let your self get deeper and deeper.  See and sense everything and after a while, the mind will take care of all the work for you.  You just give it a push and it'll roll by itself.

frank, i have read your posts on phasing in the past, but your explanation on this thread has answered many of my questions.  i know i have read here somewhere in the past that you were working on a book, i look forward to it.   i do have another question, it has to do with intent.  i have read here that you need to have intent to phase, how important is this?  and is just wanting to experience phasing enough intent?

That's good news for me. How do I fall asleep? good question, I usually toss and turn for quite awhile (30-60 minutes) before I somehow loss consciousness. I usually go pee during the night, after that I fall asleep faster. I had  severe insomnia a couple of years ago, therefore I have a hard time falling asleep although the insomnia is much better now.
<br>
<br>
So if I understand you right it is not crucial to be completely relaxed and unaware of the body but just not hold the main focus of attention within oneself, so to speak?
<br>
<br>
There is an other question in my mind: You say we should try to phase in the evening. I always thought it won't work at that time cause the REM -sleep is far away. So, you say it doesn't matter. I would figure, I could try to phase when I go back to bed in the middle of the night as well then.
<br>
Would you say that is a option as well?

<section>
After reading Frank's post on this a little light-bulb went off in my head. Last night before going to sleep I tried doing as Frank suggests (which is really simple to do).
<br>
<br>
I created a mental picture in my mind that I enjoy. I got the idea from API, but it's my own personal island. Last night I switched through a few different scenarios until I decided on the island, because the imagery was the most engaging.
<br>
<br>
Last night I decided to go into the little office under the island. It goes down onto an open patio with beach umbrellas, into an office area with walls made out of old corral, and then down a little way to a huge glass window that you can sit on the sill and see out onto a corral reef from under the water.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, so I focused my senses on this scene, just sitting there looking out through the glass, and imagining what I would see. At times I would think I could feel the cool temperature of the glass, smell the ocean air (which is interesting, since I've never been to an ocean in my life). I relaxed more and more, forgetting pretty much about anything to do with falling asleep. As I did so, clear images started appearing on their own. It's hard to explain, but these new images didn't seem to come from my mental screen, but like from a different screen overlaid onto it. I would suddenly see corral formations and tropical fish quite clearly that I wasn't imagining (or evoking consciously, anyway). They started to get more intense, more frequent, instead of glimpses lasting for a while. I could see even the moonlight through the ripples of the waves above undulating over the fish scales, how there were like the shadows that move over the ground on a cloudy day that moved through the reef.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I noticed - near this point I began to feel a weird sensation. The only way I can describe it is a feeling of dislocation, or like my sense of balance was doing something way out of whack. Maybe I'll be able to describe it more clearly later.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I lost consciousness after that. Still, it was a very pleasant experience. I can't wait to explore it more.

mactombs,
<br>
sounds like you are on the threshhold, like all you have to do now is phase into that scene - this is from what i have read.  if you dont mind, could you keep us informed with your progress, its always informative and encouraging hearing success stories and how they were achieved.  thanks and good luck

<section>
After getting back on track yesterday (which I posted about in the "I'm getting nowhere" thread) I put my new understanding of Phasing to use.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday's session is the furthest I've managed to go with consciously "getting out"! It was fantastic.
<br>
<br>
I started off by just relaxing, laying on my back, letting myself get comfortable, letting my mind wander. I put on the headphones and listened to the Monroe Institutes's "Transcendence" CD. After a little bit, I felt sufficiently relaxed and started proper. I began by imagining a room with a box. I put all the thoughts running around in my head from the day, work issues, etc., and my inner dialog into the box and locked it up to reclaim after the session was over.
<br>
<br>
Next, I imagined myself in my locale. At first, my mind didn't want to stay steady in one location. Things out of place would pop up, or I'd be reminded of other things. Finally, I settled into my tropical island. I engaged my senses into the scenes of the locale, trying to remember not to get over-involved with creating it all, but just enough to remain fixed in it.
<br>
<br>
Naturally, I kept wanting to check on the status of my body, but tried to keep that to a minimum (I'm sure it'll get better with practice). I also had some inner dialog, but I did pretty well at keeping that to a minimum, too. After a while, I began to feel much more relaxed than I've ever before in those instances when my mind went back to my body. I felt almost paralyzed ... and my arms felt like they were drifting above my body. I tried not to get caught up in this, but to keep engaged in the island.
<br>
<br>
At one point, I drifted off for a few moments. When I came to, I wasn't sure where I was. I still had the island imagery running. Then, I thought I'd spontaneously opened my eyes. I realized soon, however, that I was seeing
<i>
 through
</i>
my eyelids!
<br>
<br>
To get back on track, I tried to become passive of these effects and keep focused on the island once again. This works very well. Soon I began to have a really strange feeling like I was in two places at the same time. I got pretty confused at this. I started feeling nervous about the weird sensations I was feeling (plus that kind of paranoid sense that I wasn't alone). By this time, I'd been laying there for about 1.5 hours. I decided to end the session there.
<br>
<br>
After this experience, I have to say, this Phasing approach is so much simpler and easier for me to comprehend than anything I've tried before. It makes me feel confident about success in the near future, and confident for repeatable success.
<br>
<br>
Again, thanks to Frank for his great posts on Phasing. I'm kinda dense on how to do this, but there's enough clear content in his posts to have been invaluable for helping me along.

</i>
<br>
<br>
Right, you got it. Like I've said it is a
<u>
 very
</u>
tricky mental balancing act. Get too involved and it doesn't work, get not too involved and you fall asleep, or if you are not tired, you get bored.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "Naturally, I kept wanting to check on the status of my body, but tried to keep that to a minimum (I'm sure it'll get better with practice)."
</i>
<br>
<br>
You said it, yep, you keep wanting to check but that keeps you out of falling into it. You've got to just forget the physical. Yes, it does come with practice.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "I also had some inner dialog, but I did pretty well at keeping that to a minimum, too."
</i>
<br>
<br>
Yep, inner dialogue that too can be distracting but the key is to keep your focus on whatever it is. It's not easy, I agree. But if you try too hard to keep your focus, you will lose it. Now, when this happens to someone they tend to "fight" to get it back. But the more they try, the more they lose it. So that is what I mean when you should not-try. It's like, your focus has gone away from you because you have tried too hard to grasp it. The more you try grasping for it, the more it runs away from you. So you have to take a big step back and let come back to you again.
<br>

Great, whatever happens to your physical, don't get caught up in it, just

 keep your focus

 At one point, I drifted off for a few moments. When I came to, I wasn't sure where I was. I still had the island imagery running. Then, I thought I'd spontaneously opened my eyes. I realized soon, however, that I was seeing through my eyelids!"

Ha ha ha, this is a typical overlay experience. From what you say it was an F2/F1 overlay. In that you were primarily focused within F2 which was your Island Imagery and then you suddenly realised you could see through your closed eyes, which is F1 (physical).
<br>
<br>

 "To get back on track, I tried to become passive of these effects and keep focused on the island once again. This works very well. Soon I began to have a really strange feeling like I was in two places at the same time."
</i>
<br>
<br>
Okay, that's good, keep your primary focus. The fact that you keep losing it for moments here and there is normal at first (I still do it sometimes even now!). Two places at the same time, again, this is a typical overlay experience.
<br>
<br>

 " I got pretty confused at this. I started feeling nervous about the weird sensations I was feeling (plus that kind of paranoid sense that I wasn't alone). By this time, I'd been laying there for about 1.5 hours. I decided to end the session there."

<br>
<br>
Yep, as I said just yesterday on another thread, or was it the day before? Anyway, as I said, overlay experiences are perhaps the MOST confusing for beginners. In the physical we are SO used to being in just ONE place at once. But once you step outside physical reality, so to speak, that's when the fun starts! LOL. The feeling that you are in "two places at once" the fact that you feel there is "someone in the room with you" these are very natural overlay experiences.
<br>
<br>
There is no one actually in the room with you. It's just that you are perceiving two or more areas of consciousness
<u>
 at the same time

. This is VERY NORMAL. But yes, at first it IS very freaky, lol.
<br>
<br>
Well done for holding in there. It can't have been easy for you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Thanks for your replies, Frank!

The more I practice Phasing, the more I like it. It really does feel like it's not technique, but basically setting aside your physical baggage for a while, and turning your focus elsewhere. I've been able to repeat the success I had with the previous session, and that really makes me feel enthusiastic. No waiting for vibrations, no worrying about what phase the moon is, how relaxed my body is, etc. So simple!
<br>
<br>
I can't wait until I can get deeper into F2oC! I'll post my results here when I do.

The replies that you've posted have been very useful to me in that they make me feel more confident about working with the method you described. I've tried many techniques but I definitely think I will have more success with "phasing" if I just relax in my bed before Sleeping and don't make as huge a deal out of it.
<br>
<br>
Creating a setting and engaging it enough to keep the mind from getting bored sounds great, and I know its something I can do because I realised its something I tend to do anyway before I fall asleep (without even realising it). I'll try it over the next few nights and post my results.

Thanks for sharing your experiences here. They too have been very inspiring. Its nice to know I'm not the only person that finds some of the many methods available out there somewhat difficult to comprehend. This method certainly does sound simpler. Though I still understand that like anything else, it will take practice, its always best to work with the techniques that you are the  *most* comfortable with.
