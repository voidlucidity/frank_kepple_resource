If I set the time and date on my computer to some time in 2004 or 2005 will that cause my post to be listed as the first post of that year?

That would be cheating, I know, but actually I suspect that the time and date are not provided on our individual computers. It would be necessary so that we can all post from different time zones and have our posts go in the right order.

Happy New Year everyone!  My new year's resolution is to flatten my stomach to the point where I can fit into those low-cut teenybopper jeans without looking like Anna Nicole Smith.  (Isn't that pathetically shallow?)
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wish everyone a BLESSED YEAR, with magical, stress-free OBE's for everyone!  May we all meet on the Astral someday . . .
