<section>
for me (i may have a natural ability at this) i use a combination of sleep deprivation, caffiene, and attention to details.....to eloborate, i try to only get around 2 hours of sleep a few times a day so that i don't go into "deep sleep"....the caffiene (besides helping me stay awake) keeps my mind very awake while my physical body is very tired.....as i go to sleep i just watch the closed eyes view....blackness,  colors, tunnel,  etc. then can kindof "feel" the moment i fall asleep (usually only about 2 minutes at most for me) then i just "get up" basically..... no "exit symptoms either"....i am then in the "realtime zone" and usually stay there for a few minutes then enter into a lucid dream (i guess i could enter elsewhere, but i personally enjoy the lucid dreaming aspect)  i have been doing this off and on for many years....

ss_majin_gohan,
<br>
Well you are certainly in the right place! There are many people
<br>
here who project, and many who soon will,..but I have to ask WHAT ON EARTH [or any plane] are you thinking with this post?? I don't think anyone can sum up in a paragraph what Robert Bruce diligently describes in his book "Astral Dynamics" or his "Treatise on OBE" (conveniently located on THIS SITE) with any more "EXTREME DETAIL."
<br>
Have you read either of those? If not, I would urge you to start there and ask questions as necessary. It worked for me, sadly there is no brief explanation that could even begin to cover what you would learn by reading the afore mentioned texts.
<br>
take care, and good luck.
<br>
Wonderboy

I tried a technique last night which involved focusing on my 3rd eye, or brow just above my eyes. This gave me some interesting exit sensations relativly quickly, after around 20 minutes.

I'm not sure what you mean in your footnote by, "take all your shame to the grave" and so forth. I've always said that people who think death is the end, are in for a big surprise.

<br>
On the subject of Astral projection: if you are looking for a relatively easy way to make a start, the Bruce Moen Focussed Attention method could well be a consideration. This method is about as simple as it gets while managing to yield meaningful results.
<br>
<br>
Beyond that it all starts to get a little tricky. So if you are like most of us here, in that you were not born with any particular talent for this kind of thing, then expect to have to practice for quite a while in order to develop and hone the necessary skills.
<br>
<br>

Well, I don't read books very often, and I am could NOT bring a book like that in my house! My Mom is VERY against that kinda thing! Anyways, I am not asking about Bruce's books or methods, I am asking about YOU GUYS' methods!

Look at all the posts on these boards.  Almost everyone is looking how to project or how to project more often. Most people use the methods in the book or variations of those methods.  You really should read the book.  OBE really is a skill and like any skill it can take time unless your a natural.

Hey, I just projected last night, it only lasted a few mins, but that is besides the point! The point is, I got it on the first try! i also wanted to know, how do you get to the Astral Plains anyways?

Since your asking about my method, my method is... no method. [

<br>
<br>
To OBE, just do like you're going to sleep. Only you retain awareness. You don't sleep all the way.  So, just sleep, you don't need to relax, nothing need to be done. Anything else is overcomplication.
<br>
<br>
Actually I just bounce the asleep/awake line while looking at the calming blackness behind my clodes eyelids.
<br>
<br>
That's it.
<br>

If you got it your first try, why do you need extreme help?  A lot of people aren't able to project even after practicing a long time.  Its not like we can tell you in several sentence how to reach a higher level.  If you can't have Astral Dynamics in your house then check out

I think I do this inadvertently.  I think I have been doing this most of my life-maybe we all do and just dont remember.  Anyway-I sometimes know I am doing it because I will see something I know is not possible or see or tt someone I know is dead, it is like it makes me conscious or aware that I am asleep.  It is generally very cool-I get some premonition stuff and some really cool experiances like being able to fly at will-but I also get sleep paralysis upon waking up frequently and often feel like I havent slept at all-drained! I suggest before going to bed-lay very still and concentrate on your body-breath-sounds-sometimes I will feel a vibration that begins at my feet and goes up and than I will feel like I am floating-sometimes you will hear a buzzing sound-try to stay conscious-the rest is up to you. Maybe you can decide on a signal for yourself-so you will know when you are asleep-I heard this works for alot of people-I never really did that-but as I said earlier-like sometimes I will see someone I know is dead and they are talking to me and it will snap me conscious that I must be dreaming! Also-I am curious to know if other people get sleep paralysis-is this a part of astral projection-lucid dreaming?  What do you do about it?[?]

hate to post AGAIN but i went back and read the rest of the form and i think i might be astral projecting without knowing it help me out here. a few weeks ago around the time when my friend and i first started, you know the ki mind body spirit thing i had a "dream" that i could levitate anything i wanted. which made me wake up drainded. that was around 2:30am. i went back to sleep and had the SAME EXACT dream!!! when i awoke this time it was to the sound of a  lamp smashing to my floor.....the same one i levitated in my dream! does that have anything to do with astral projecting???-Jake
