Hello,
<br>
<br>
I found this place through another BB (Crimson Circle) quite fortuitously it seems!  I've had lots of astral expereinces I don't even know where to begin!  SO I will just say hello and get to know the place here.
<br>
<br>
I'm definitely interested in always learning and expereincing, especially since I'm making the foray into doing intuitive work for a living, and it seems like there's lots to learn here.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to those who built this site!
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
<br>
Ali
