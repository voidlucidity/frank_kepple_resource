Have you looked into the LBRP at all?

I've heard that it is very effective for removing unwanted influences.

Why do you think it is negative forces? there are a lot of weird things-such as voices, hands grabbing you, visual hallucinations- that could happen in the transitional state while going out- RB says these are 'normal' and not to notice them. If you put too much fear in the process you could create it yourself.
<br>
What kind of odd things have happened?

Outside influences do not have to be negative to be unwanted. They can be especially unwanted when they are negative, though. Either way, it can help to clear the energy of random, unwanted influences and to bring in positive energies.

If you believe in God, spirits, angels, or other kinds of protective entities, I highly recommend calling on them.
<br>
<br>
Take a bath before you attempt to meditate or OBE.  Imagine all unwanted energy goes down the drain when you empty the tub.
<br>
<br>
Learning how to "shield" also is useful.  Imagine yourself surrounded by a protective force.  Practice this a lot so that you can FEEL it.
<br>
<br>
Work on your fears in the day-to-day, whether it be of spiders, abandonment, heights, whatever.  This is SOOOO important.  A spiritual warrior needs to be fearless.  Not stupidly mindless, but fearless.  There is a difference!
<br>
<br>
Lastly . . . go slow.  You have your whole life to work on this!
<br>

Hello....Some entitie whether dark or neutral are draw by energy (parasitic spiriits). They are drawn by fear as well as negitive emotion. The more you fear the more prevelent they become. Involve your self in possitive aformations before sleep and call on your higher self to over come the fear. Think of your self protected by a shield of white light outwardly surounded with mirrors , negitivity reflects back to it's originator. I find sending all white light and love works in theory but if the force you encounter is incapible of love your efforts in this method are friutless for the entity is more proned to otain energy thought fear than something it dosen't relate to. The last resort being visualization is everything is before you sleep envision your self going to acompletly diferent place , in the company of guides you know and trust

I find humour quite useful, have you tried having a good laugh every couple of hours, or so? Works wonders for me.

That reminds me of a taoist yogic practice called the inner smile. It is also a way of cultivating energy. It is very powerful but it is not easy to do at first. I don't smile much. A smile is caused to begin in the eyes, such as by thinking about positive memories. Then the smile is caused slowly at first to spread, such as into the lips and forehead. When it is in a small area it is spread slowly. Then it can be caused to move rapidly. A comparison is with starting a fire. At first it is necessary to go slowly, but as the fire gets bigger it can be used to spread larger fires. There are patterns through which the energy can be sent and as it is a taoist practice the energy is directed into specific organs. Unfortunately this exercise is hardest for people who need it most.
