You cannot suffer any direct physical harm if that's what you mean. But what you are proposing is to enter realms of existance where you can come across all manner of what you might call nasty scenarios. This can affect a person mentally I suppose. Ultimately, it all depends on the individual.
<br>
<br>
Normally when people project for the first time they get scared out of their wits. But they get used to it after a while. The lower planes are populated by all manner of human crud, which beginners can get bogged down by. There was a post just recently by a person who was sensing a little bleed-through from the lower planes and they immediately started dwelling on it. Which is typical. Problem is, what people in this position don't tend to realise is just about everything on the lower planes has got something to do with blood guts and gore to varying degrees. Well, it's either that or sex. But the key is just to close your eyes to it all, and you very soon learn to pass through without a blip.
<br>
<br>
The more saner non-physical environments are populated by people of all types just like the physical. People whom you can chat with if you want, well, those that are open to you that is. Plus, you can basically go wherever you like. There are no
<i>
 limits
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Constructs such as exterior "limitations" are physical-realm only. Any limitations that go on in the non-physical will have you as the source.

It is not dangerous. Sometimes you can come across a "negative" but don't worry about that. You enter different frequencys that are ALOT less dense the the physical existance. You can meet your guides, take a look at your past life through the akashic records, or just fly around and do whatever!(avoid sex)[

I thank Frank who posted above and others here and elsewhere for their valued experience, it helped me take the plunge into obe. Great advice to be had here
<br>
<br>
But as a reletive novice I'll add my 2 penny's worth....I can say that so far my obe experiences have been pleasant. I also had some misgivings before I started to try obe. I had several spontaneous one's as a kid which were a bit scary but at the time I didn't know what was happening or what they were....but since I've been having controlled ones everything has been fine. The vibrations startled me a bit to begin with but now I welcome them and they seem more of a comforting thing than anything
<br>
<br>
I've not come across anything negative yet and as others say, you can't really be harmed by them anyway.....have a mindset that's positive and curious and it should be alright. That's how I do it and so far so good [

<br>
<br>
But hey, I'm a rank beginner, so I'm not really qualified to quell your fears. Just thought I'd post as an example of someone new to it and it aint killed me yet [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]....on the contrary, it's been a wonderful uplifting experience[
