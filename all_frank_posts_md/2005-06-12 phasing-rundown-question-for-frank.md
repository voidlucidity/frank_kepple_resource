<section>
I have a question in regards to phasing. I have read several posts attempting to avoid having to ask this question but am still confused. My confusion is regarding the rundown often mentioned. I have became very good at getting hypnagogic images almost at will when relaxing. I will get faces and buildings and all manner of white cloudy images pass my field of vision. This ability through practice is something I feel I really have developed over the past few years. I continue to have trouble transitioning from F1oC to full F2oC however as I simply fall asleep watching these images or will feel like I am floating then be jolted to F1oC.
<br>
<br>
Should I be attempting to do the mental rundown with the hypnagogic images? I have trouble latching onto these images as they are fleeting in nature. This being the case do I just need more practice? Is this where my rundown should be taking place? I know the rundown is an attempt to feel, smell, taste and become part of the scene.
<br>
<br>
Do I want to forget the images being created randomly or play an active role in creating them? If this is the case I was thinking about riding a horse due to he bouncing motion and the smell of the air and taste of the wind.
<br>
<br>
If this is the case where the rundown takes place during the transition from F1oC to a full F2oC does the rundown stop at once when F2oC is achieved? should I then attempt to go toward the 3D blackness to F3oC?
<br>
<br>
Only a few times in the past have I felt I fully phased from F1oC to F2oC and it was almost unintentional as I was completely exhausted I upon falling asleep and watching the images found myself full aware in F2oC.
<br>
<br>
My last question is a doosy as I have made it to F3oC a few times and every time there seems to be someone there who attempts to make contact with me. It is as if there is a bell that rings when I arrive and someone comes to greet me. The first time this happened I ran from a man and women who said they wanted to talk to me. Another time I was semi lucid in what I know now was borderline F2 and f3. He told me to snap out of it, other words to become conscious. After I did he told me " there is something you have been wanting me to show you for awhile" I followed him and showed me a group a children at which time I became scared and was jolted awake.
<br>
<br>
In anyone's opinion who are these people? I can state that I do not believe these people to be thought forms as they behaved as anyone in the physical.  After I ran from the man and women I seemed to have created a thought form.  The character of this person was different.  He did not move or speak and upon close observation seems to be made of fish hooks.  Not a pleasent sight at all. I want to start conversing in the future. Thanks.
<br>
Yours Lee.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Haven't been on the forum for the past couple of days as I've been a tad pushed for time trying to organise my new Virtual Classroom and a few other ordinary-life bits and bobs. I just copied your post into my "to answer" file and I'll get back to you in a day or two. In the meantime if anyone else has any ideas then please feel free to respond.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You are concentrating too much on these fleeting images, IMO, so it is causing you to lose your mental focus. Normally, as we fall asleep our mental focus dissipates and we go off to dreamland. I feel that by you paying attention to these images, you are helping yourself fall asleep more than anything. The images are too fleeting in nature to make sense of usually. I once tried but gave up as they are just too nonsensical and I was spending study-time on a phenomenon that wasn't bringing me any benefits.
<br>
<br>
I think you have 2 choices of approach...
<br>
<br>
1) You can try to hold your mental focus by attempting to think through, or think beyond the random imagery. Try to pitch your focus somewhere in the distance "behind" the imagery. I say this because the imagery tends to be right in your face, as it were. All manner of this and that in the foreground. So try to think through it all and pitch your focus of attention into the background of the image scene and try to keep your focus concentrated there as your physical body falls asleep. If you can hold this, it wouldn't surprise me if you were to suddenly find yourself in Fz.
<br>
<br>
2) You can simply ignore the imagery and create a basic rundown for yourself and concentrate on that. Riding a horse is a good one. Walking is not too engaging, I find, but a nice rising-trot is ideal. With me I tend to limit myself to a schooling situation rather than hacking out. That way I can do a few full circuits; change across the diagonal and onto the other leg then a few circles and figures of eight, that kind of thing. Works rather well for me I find.
<br>
<br>
As regards the people you are seeing, you have to begin to accept that when you shift to Focus 3 you WILL come across all manner of other people. These people are not "figments of your imagination" they are actually other people engaged within Transition. One of the freakiest things that would happen to me is people would greet me like a close friend and I simply would not have a clue who they were. But all of us have what I call a non-physical family. These are people that know us and we tend to gravitate towards them for all manner of reasons.
<br>
<br>
In time you will learn to overcome your fears and simply get used to meeting and greeting these people. The simplest way to find out who they are is to stick around long enough to ask. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

This worked really well for me. Since I get the random imagery very easily and usually am nearly fully conscious when I do, this seemed the easiest approach for me. It was easier to do than I thought it would be; I thought it would be hard since that random imagery is really good at starting me dreaming, and I didn't know how or where to pitch my focus in the background. But I did.
<br>
<br>
The small problem is, being aware while passively watching these random images for about 30 minutes, nothing happened (I'm fairly certain I was even physically asleep the whole time). So I got up for work.
<br>
<br>
I need to experiment more. But why do these images just keep going? I'm finding stepping into anything else elusive.

Maybe your intent is the problem? Half of getting there is wanting to get there, so are you sure you have a clear plan? Maybe next time you are watching these images focus on a place you would like to end up in.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Think of your mental focus of attention as a dynamic entity. A point of awareness that revels in sensation. While physical, your physical circumstances are a hive of sensation. All those emotions, thoughts and feelings are what your mental focus of attention revels in. It's why you became physical, to revel in all these physical sensations. Your mental focus of attention becomes attracted to the physical body like a powerful magnet. This is what makes the physical our Primary Focus.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so somehow you have to seduce this point of awareness away from the physical into another area of your conscious continuum. How are you going to do that?
<br>
<br>
You have to entice it with an alternative set of sensationalist criteria.
<br>
<br>
Now, if you are laying back with very little input from the physical... but... you have this rather exciting random imagery all going in right in front of your face, as it were. Your mental focus of attention is going to really revel in that instead. Lot's of "scary" imagery, wow, look at all this coming and going, yeah, this is great let's revel in it. So it captures your attention and, before you know it that is all you are doing.
<br>
<br>
These effects, such as the random imagery we see at the Focus 12 state (in Monroe terms) are to be used like road signs that give us an indication of forwards progress. Stopping to look is like driving down the freeway, seeing your exit sign in one mile but, instead of carrying on, you stop and look at the sign and keep on reading it. Once you do that, all forward progress is stopped. Some of these signs can be really interesting. But the moment you stop to look then all forwards progress is halted. This is why I say that in your perception, you should attempt to look "beyond" the signs, not concentrate on the signs themselves. Try to pitch your awareness behind all the imagery and make a progressing through it, and this touches on what Ben has just said also about Intent. Because Intent is a strong driving force that keeps you progressing.
<br>
<br>
When I see this random imagery at Focus 12, my whole mindset is geared towards a forwards progression. With the result, the imagery is a stage that I "pass through".
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That's for all the input; this has answered my question and should help me greatly.  I will begin to attempt the approach of going beyond the images to what lies beyond and this makes sense.  Sometimes the answer is right in front of your eyes LOL and you can not see it.  One day we will all look back and say "Yes I see it so clearly now".  I know the transition to F2oC for me in the past has felt like stepping into a scene beyond the hypnagogic shapes.
<br>
<br>
Thanks yours.
