Hi everyone.
<br>
I've been into astral projection for just over a month, and i think i'm on the way because i remember loads more dreams than i ever did.
<br>
<br>
In the middle of A2 exams at the mo which sucks (gonna have 2 chemistry exams on my birthday, its just not fair).  But then after the 28th i'm finished with school forever, and with the summer holidays starting i'll have lots of time to focus on meditation and stuff, so hopefully in the not too distant future i'll have some kind of wierd trance experience to share.
<br>
<br>
This is my MSN space for anyone who might want to use up a bit of their time

<br>
<br>
I wonder if theres anyone here hoping to start at Sheffield university in September?
<br>
<br>
Anyway, so why do i want to astral project?  I guess there are a few reasons, one of them being that after doing philosophy in school I definitely don't believe in life after death, that course has definitely messed with my head, but in a good way i think.  So in that respect astral projection would be the sort of experience which would stop me being terrified by the prospect of death lol.
<br>
<br>
Good luck to everyone else who is beginning this process
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, for anyone who may be interested I am going to keep a timeline of my progress working towards astral projection, and if there is interest (as there seems to be as several members have asked others how long it can take to project) i will post it when i (hopefully) fully astral project.

Hi Mikael
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your introduction.
<br>
<br>
Keep writing up your dreams - even if some of them seem nonsensical.
<br>
<br>
I lived in Sheffield for a time a few years ago.  As cities go, it's not such a bad place.  You should have a lot of fun there.
<br>
<br>
Good luck with the exams - and with astral projection of course!

Hello Mikael! Afraid of dying? Quite a few folks are. Sunday school at 4 years old did a number on me. Real fire and brimstone preacher. The other kids were poking each other and chewing their crayons and I was like

<br>
<br>
If a few decades existence here and dying lends any comfort, been there, done that. It was fantastic!!! It's the getting there that's a drag. I've come to believe 100% no one has a soul. We are all souls just temporarily residing in these bodies. When the beat up old Ford I ride around in finally craps out for good, I'll just get out and walk away. Meantime, there's AP.
<br>
<br>
You might check out some of the NDE pages out there. One guy was in a morgue. Been dead 3 days. If I remember the story right, they were about to embalm him or something and he came back as they were making the initial incision. Good luck with AP.
