Let's just assume for now that the astral is real and it is occupied by guides that want to interact with us on the living plane. If you communicate with one why trust them? Why assume that just because you are really in contact with a being from the astral realm that they have any of our best interests in mind? Even if you are receiving some verifiable information how far do you trust them with the rest?

Only experience gives you the ability to tell what's what. (Just as on the Physical plane). After a while you get to recognise there are different types of people who exist in different regions. There is no one particular region solely occupied by guides who want to help us. Guides come from all manner of places.
<br>
<br>
Also, they know all about the person they are attempting to interact with. So they tend to approach you in a manner suitable to you. With me, for example, Harath first began to stimulate my curiosity. Then he gave me the distinct impression someone was following me around and generally looking after my interests.
<br>
<br>
Matters came to a head (as he knew they would) and one morning I just said something like, "Look, I know you've been following me around for a while now. So let's cut all this nonsense and just make yourself known." Which he did (as, again, he knew he eventually would).
<br>
<br>
As I say, you get to know the various types of people. Within the lower regions you'll find live all manner of people in an incredibly wide variety of circumstances. All for one reason or another.
<br>
<br>
Many of these people you will find are open to you. By that I mean you can chat with them to various extents. Lot's you will find are pre-occupied with their current situation to the extent where they cannot talk about anything else. These people are in a situation where they are gradually working through that obsession in order to, "get it out of their system" so to speak.
<br>
<br>
More often than not, these people will simply assume your arrival is somehow wrapped-up with their own circumstances. An example I now and again come across is where people die, Physically, thinking that is that. However, like I always say, people who firmly believe that when you die that's it, nothing more, are in for a mighty big surprise!
<br>
<br>
What tends to happen is, people often find themselves within some region or other realising they have died and immediately think, "Oh sh*t, there is an afterlife after all." Then they start feeling guilty about the "bad" things they did while Physical and expect someone is going to turn up any minute, and pass judgement as to whether they go to hell or not. As you turn up, immediately they go to pieces blubbing about all the bad things they did and how sorry they are.
<br>
<br>
Plus, there are all the other types: some of who you might think are a little scary, and others you might find humerous. Like the chap I came across once who actually thought he was Jesus. He even had a queue of people waiting to be "blessed" and so forth.
<br>
<br>
As you move through these areas, you find things start to change for the better. People who live within the upper regions have lived through a number of lifetimes and know what's what. They are friendly and open to you. Plus, they can think independently of their circumstances, as opposed to people in the lower regions whose thoughts very much tend to revolve around their circumstances.
<br>
<br>
These upper regions are where guides generally come from. You ask how you can "trust" them. Well, fortunately, "trust" is a Physical-realm notion only. Within the upper regions there is no such thing as "trust" as there can be no deception. Likewise there is no such thing as "good" or "bad" and notions like that: these are all Physical-realm notions only.
<br>
<br>
What exists is a kind of pleasant continuity. It's a tricky one to explain, but imagine a place where where each person's actions revolve around every other person's actions without any conflict. To a large extent this phenomenon is connected to the fact that people here communicate mind-to-mind. Hence there is never any misunderstanding; no difference of opinion; no complaining; no-one telling anyone else what to do, and such like.
<br>
<br>
Within these regions there is a particular kind of upbeat atmosphere that every one "breathes". It's quite addictive to the extent where often I genuinely prefer to remain where I am, rather than coming back to Physical.

Thanks for your reply, Frank. Would you say then that in any non physical realm that emotions and intensions are so bare and readable that "trust" isn't even an issue?

I havent had an AP yet. But I believe that since these events are as natural as our physical existance, you have to judge people and guides in the astral the same way one judge people and their intentions in the physical. I personally believe that when a person is very pushy about their views then they are not to be trusted fully, if at all. When I meet a guide, I will apply the same judgement on them. Common sence rules in the physical and in the astral, I think.
<br>
<br>
I personally do not believe in using the term "supernatural" with respect to all the experiences discussed in this website. I do not believe that they are "special". I believe that going astral or OBE are just un unexplored side of our nature. Perhaps a lost or dormant ability in all of us. And therefore, All that is encountered in them should be treated the same way as we already do in the physical. Common sense and good intentions will get you far in all planes of existance. Just like there are good and bad people in the physical, so are there in the other planes of reality. Its up to each of us to judge for ourselves who is nauhgty and who is nice. Just my opinion.

Not in "any" non-physical realm. But in the upper regions it's a wholly different ball-game.
<br>
<br>
I see where you are coming from, but it's not a question of people being able to read other people's emotions. As I say, it is tricky for me to explain, but it's like there is only
<u>
 one
</u>
emotion which everyone shares to the same extent.
<br>
<br>
So you have this rather weird situation where people are going about their individual lives, yet there is no argumentation, no upset, and stuff like that.
<br>
<br>
There is no "lack" of anything, for example. Within these realms natural resources are unlimited and free to all. There is no government, no currency, there is no lack of any kind. No-one is struggling while someone else has it easy: each has it "easy" to the same extent.
<br>
<br>
Every individual is somehow connected to an unlimited resource. So no-one can take anything away from another. So there is no such thing as "theft" of any kind. Each individual is free to create whatever it is they desire.
<br>
<br>
Naturally, such a statement begs the question of what if someone wished to create something detrimental to the environment as a whole? It simply couldn't happen.
<br>
<br>
Reason being, as I say above, these people share this "emotion in common" which naturally prevents them from ever wanting to do such a thing.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I suppose we need practice to be able to recognize whether we are on the "upper regions," or the "lower" ones.  But there's a lot you can do in your waking life to increase your good fortune in this regard.
<br>
<br>
On the astral, like-attracts-like.  So it behooves us to work on our own natures!  If we work on our spirituality during the day-to-day, the odds of finding ourselves in a better place on the Astral are SO much improved.
<br>
<br>
Also, the more psychically "clean" you are, the better you can "see," and the better your bullsh*t-detectors get. So if you encounter a yucky being in a bad Astral neighborhood, you will have the wherewithall to either avoid it or otherwise end the enounter.
<br>
<br>
Frank is right - - - he calls it "upper" Astral for convenience - - - but it's really not higher, just closer to the Source.  The closer to the One you get, the more you recognize your One-ness with everyone else. It all makes sense, perfect sense! Wooooooo!
<br>

I know this is just slightly off-topic, but comments I have been hearing have me just a bit confused. What's the difference between Astral Projection and OBE? I have been using the terms interchangably but I'm getting a hint they may differ???
