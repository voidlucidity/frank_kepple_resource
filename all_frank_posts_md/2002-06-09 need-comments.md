<section>
Hi everyone,
<br>
I need comments from the ones who are able to have OBEs. I had the most beautiful experience the other night but I do not know if it was an OBE. I wish it was. I've been trying to have OBEs for months without success.
<br>
Does this look like an OBE to you?
<br>
<br>
I remember everything but feel like I had no real control over my thoughts and my behavior even though I would consciously have done the same thing.
<br>
<br>
The other night, I dreamt that I was suddenly flying and I thought "Wow!!! I am having my first OBE!" but I did not know that I was sleeping.
<br>
The feelings were incredible. I felt I was moving as if I were in gelatine. This is the term that came to my mind during this experience. I then thought I would look at my physical body to make sure I was out of it but I was already far away from it. I said "I want to see" and I could see. I entered a huge building and I would practice flying to go up the stairs.
<br>
<br>
In a room, I expressed the will to meet my guide. Someone showed me a young man made of shade, with one hand in his pocket and the head placed in a no-esteem way (leaning forward as if very shy) . He was moving according to my moves. I would go left, he would go right, etc. I thought "this is not my guide, this is my shade". But I am a woman?!?!
<br>
<br>
Then a woman arrived. She had short red hair and was wearing a tunique. I was very touched to meet my guide. I asked her if she would be there when I need help and she said "yes, espacially at the end". I asked her name and she said "this is a nice question but I can't tell you". I left her unable to stop crying as I was so touched.
<br>
<br>
I met a journalist from Montreal who seemed kind of sleepy and I told him "I'm a friend of Guy A. Lepage (a friend TV star), remember that we met here. Remember!"
<br>
<br>
I went down in a basement and met some "zombies". I repeated 2 times "I do not want to see monsters" and they disappeared.
<br>
<br>
And when I woke up, I was disappointed not to have felt my etheric body reintegrating my physical because now I could not know if this was all a dream or for real. I could remember everything and I was still feeling the joy of the experience and felt as if I had practiced all I had learned about OBE. It was fantastic.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your comments.
<br>

if the experience has a positive meaning for you i don't think it matters if it is an obe or lucid dream.

Thank's Ralph for your comment but to me it is important.
<br>
<br>
It was not a lucid dream since I was not concious I was sleeping. I really thought I was having an OBE.
<br>
<br>
And I want to be able to believe that I really met my guide.

<br>
I read your post carefully, and feel certain that what you experienced was an obe.
<br>
<br>
What you write, to me, perfectly describes a typical experience that people seem to have at first. You find yourself somewhere, then you think, "Hang on a minute, this is different, this is so real, I'm doing it!"
<br>
<br>
This is a difficult one to describe, but there is a certain "quality" about an obe experience that distinctly separates it from a lucid dream. Once you sense that quality, it becomes obvious that you are not dreaming. There is a particular mix of excitement and a wonderous sense of knowing. Then, upon return to the physical, this feeling translates into a particular sense of joy that can last for days.
<br>
<br>
Controlling your actions on the Astral is mighty difficult, at first. What you need to do is: next time you find yourself projecting, rather than try and find any guides or whatever, simply concentrate on being still. Both in body, and in mind.
<br>
<br>
You see, it is SO darned easy to move around on the Astral. Such that you can cover huge distances in virtually no time at all. It is literally a case of, think of a place and then zoooom, you are there. Which naturally takes you by surprise.
<br>
<br>
Next you think, "Hang on a minute, I was someplace else a moment ago!" Then, chances are, you will think of an impression of "someplace else" and the next instant, zoooom, you are in a different place. Which again takes you completely by surprise, so you zoom off to another place, and another. Which all gets mighty confusing. Then, next moment, you find yourself back in the physical wondering what the heck happened.
<br>
<br>
Also, you will have to learn how to close yourself off to emotional thought. You have already discovered how a little emotion can have a big effect on your circumstances. Releasing emotion, on the Astral, leads to what I call a "buffer experience" where the circumstances created by your own thought-fuelled emotion become superimposed on the Astral scenery, in varying degrees.
<br>
<br>
When you met the woman, for instance, you will probably have released a tinge of sadness coupled with a degree of sentimentality. Which led to the buffer experience of the sobbing. The basement area was perhaps a little dingy and dark. This perhaps naturally led to you releasing a little fear, which fuelled the buffer-experience of the Zombies. However, rather than becoming ever more fearful, you simply dismissed them. Thus cutting their fuel-supply (so to speak) so they fizzled out.
<br>
<br>
Considering it was your first obe, I think you dealt with "them" brilliantly. Because releasing emotion is inevitable while you are still learning the basics. However, the way to deal with it is to prevent yourself from reacting further. If you can stay neutral and just mentally dismiss whatever comes about, then the emotion-fuelled circumstances will simply fade away. Thus leaving you to continue as normal. That's ever so easy to say, but *so* darned difficult to do at the time. But it seems you have a knack for it.
<br>
<br>
Also, please don't be surprised if you fail to feel the act of reconnection back to the Physical. Problem is, everything at the moment is happening too quick for you to feel it. The more control you can learn to have over your experiences, the more you will see and feel.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Wow thank you so much Frank! When I woke up i really felt it was not a normal dream, but something very special that made me happy and peaceful for days.
<br>
<br>
To tell the truth, you taught me a lot about emotions before and I too think my first experience was not too bad. For example, I really did not panic in front of the zombies, I ran away and they chased me, and I used my thoughts to make them disappear.
<br>
<br>
And you are right, when going down to the basement  (I was like brought there, I had no choice) it was dark and I thought "boy! What am I going to see down there?". This is probably the emotion you talk about that brought the zombies.
<br>
<br>
And now I tend to analyse this first experience and I wonder what was that shade man that I instinctively considered as my shade? Why the woman did not want to tell me her name? Was the journalist a dreamer in my travel or what? I asked my friend Guy A. Lepage and he said he personnaly knew him.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion : after this OBE I have no fear anymore to go to the astral. I just want to go back but consciously this time. I feel that everything you taught me (remember all my questions about astral danger?) and everything I read really helped me a lot.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank!

<section>
Thank you for your kind comments.
<br>
<br>
In my experience I have come to accept there always are seemingly unanswerable questions following virtually all my Astral adventures. As such, it pays not to question each event in minute detail (especially at first).
<br>
<br>
As you get more and more proficient at negotiating your way around, then the times when you get taken by surprise, either by some entity or other, or suddenly finding yourself in an unexpected place, become less and less.
<br>
<br>
The trick, as I say, is to first try and gain a sense of stillness of both the mind and the body. Which is easy to say but SO darned tricky to accomplish. But that's when the fun really begins as you naturally develop a sense of Astral confidence. Which means the place doesn't seem so vast and so threatening.
<br>
<br>
Now and then, I get taken by surprise and release a little fear. But I have the experience that, more often than not, allows me to have a little chuckle to myself as the energy dissapates.
<br>
<br>
In a way, it's just the same as on the Physical. When I was a boy, I'd think about what it would be like to be an adult. The thought seemed so daunting. All those bills to pay just to keep a comfortable roof over your head, finding a good job, and so forth. But now, in my mid-forties, I'm kinda used to meeting whatever cr*ap Physical life throws at me.
<br>
<br>
Also, if I may respectfully point out, you need to please be careful to avoid what I call: Astral-Anthropomorphism.
<br>
<br>
That is to say, attributing Human, Earth-aware Physical values, situations, events, etc. to Astral entities or residents. The woman did not refuse to give you her name. Her response was to acknowledge the validity of your question, but she didn't have an answer.
<br>
<br>
<u>
 Being a Physical-life, Earth-living visitor, on the Astral, has a certain kudos amongst Astral residents who have absolutely no concept of what it is like to be human in a Physical sense
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
You need to consider the fact that "she" may have no concept of what we Physical Earth-aware entities commonly call, "a name".
<br>
<br>
Plus, you talk about her being "your guide" but there are lots of guides who will help you. From her point of view, she was maybe just someone who was willing to be your "guide for that moment" or "guide for that event". Next, she is suddenly being hit by questions (from an incredibly advanced being, according to her) that are way out of her depth.
<br>
<br>
Please understand that your way, way higher (to them) knowledge of advancement radiates a particular "light". Which they can sense.
<i>
 Many of these beings will stand in awe of this light
</i>
. Though, naturally, at first, you will wonder what the heck is going on.
<br>
<br>
But once you have more experience in controlling things, you will automatically start to attract correspondingly more advanced Astral residents who can begin to explain things to you in a more informed way.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

What you experienced sounds like an OBE turned LD or vice versa...or somewhere in between.  Things like this are so subjective and abstract it's truly difficult to tell you what you experienced.  On;ly further experiences like this will be able to help YOU know...and the more you inform yourself through reading and meditation the more likely you will be to distinguish between the variety of phenomena.
