<section>
Hello everybody,
<br>
<br>
First, I'd like to say that I love this forum and all the enriching discussions we can find here. I've been around for many months now, but I never dared to post anything because, as you can see it, my English is disastrous.
<br>
<br>
Well, I wish I introduced myself under better circumstances, but a tragic event arose recently in my life, and tonight, I feel so desperate and so angry at the same time that I really hope that all of you, folks, will give me some help and some advice.
<br>
<br>
I had a lovely black cat whom I was really fond of. She was so cute and so nice, she was an angel... She used to go to a friend of mine's garden, just two houses away from my home, to play with bugs or to sunbath, but never further, and never longer than a couple of hours (my parents had her sterilized, so she was rather home-loving).
<br>
<br>
But last Thursday at dawn, she went off for her usual stroll before her "breakfast", and never was to be seen again...
<img alt=":cry:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cry.png" title="Cry"/>
I won't relate here how with my mother we searched and searched in vain for her, but as time goes by we have acquired the conviction that she has been killed by our neighbor, an evil man who butchered many cats in the past, just for the "fun" of it
<img alt=":evil:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/evil.png" title="evil"/>
.
<br>
<br>
So, to make a long story short, here are my questions :
<br>
<br>
1) Is it possible to use OBE to find out what really happened to my cat (remote viewing, Akashic Records, ... ) ?
<br>
<br>
2) If my neighbor is found guilty via 1) (he is too smart to leave any physical evidence), do you think it bad to seek revenge ?
<br>
<br>
3) How could I astrally get back at him ? What would you recommend ?
<br>
I know that this forum is not the place to get this kind of answers, and I am myself rather prone to forgive those who hurt me, but this b***** attacked an innocent animal, and I can no longer stand to see him watch my mother and me searching desperately for our cat with a little contented smile on his face
<img alt=":x" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/angry.png" title="Angry"/>
.
<br>
<br>
All I want is my cat back, I can't stop crying since she vanished, so I look forward to your replies, and I thank you for reading me.
<br>
<br>
Love.

Ha ha, if your english is disatrous, then my French has no chance... doesn't even register, lol.
<br>
<br>
Sorry about your pet, but that's life I guess. The French hunter fanatics shoot anything that moves. My friend has had her cats murdered, 2 dogs, her horse severely injured. The list goes on. The birds bury themselves in October and don't dare to come out until mid March when it's all over, lol. They just shoot at anything that moves. I even had a guy shoot at me once when I was walking through the woods, heard the shot whistle past my head, must have been only a metre away or so.
<br>
<br>
That's France for ya!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I'm so sorry to hear this story, Silent Hill!
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
The loss of a loved pet is very painful for us, people with big hearts.                                                                                                     About 7 years ago I lost the most lovable kitty I ever had. I felt so much grief and was determined to find out what happened to her. So, with her on my mind 24/7, of course these thoughts of her disappearing were with me as I went into OBE. So, I asked my higher power to show me where she was.                                                                                                      I first saw here skeleton on a rock, she was taken by a hawk. I then saw her running in playing in a field. This was her heaven. Of course all that we love in this world will be given back to us in the next. I know this to be true. I have seen and held many of my long gone loved pets during OBE experiences. Unlike most people I believe that we give our pets a soul  when we give them unconditional love threw their lives.                                                                                                    Don't feel you have lost your pet forever, because this world is only temporary. You will experience that love again in the next!

You cannnot use any of paranormal things being discussed here in this forum for practical purposes. This is the law.
<br>
<br>
PS:Get a new physical cat.

I know this isn't a very sympathetic reply, it's difficult to lose a pet even under natural circumstances. But where I live, it's perfectly legal to eliminate someones animal if it's found wondering on your property.
<br>
<br>
Not all people are cat lovers. I'm not a huge fan of them, especially when I find one of my favorite squirels, chipmunks, or birds killed by a cat. Nor is it pleasing to dispose of the victims when they are left in my yard for all too see.
<br>
I hate to see cat tracks on the hood of my, just washed, car.
<br>
<br>
It's not the cat's fualt though. They are just doing whatever it is cats do. I beleive cat owners should take more responsibility for their pets. In my area there is a leash law. It does not exempt cats. Yet I've seen only a handful of the hundreds of cat owners actually keep their cat's on leashes when they leave the house.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what the laws are in your area. If your cat can roam free on other peoples property without legal worries, then find physical proof against the man that killed your cat. If your nieghbor has a right to kill animals repeatedly roaming on his property, maybe you should find a way to keep your cat on your property.
<br>
<br>
Find out who is in actually in the legal wrong, and fix the problem there. It may not be nice for someone to kill your pet, but is it nice to let your pet wonder where it doesn't need to be?
<br>
<br>
Good luck finding a salution.

Sorry to hear about your loss.
<br>
Others have touched the two other points in your initial post so I'll just offer my input regarding

<br>
What would a revenge accomplish other than to taint the memory you hold of your cat? Certainly it wouldn't change anything in the quilty party's mind.
<br>
Revenge is for many a way lash out instead of stopping to contemplate and find out what life means to them. It's probably the result of frustration from the apparent inability to connect with the one who died.
<br>
Venting the frustration is ok but if you go after someone in order to do it you're mistaking the reflection and the mirror.
<br>
<br>
Oh, by the way, Like Frank said, there certainly is nothing wrong with your english.

I think that there's nothing wrong with revenge, it can be really funny if you have a nice idea.

If I were you, and I could easily project, then I'd try to take control of him in astral projection(Robert Bruce said that it's possible), and then do something funny(use your creative imagination for it)

<section>
Whatever you decide to do, at first make sure your neighbor actually did it.  Don't just go by unsubstantiated rumors in the neighborhood, or "he just looks evil" and whatnot, actually get proof.  There's plenty of (more possible) things that can happen to a cat alone by itself other than an evil cat killer, such as car accidents, animal control, wild predators, and many more things.

I think the only thing you should do is get a new pet.
