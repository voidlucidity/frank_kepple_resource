I was wondering if it was possible to astral projection my real time double and then just the mental astral of it, kinda like a thought form kinda astral projection. Does anyone think it's possible?

I think so- a man I read of once seemed to be able to sepparate his mind into at least three particualr spatial locations in one moment, and even be seen in these sepparate places! I would think that I would be more concerned with learning the basics first, unless you are already proficient.

hi catsyniki
<br>
<br>
I can't claim to know quite what was going on, but I have experienced 3 places at once.
<br>
<br>
1st Place - at home in bed in my physical mind
<br>
<br>
2nd Place - as a dream character, trying to get into another person's body thinking it will make me lucid
<br>
<br>
3rd Place - at home in bed in my "astral" mind, now ready to separate, if I so wish.
<br>
<br>
It was a really interesting experience, because at one point all three places vied for importance.  And I was able to switch between them for a brief period, until the 3rd Place took over and I became totally astral, losing the dream and the physical sensations.

When I was a kid ( 4 to 9 years old) I used to experience spontaneous oobe, of course i didn't know what it was about, I remember standing aside my physical body watching me asleep and having fun watching the rest of my family around the house.
<br>
<br>
Well , I remember an experience when I was in 2º or 3º  grade, I was walking to the quad and suddenly  I found myself watching my physical body from the left; There was 2 of me , one (physical) walking to in the quad, and the other watching myself. I remember shifting my consciousness physical to oobe double and vice versa. That was a shocking experience to me , now I think that there must be a way to experience that in a more controlled way.

<section>
hey when you astral project as it says in astral dynamics you mind gets copyed onto each energy body that you make and each goes of in their own plains and you are asentaly in many places at onec but the thing is when you reintigrate with your body you usualy forget all but one of those "shadow memorys" you know.

Selski,
<br>
<br>
Must have been a helluva mindsplit going on there.
<br>
How'd you keep a a solid memory of that, of all three bodies? Normally only one is DL'd into shadow memory area in brain.

G'day every one. I've just started to reread A/D again and funny enough I got up to were Robert was talking about how he was to close to his physical body and how he became aware of the two sets of different memory's by biofeedback. That could explain how there could be memory's of three different places at the same time. Bit of a mind bender but I would like to experiment with this. (Once I can oobe that is)

I haven't got a clue!  I know I try not to impose limitations on myself (such as "
<i>
 this can't be happening, it isn't possible
</i>
") and I keep very open and curious to what I'm experiencing.  Maybe that has something to do with it?

Probably by being able to consciously shifting the awareness from one body to another while in oobe.
<br>
<br>
I personally think (just a theory) that the memory that will remain in our brain is the one that will go with our awareness; so by being able to manage (shifting) the point of awareness while in oobe from one body to another, is probably the way to remembering events from different astral doubles in that particular oobe.

I mean physical, projected double, and thought form double.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm never sure why people would think this kind of thing
<i>
 im
</i>
possible. There are 4 basic focuses of mental attention within our wider reality and if you want to offer yourself an objective knowing of all 4
<i>
 at the same time
</i>
and confuse yourself silly in the process then why not. Most people get confused with just an F1/F2 or an F2/F3 overlay. But if someone really must then shoot for an F1/F2/F3/F4 overlay.
<br>
<br>
It's not for any normal person to place strict limitations on another person's expectations of inner possibilities. That's the job of old-fashioned mystics and religious zealots. They kinda specialise in that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
