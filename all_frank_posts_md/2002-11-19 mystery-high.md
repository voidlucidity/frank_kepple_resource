Did anyone here ever as a child think of the mysteries of life?, or why we are here or how from millions of years or evolution it leads up to this momment looking thorugh your own eyes.  I used to this this way as a small child and the whole overwhelming mysteriousness of everything made a buzz go off in my head that feeels so good.  I remember over and over filling my thoughts with mystery and wonder and my head would start buzzing again.  The buzz lasts only a few seconds but is a very pleasurable feeling that your whole body can feel but mostly in your head.  What is this?, recently ive been getting these "highs" again now that i am older while listening to a hemi-sync tape or a bwgen preset filling my mind with the mystery or wonder of what there is to know and might be available to me at any second.  Now that i am older sometimes this feeling is followed by a couple of flashes of white which i can see with my eyes closed.  Any ideas on what this is?, its puzzles me since a child.

Hi Asstray85.
<br>
<br>
According to Robert Bruce's "Astral Dynamics", your flashes could be your 3'rd eye "getting ready" ie. trying to start up. (It feel's like a stroboscope flashing in your mind/eyes).
<br>
<br>
But try and get a copy of his book, and read more about this fenomenon

Hi Asstray85
<br>
I know the powerful feeling you speak about. Pehaps it comes from tuning out the logical  cause-and-effect order of the left brain and tuning in the holistically spatial, pattern oriented ideas of the right brain.Nurturing a sense of wonder is a spiritual step in the right direction.

Hi. I have also had this feeling before. Once last month. It's very rare for me as well, but i feel this incredible sense of wonderment and say things like "How did we/I get here? Why is there life? Why am i standing here Why does anything exist at all? Why doesn't only Nothing exist?" etc etc. It lasts about 20 seconds or so. I wish this happened more often. It's fascinating.
<br>
So, does anyone else have unique states of awareness they would like to share?
<br>
Be well,

When you say "buzz" in what context are you using this word? Do you mean that you literally feel a buzzing kind of vibration like as if the upper part of your brain is physically vibrating. Or do you mean you get a mental buzz in the sense of simply being high on your own thoughts?

Hi asstray85,
<br>
<br>
Yes, I used to think about it, mysteries of life, and origin of consciousness... After few seconds, I had kind of buzzing in my head. I was afraid if I continue, I would go nuts. It feels also like some kind of pressure, or analogous to mental wall that you are not allowed passing, and which holds the answers...
<br>
<br>
It was in my teenage years, mostly, when I had no idea about astral or OBE. I think this it what, partly, pushed me to study these things.
<br>
<br>
I did not do it lately (few years), so it would be interesting to try again.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Dmitri.

Yes its a actual buzz feeling.  Like your head is buzzing.  Im glad that other people have experiences this before, i thought i was the only one.  Now only if there was information on exactly what this was.

Wow, when the Wonder hits me, I start bawling like a baby.  Real tears, I'm a mess.  It's fine when I'm alone, but try explaining to your boyfriend that you're happy when you're crying!  Sheesh!

It's your Crown Chakra (for want of a better term). With me it begins as a slight mental swoooshing sound that comes just as my physical body is dropping off to sleep. These happen about once every few seconds. Then they get progressively quicker to the extent where it feels like the top of my brain is physically vibrating and making a buzzing noise. Which it isn't actually, of course, but that's what the sensation feels like.
<br>
<br>
As I relax further into it, there comes a point where I feel a sensation of movement or a distinct mental shift in consciousness. For a fleeting moment I'll see an image of my physical surroundings as I pass through awareness of the real-time zone, following which the Astral comes into view. It's a way I have of projecting that follows a slightly different course than that of my Phasing approach detailed on other threads. It's sort of Phasing but with a few elements of the old projection technique I used to have.
<br>

Yours,
