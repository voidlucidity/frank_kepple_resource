Hi everyone!!
<br>
I'm new here! I have posted a little and felt it was time to introduce myself formally.
<br>
<br>
I am a stay-at-home mom with two kids and a hubby who sometimes thinks I'm nuts, but I'm pulling the string a little bit over my way and he is opening up. Lol, it was cute the other day he said what is the swirling blue and purple I get when I close my eyes!! His Brow Chakra is opening up unintentionally.
<br>
<br>
I started my spiritual development/awakening last November after a 7 year sleep. It started with ears ringing the day before the death of my best friend a 13 year old mixed breed dog, who resembles the beautiful Australian Shepard's with a bit of Collie mixed in. I thought I had a sinus problems and actually sent my hubby to the store to buy me a decongestant.  LOL I was so silly.  I was aware of a child spirit that resided in my home, but did not pay much attention to it.  Shortly after the death of my dog, (she lives on heaven mountain as my youngest calls it) I was able to feel more of this child spirit around me more so and on a few occurrences actually heard him speak to me.  After I got together with some friends (psychics) who helped this little guy cross, I began developing my medium abilities a bit more, then went on into Reiki and Energy work and Tarot.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I began to try to Astral Project a few months ago with small success.  My main problem being remembering what I was doing while out.  Along with this I noticed that I can now see outside my body it's like through closed eyelids that some of you speak of but it's way above my head and very unfocused.  If I try to focus I get so drained.  The main reason why I wanted to Astral Project was to help with healing and hopefully find other ways to help others using this. The signs were all there that I was learn to this and I'm hopefully going to progress this.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Reading!!
