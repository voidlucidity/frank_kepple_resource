<section>
well in particular the one that goes by the handle "Frank" why do you think you know what's real and what isnt.
<br>
<br>
There is no doubt while in the astral many of the entities are in fact thought but who are you to say therefore there are no real entities out there that outside of our brain and thought?  I have read quite a few of your comments where you say "these are thought projections and i dont know why people cant see that".  Im paraphrasing but do you really think you have such a better understanding of negative entities where you're the one who's right and the rest just dont understand or aren't as educated on this subject as you?
<br>
<br>
You also stated you were one of the people who Monroe has visited?  and he's mad at you?  Now if anythings a figment of one's imagination and wishful thinking its that monroe visted you and more than this he cares enough and you're important enough where he'd be mad at you on the other side?
<br>
I have read practically the whole forum in order to get an idea of what's happening and no one more than you stands out as being full of yourself and the belief the only thing real out there is what you experience.
<br>
<br>
To state all negative entities are just projections of ones mind is as narrow minded and as ignorant as those who state AP isn't possible because it hasn't happened to them.
<br>
<br>
I think on this forum more than any people should be careful about trying to enforce widely accepted "truths" such as there are no negative entities that exist outside of ones own mind.  IT may be true the only thing to fear is how your mind responds to these negative (as in an energy that takes energy from others) entities, it is ignorant and very arrogant to assume most or all are peoples own minds.
<br>
<br>
Just because it is plausible and is possible to create an entity with your fear it is not then a given that any entity is just a projection of that fear.  Long before I knew of astral projection and long before i knew what a lucid dream was I encountered these entities.  I then used them as a way to realize im dreaming and have lucid dreams so in my case the entities came first.. the lucidity came second.
<br>
<br>
I am not trying to attack you but you come off as the most arrogant and " i know it all" type of personality here and just wondering if you realize that.
<br>
<br>
No one here should claim anyone elses experiences are "just... " the fact most of us believe in ap and have people tell us they're just figments of our imaginations should make us steer clear of that type of judgment on others experiences.

i really get a good kick out of reading posts like that.  i haven't read any of the posts you are talking about but i'm going to post this just from reading your post.  there is a chance that what you are arguing is something that you agree w/.  there are many arguments that are started because of the syntax.  not only are those entities thought projections but everything you can ever know is a thought projection.  how can you argue w/ that?  how can u say that to state something like that is narrow minded?
<br>
<br>
also in your post you mentioned something about 'astral projection'.  what is 'astral projection' ?  could u give me a brief explanation? any help would be appreciated.
<br>
<br>
also,  i have known frank since the fourth grade.  you had better be careful what you say to him .  he's tough.  he can probably beat you up.  i saw him beat someone up once so i know he can do it.

Hi there, my friend.  I read what you're saying, but I'm almost positive that you're confusing Frank with someone else.  I don't *think* it was Frank who claimed to have been visited by Monroe.
<br>
<br>
I'm also not sure that Frank said a lot of those things which you're describing, or at least, he may not have said them in that context.  Is there anyway that you could copy/paste what he said, or provide actual quotes from Frank so we can understand more clearly that which you're referring to?
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, we have no idea that Frank is the person who really said those things.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>
<br>

Fred: LOL
<br>
<br>
Jeff: You are correct in thinking it wasn't me, but my instinct tells me the facts will make no difference on this one. I think the person in question just found themselves in the wrong forum. I was going to suggest they post to the PSD place, but it seems natural attraction has taken its course and they appear to be settling in there nicely.
<br>

Yours,
