<section>
in a spanish forum a guy from orense, a town of the north of spain told me this incredible case:
<br>
he was doing a course of astral travel and he saw himself floating, with a strange sensation, seeing the things distorted and fat
<br>
suddenly he saw to his girlfriend kissing and petting another guy...
<br>
when he turned to his normal state he told it to his girlfriend, and she got white like the wax.......she recognized that it was true.
<br>
the couple splitted up in that moment  : ))))))
<br>
the guy is absolutely convinced that the it was a real astral travel.
<br>
there is no intimacy on these days  : )))))

Just thought I would practice some of my spanish speaking skills, since it's been locked up in me for so long.
