Hi folks,  I'm new at this... only just coming to terms with the fact that these wierd "dreams" I've been having since i was 16 are OBEs!.. Anyway, almost all of my experiences had left me in a sheer panic due to paralysis etc. For a while I managed to get over this and explore some pretty exciting places... but then i started encountering some horrible scary demon-thing, and haven't been able to get past that stage again. Its just too scary. I hear a lot of talk about guides... what exactly are these and how oh how can I find mine?! I really want to try and explore this properly...

  Guides are people, beings really since some people say their guides don't look humanoid, who help you and give you advice in the astral realm. I've only had a couple of astral experiences so I can't really say anything about a guide I've ever had but in one of my experiences I went through something and it felt like I was the guide, but I highly doubt it really happend since I'm only 15, though the people felt real.

  Never forget that the worlds around you spin on their own axsis, not yours.
  <br>
  <br>
  You yearn for something you do not know, search for something just beyond your thoughts, long to return to a land you've never been to, and need something you've never heard of. Knowledge will fill that gap, as soon as you realize that knowledge comes after emotion and you need both to lay the foundations of your world.

Hi Meg,
<br>
Welcome to the forums!  Here is an affirmation from the Monroe Institue website, it is used in the Gateway Program:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 The Gateway Affirmation
</b>
<br>
<i>
 I am more than my physical body. Because I am more than physical matter, I can perceive that which is greater than the physical world. Therefore, I deeply desire to Expand, to Experience; to Know, to Understand; to Control, to Use such greater energies and energy systems as may be beneficial and constructive to me and to those who follow me. Also, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, the assistance, the understanding of those individuals whose wisdom, development and experience are equal or greater than my own. I ask their guidance and protection from any influence or any source that might provide me with less than my stated desires.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Robert Monroe mentioned in his 2nd book, that the addition of the "assistance" clause to the above statement, resulted in his OBEers progressing ahead VERY QUICKLY, due to the added help they received.
<br>
<br>
The night before last, I requested to meet with my guide(s) in Neutral Territory for the purpose of introducing ourselves.  I asked for guides that have only my best interest and well being at heart.  I had a dream, became lucid, flew up out of a house and travelled to meet a guide.  In a half dream/half OBE, I met a petite older lady with shoulder length salt/pepper grey hair, wearing a khaki robe.  Formalities were exchanged and I think she gave me a bracelet with mini purple stones/agates in it.
<br>
<br>
So, it can be as simple as asking to meet a guide (or your guide) that has your best interests and well-being at heart.  Ask them for help with your OBEs.  Expect this to happen, it will.  And be up front with them, in your request, regarding any aprehensions you have in meeting them.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to be asking for more guide assistance from now on.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

I am no expert but from the posts I have read it seems that you need a certain amount of control while out of body before you have any profound experiences with guides. This does not mean that you will not have contact with them before you reach that point, but I do think that they cannot help you a lot until you do reach a certain point in your growth. You should do as mentioned already here and try to have contact with any guides or helpful entities, but at the same time you need to be doing a few things. First you need to learn to get over your fear and control your emotions. As long as you fear this demon thing than you will not be able to get past it and grow. One of the first things to learn if you plan to do anything worth while on the astral is to get over fear. Not an easy thing to do by any means but it is something you need to do. Nothing can hurt you while out of body. If you give into your fear or any other emotion then things and whirl out of control, but nothing can kill you or such. Secondly you should not make assumptions but instead view everything with curiosity. Try to not make judgements about things as your thoughts can shift the astral and obsure what is true, or take you out of what has been called the Astral Proper and be put into more of a thought form playground. In your attempts to do these things ask for help from guides. Though you may not see anyone you never know if they might just be helping you in other ways once asked.

Ironic you should post this topic. I had a rather long OBE last night, and near the end, my MAIN goal was to make contact with a guide.  I called out, "Guide?  Hello, where are you?  Guide?"  Hehehehe.  For whatever reason or another, I didn't NOT make contact with anyone.  So I simply chalk that down as another OBE experience and hope that I get closer next time!

One more thing, and this is for FRANK.
<br>
<br>
Frank, when trying to make contact with a guide for the first time, do you suggest I try and do this in the first environment I come to while projecting?  Or should I try and go to one of the Focus levels, and THEN try and make contact?
<br>
<br>
I would think that I could do it anywhere, but having never met him/her, I don't have an ident/percept to pick up on.

<section>
Something I wanted to add. Guides seem to show up, or help you in some way if you need it. Awhile back I was laying down to meditate a few minutes before dinner. I started to project, I was still in my body but could easily get out. I suddenly saw this "portal" before me and a weird landscape beyond it. I was curious about it but the scene was so odd that I could not grasp it. I studied this portal for awhile and slowly moved towards it. Then this voice told me that I was not ready for that place yet. I am not sure who said this, but they seemed to be helping me.

Jeff: It's now got such a habit with me to ask higher entities for clarity, or understanding, or whatever, I even do it on the Physical. In answer to your question, you can ask for more understanding of a situation at any level.

Frank,
<br>
That happened to me Monday, while riding my bike home from work.  I was mulling over my faith, my beliefs and changing beliefs, OBE experiences, future what-if's and how all this could affect my wife and I.  I was also asking to meet my guide(s) while OBE ... shortly after, I received an internal mental voice saying, "That future may never happen, Greg."  It wasn't my internal dialog, so it was a guide or my Higher Self speaking.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Thanks Frank.  You know, every time I am out, I usually ask for "clarity," but I never attributed it to a guide helping me.  On the contrary, I simply thought of it like a universal astral law which works when you invoke it.  Perhaps if I think of these bursts of clarity as a sign of guides helping me, I can start to create the familiarity of having someone there to help me.  Then it may be easier to see him/her.   Hmmmmmm.....now you have me thinking!  I hate it when that happens!

KEEP TRYING! It took me several trys before I got a guide. This is how I finally did it: I woke up out-of-body. Then I concentrated on my mission plan- finding a guide- a good one. First I protected myself with a sphere to keep out negative influences. Then I called for a guide- before I had finished the sentance a brown thing leapt into my chest. I felt it rooting around in my heart area clearing out blocks (in my case deep sorrow.) Now I see it every day at least flitting around me as a blue ball of light. Although lately it has turned purple. I take this to mean it has developed since it has been with me. When you serve you grow.
<br>
I didn't understand why my astral eyes saw him as a brown blur, and my physical eyes saw him as a ball of blue/purple light. Then I had a lucid dream of him- He's a small swarthy elf like creature with a spear. Dark complected. And serious about his job as a guard. The blue/purple is his aura. (Just like my aura is purple- although my complection is not purple.)
<br>
The upper world guides I have contacted me first, in my very first OBE seven years ago. Then I couldn't find them again. It seems the upper level ones drop in of their own accord. You already have them. If you want an "everyday" guide just call one. Bur protect yourself with a bubble first.

<section>
hello - - - sorry but I gotta throw this one into the mix!
<br>
<br>
Do not presume, in your rush to find a guide,  that every entity you meet on the Astral has your best interests at heart.  You could get hurt or misled.  On the Astral, as on Earth, you will meet all kinds.
<br>
<br>
It might sound contradictory that I'm telling you to be open and guarded at the same time.  But I'm telling you!
<br>
<br>
Heaven knows I want a guide too.  In fact, I have two, but I don't remember enough to talk about them.  I don't know their names.  They've been around for many years and have been very, very patient with me!  Sigh!

<section>
Hi Meg,
<br>
<br>
Happy to see someone else from Melbourne on the forum (had a peek at your info)
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;. I thought I was the only one! Not that it is really important, but still nice to see someone here from close by.
<br>
<br>
I believe it is a case that our guides find us just as much as we find them.
<br>
<br>
For your question on finding your guide, a good way to go about this is first  work with what you believe in based on what you have already experienced. Have you already met some higher spiritual beings, or have a sense of higher beings, like angels, that have been around you that have given you a feeling of comfort or protection, either during an OBE or in your waking life? If not, do you have a very definite sense that angels or similar "good" higher beings exist?
<br>
<br>
Frank has pointed out that when you don't know which way to turn you should ask these higher entities for direction, but you need to be able to put these requests to beings that you definitely believe exist, otherwise your requests might end up being a bit vague and unanswered. Belief plays a key role in enabling you to "focus" your requests.
<br>
<br>
It was my experience that my own guide was waiting for me to find her, and had actually been waiting for me to find her for over 20 years. Guess I'm just a bit slow on the uptake! She came to me by way of a waking vision. After I spent some time in meditation I put a request to the higher spiritual entities for guidance for direction in my beliefs. In my case the request went to angels as I have had definite encounters with them before. At that moment, I saw the room I was in as if my eyes were wide open (they were definitely shut), and standing before me was a woman, who I have since found out is known as the Green Lady (actually a personification or avatar of Mother Earth, Gaia, Spirit of Nature, etc, you know who I mean I'm sure). Since meeting her I have found some books where people describe her pretty much exactly how she appeared to me.
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry If waffle on a bit about it, but I still find it quite exiting how I came to meet my guide, and who she is. Unlike yourself Meg, I haven't actually experienced an OBE, but I don't believe thats necessary to get to know your guide.  Though we're now in regular "mental" contact, My guide is now waiting for me and helping me to be able to conscoiusly project into the Astral so that I can meet her "in the flesh" so to speak. She came to me in my world, now it's my turn to pay her a visit.
<br>
<br>
Well Meg, that's my own personal experience. I hope it helps give you some insight.
<br>
<br>
Without quoting books or pointing to websites, is there anyone else who has met their guide that can give some details as to how it happened and what led up to the event?
<br>
<br>

<section>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On the subject of initial contact, I did go through a phase where I thought all this guide stuff was nonsense. But my curiosity got the better of me and I thought well, let's give it a go. So I mentally dumped all my thoughts of it being just some kind of mystical nonsense and began projecting with an entirely open mind on the matter.
<br>
<br>
I never forget the time when I was just floating in a load of nothingness, and I mentally said out load, "Okay, if you really are there, then please just say hello." And this female voice came back, as clear as day, saying "hello".
<br>
<br>
Well, hearing that shocked me back to Physical with a jolt. But since then I never looked back and I now wonder what I ever did without them. I've got two regulars, my main one Harath and there's this woman who keeps helping me but I haven't got close enough to start asking names and so on.
<br>
<br>
Also, I found there are what I call, "guides in passing". I perceive them as higher beings who just happened to sense I was having some difficulty and, as they were in the vicinity, they made a short detour to help me out. After which they just carry on with whatever it was they were doing. I've never actually seen these people, but I do sense them in the distance.
<br>
<br>
From my experiences, I would say the first step to take is to become open to the whole idea. Then just ask for help in a small way first. Also, be specific. It's no use asking for help in general.
<br>
<br>
Trust is very important too. People have this idea that the Astral is a really nasty place full of all kinds of devils and demons. Well, I've had my full share of scary moments on the lower planes, but none of these frightful situations can harm you in any way. And none of these people have any real power except to scare you, and cause you to release fear. Which instantly goes to creating and fuelling all manner of scary circumstances that surround you.
<br>
<br>
You quickly get to recognise higher beings because they radiate a loving kind of warmth. Which initially makes you feel all humble and gooey inside. But you soon get used to it. They can also read your thoughts and they will approach you in a form they believe will be most pleasing for you. That is why, if you read other people's accounts of meeting guides, the style of approach will always tend to differ.
<br>
<br>
Imagination, again, plays a big role. If you relax your mind and imagine the circumstances in which you would most like to meet an Astral guide, this will send out a powerful signal that you are ready to meet up.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

are there other entities that actually have the job title of guide? or are there just beings out there that happen to choose at that time to help someone out?
<br>
i'm wondering if you could ask for a  deceased relative to be a guide. also, assuming that re-incarnation is true, what if you wanted to meet a deceased person but it's been over ten years or so since they've gone?

something simple... you and your guides are not lost:) Your guides are with you from birth and you have known them before birth, they are with you. Its just a matter of opening up to them and realizing that they are with you, always have been:) They interact with you on all levels in body and out.

(it's funny after reading through a few posts... I'm wondering why you are all seeing your guides as an exterior part of you. Like guides are separate when they are apart of us. Your guide may even be you from a different time/life/experience. think about that one...ehehehe:)
