In my opinion, no one on earth is capable to talk to God directly at the moment.

Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
I've been looking at how God exists in reality from a couple of angles.  I believe God is not growing in essence.  His present essence has always existed and always will exist. What is possibly growing with God is the number of worlds and cosmos he is continuing to create.  God needs something to occupy his time, and to express his love and his creative nature.
<br>
<br>
So God is not growing in essence, but he is growing in the sense, that each time He creates another cosmos, that's one more cosmos that didn't exist before.  I believe God is capable of either contracting or expanding his essence.  He could expand his essence infinitely, or he could contract his essence if he wanted.  This is a great attribute of God, because it means whenever he creates a new cosmos, He can easily expand his essence to fill the entirety of the new cosmos he has created.
<br>
<br>
I believe one of God's first goals and priorities after he has created new worlds and new offsprings is to set up some kind of vehicle in each of those worlds through which he can introduce himself to his offspring, and then with their permission enter into them in an entity fashion.  I believe he does this by duplicating his essence and then contracting his essence to fit into our bodily forms with our spirit.  There would then be two spirits occupying the same body, the human's spirit, and God's entity being, both in the same body together sharing love with each other and sharing life together.
<br>
<br>
So can you talk to God.  There are presently two way you can talk to God.  God's essence fills our entire cosmos, so if you just say something to him from anywhere you may be, he hears you, and he is also there, just like he is everywhere else in the entire cosmos.  The second way you can talk to God is if you are able to find the vehicle that he has set up in the world which he uses to personally try to introduce himself to each and every human being.  Once he introduces himself, and you give him permission to, he will duplicate himself from his essence in the cosmos, and contract his essence to the size of your bodily form and enter into you as an entity taking up residence in you.  If that ever happens to you, you can talk to God directly in your spirit, and he will talk back to you from within your spirit.  It would be direct spirit mind to spirit mind communication.
<br>
<br>
Can you talk to God, you better believe it!

I believe God has spoken to me twice, very briefly, he is busy you know.
<br>
<br>
the first time I was lying in bed, awake, and despairing over a situation in my life. when I asked God about the eventual return of my problem, I heard a distinctly different voice saying "in good time."
<br>
<br>
the second time I was sitting in church (I go to placate the mother, I'm not a fan of organized religion although I am highly spiritual) and my piano teacher, collegiately trained in piano and violin, played a violin pieace. to my musically trained ear, her violin has always been wretched. well after her piece, the song leader gets up and says "this is just a little sample of what heaven will be like"...that voice popped up, laughing, and said "not even close."
<br>
<br>
but for the most part I figure he stays quiet. I think the first time he realized I needed to know he was there and there was a reason for what I was going through, and the second time was nice to know he has a sense of humor/ ear for good music.

   God can talk to us through signs if He so chooses.  Probably to reveal to us a path of life we should take for self-righteousness.  They aren't miniscule either.  Very obvious.
   <br>
   <br>
   This is all an assumption, but it's a darn good one.

<br>
<br>
Any common ghost could say those things, and I've heard they like to impersonate things humans believe in because its funny (I would if I were dead). That was probably not "god". You just want it to be. Just because you try to say it to "god" doesnt mean the message goes to "god" and nobody else.

<section>
beav31is,
<br>
maybe, but I'm inclined to stay with my original thoughts. I have a strong ability to sense ghosts and the like around me, how many there are, their sizes, and if they're malicious or benign. I've heard them since I was very young, and a couple of years ago began conversing with them. In the past year I've been opening up enough to see them at times. In particular, I had one that hung out with me on occasion, until he decided I was too boring.
<br>
<br>
I can certainly see where you are coming from though. there are probably plenty of things out there I have yet to encounter. it could've been a ghost too far away from me for me to sense, but in my experience I normally can't hear them then. and both occurances were in two places 90 miles apart, it would have to be a being that was following me. As I have experienced it; ghosts, like us, all have different voices. and this was the same voice. and in the second incident I hadn't attempted to talk, I was just suffering from the music when I heard the voice.
<br>
<br>
I hope this clarified my viewpoint. if you or anyone else has had experiences that could explain this as not being God by what I know, please let me know.

I think it makes a difference what definition of God we are using here. A Theistic God? Tao? and so forth.

A farther doesn't need his son but the son needs the farther.

Think and mediate on it...

Are you sure you are not getting confused here with the normal communication which takes place in most non-physical realms? From upper-Astral and beyond, mind-to-mind communication is the norm, not the exception.

In the vehicle in the World called "Christianity" which in a way is still learning and growing in many ways as a vehicle with a lot of hang ups and certain habits that it needs to get rid of.  In such a vehicle they believe that God is a Trinity.  So in that vehicle, the philosophy of whether a father needs a son is totally different from the belief mentioned above from another.  In the Trinity the father needs the son, the son needs the father, and the Holy Spirit needs the father and the son, and the father and son need the Holy Spirit.  There are different belief systems out in the world. Hopefully one day we will find all the correct answers.  Until then all we can keep doing is keep analyzing, searching and looking for the answers.

Hi Frank
<br>
<br>
Imagine you're best friend's spirit leaving his body and entering your body, and into your spirit with you.  Do you think he could communicate with you spirit to spirit with thoughts in that situations since both of you occupied the same body.  You're situation would be a situation where 2 entites were occupying the same body.  You would be able to feel the other entity in your body and spirit with you, and you could also communicate with each other very easily, if you were open to each other and the double residency was mutual.  That is the kind of spirit mind to spirit mind communication that I'm talking about.
<br>
<br>
Now replace your best friend's being and entity with God's being and entity moving into you.  It would be more than a communication, it would be a relationship with the Creator, God.  How God would possibly do this I have mentioned in an earlier post.  I think you just misinterpreted what I was trying to say about the communication aspect.

We are not sure who you mean by "God".
<br>
<br>
Within this Physical plane, God is a concept... anything from something to bow down to... to something to fight over. As Harath always says, those darned mystics who claim to have a private line to God, ought to be compelled to disconnect.

I am only as much as a contemporary voice as you or any other human being on this planet.  I would be careful about letting people's contemporary voices influence you.  Because there are others contemporary voices, and if you lived by the rule of letting contemporary voices influence you, you might choose to become a satanist.
<br>
<br>
I don't let others contemporary voices influence me, I look at all the different vehicles in the world, analyze them and make up my own mind on whether there is a God or not.  I have chosen to believe there is a God, and I have also chosen to believe in him.
