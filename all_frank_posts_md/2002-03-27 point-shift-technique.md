Hey, I was just wondering if you guys has the same experiences as I have when using the point shift technique, I just started practicing it, it´s really hard to "master" I´ve learned, hard to keep up the concentration level required...  but pretty much every time I try it I experience the vibrations coming on really quick. They may not be strong every time, but they are absolutely present for as long as I can keep up the point shift concentration to a good level, which isn´t very long yet to say the least.   I know what´s required though, practice, practice and... practice..
<br>
If this is the experience for most people, having the vibrations come on when point shifting, then if one learns to master the technique one should  be able to "go out" pretty much on demand after a while.
<br>
What do you think, is this the
<b>
 number one of all "techniques"?
</b>
My instincts tell me it is, and also may the be the hardest to master...  but who said being able to be a master is easy, if it were, one wouldn´t be a master....
<br>
<br>
Be well// Qui-Gon

Greetings Hephaestus!
<br>
<br>
Point shift is a very powerful exit technique, but does require an unwavering mental concentration level. You need to fully exteriorise your whole body awareness, to the extent you know beyond doubt that you, i.e. your awareness, are standing in your exteriorised body. You need to hold that situation, while being spatially fully aware of your position relative to both everything in the room, and your actual physical body.
<br>
<br>
If you succeed, the vibrations will occur, followed by the exit reflex.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Couldn´t have said any better than what Adrian just did Hep.
<br>
<br>
You may try and practice on it, but as someone said in an earlier post, you may want to put most of your energy on another more simple technique that does not require the level of concentration as this the point shift technique does...  but you might learn it to some rookie degree fairly quick, and you´ll encounter some vibrations or at least some energy movement sensations..   that´s the level I´m at currently, novice/rookie....

Point shift + [100%(concentration)]= success.

 I would add that full body relaxation and trance state first would help as well.
 <br>
 <br>
 Point shift is a "classic" projection technique in my opinion.
 <br>
 <br>
 Robert's rope and its variations have the benefit of inducing the trance conditions etc., as a component of the entire process, and is therefore a revolutionary new approach.

Also, u might wanna try the boomerang method, or whatever u wanna call it. You just bounce awareness from a point exterior ur body and back to ur brow chakra at intervals of about a second. I've been working on it lately, it works well, and it starts to become automatic, so it doesnt require so much mental effort. Maybe you can try boomerang into point shift for the exit, or into rope, whatever you wanna try.

Well I use something similar to this point shift technique and usually after half an hour I tend to get the tiniest sound in my ears that I heard the first time I ever had an oobe but the sound is very very slight and if it wasn't totally quiet in the room id never hear it - so I believe I may be on the right track but no matter how long I remain like that and attempt to relax etc the noise just doesn't get any louder and I start getting an itchy head or itchy cheak or itchy leg.
<br>
I feel i'm just not capable of inducing an OOBE and that I can get to a certain point but no further - even using the technique I used first time of waking in the night and trying it while very tired doesn't work.

 As Robert points out in AD and elsewhere, unless you have the right level of trance, and most importantly body relaxation - like you simply cannot feel it - *any* exit technique will be very difficult at best (rope being an exception), or impossible.
 <br>
 <br>
 Your best way forward is probably to focus on relaxation excercises - breath awareness is very good, and trance, and also meditation before worrying too much about the exit. Many people achieve spontaneous OBE's from these states in any case.
 <br>
 <br>
 Good luck, and don't be discouraged!

 Oh, the itch stage!
 <br>
 <br>
 I could write a whole book about those flaming itches.

 Look, could I please suggest you forget (for the moment) using any particular "technique" such as point and shift, ROPE etc.
 <br>
 <br>
 First, you need to find some "thing" to concentrate upon that is very appealing to you personally... but has nothing to do with sex, money, etc. Because it will all get too Primal and spoil it.
 <br>
 <br>
 You just need one "thing" that you can enjoy imagining to the extent you can hold that one image, in your mind, to the exclusion of all other images. And that is what you need to practice doing.
 <br>
 <br>
 At first, you will be able to hold the image for a few seconds and then you'll think of something else. But gather your thoughts and begin again. Keep doing this until you can concentrate solely on that one image for fun, if need be. At which point, you are ready to concentrate on specific images such as ROPE, etc.
 <br>
 <br>
 The key is to ask yourself the question... where, exactly, is your sense of conscious awareness coming from? That is to say, when you are doing the imagining: where is the image you are attempting to imagine coming from. The answer will be, at first, directly behind your physical eyes... even though your eyes may be closed.
 <br>
 <br>
 What you need to do is shift that sense of consciousness up slightly and to the centre. In other words, lock the physical eyes out of the equation.
 <br>
 <br>
 To me, it's almost like the eyes can't let go of being the dominant "visual" organ. They suspect you are trying to view some "thing" and it's like the physical eyes automatically take over saying, "Yep, we do all that visual stuff so get-lost the rest of you."
 <br>
 <br>
 The way I do it is imagine I am looking at myself in a mirror, and a red dot is painted on my brow. Then I estimate the position and try to see the same dot from within. Keep swapping from one to the other, at a rate you feel comfortable with, until you get a response.
 <br>
 <br>
 You will realise the difference because all kinds of "happenings" will begin.
