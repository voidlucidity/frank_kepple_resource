<section>
I have searched the net to find the frequency of the astral and mental planes. I have not found one article or web site with this information. If this is electromagnetic radiation, it's just a question of how many Hz , and it must be possible to find that
<br>
frequency-range. So does anyone know if anyone has measured the frequency of the astral plane?

No time in astral. Frequency undefined.

there is time in the astral, and even in dimensions above it. it just gradually thins out into nonexistance around the dimension that the heaven-like place exists.. from the astral on, it's severely warped and distorted until it becomes meaningless. this is all in astral dynamics.

I think it would be possible to find the frequency by measuring the energy transfer during telepathy. Just measure the frequency of emotional transfer between people, and you'd find the frequency of the astral plane. And measure the frequency of thought transfer between people, and you'd find the frequency of the mental plane.

  Frank, I picked up pretty quickly on your "Smiley" -- I just wonder if I missed one in Dr. Shaman's post. How can you measure the frequency until you can reliably and consistently produce quantifiable phenomena? Isn't that the Holy Grail we're seeking?

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
I think the question is not well defined. I think there are all kind of frequencies present in all dimensions. You can also ask what frequency defines our physical plane, then you see the laking logic behind this question.
<br>
<br>
You can however ask what is the frequency of the brain(waves), when one perceives the different levels! Or what frequencies are use to entrain the brain to have access to these levels.
<br>
<br>
I have commented on the Monroe frequencies on another topic

</a>
. :
<br>
<br>
" from all of Monroes books, including his biography: catapult and the TMI materials, I got the suspicion that the focus level actually is a direct reference to the (highest) frequencies used to attain these levels. It is not that simple! As I told you, they use a sophisticsted mixture of different signals. What I found out is, that
<br>
<br>
Focus 10 is mainly 4hz hemi-sync
<br>
Focus 12 is mainly 10hz hemi-sync
<br>
Focus 21 is mainly 16hz hemi-sync
<br>
allways together with low frequency signals, tones, music and pink noise.
<br>
<br>
So this did not quite confirm my theory, but I think one can see the system behind.
<br>
Its also quite sure that TMI sells a defused version only of their original resident programms and this could also imply, that they lowered the frequencies used. In this case my original theory would still hold. They sure lowered some of the signal volumes to make it saver for beginners."

You say you'll find the "frequency" of the mental-plane. But is that not the now equivalent of saying the answer to life, itself and everything is 42?

PS
<br>
Is there really a "frequency" of emotional transfer between people?

The frequency range of the psysical plane is all radiation
<br>
from psysical objects, ranging from IR or lower to UV or higher.
<br>
The frequency range of the astral plane is the radiation of emotions, spirits and other entities on that plane.
<br>
<br>
According to occult literature, the mental plane is on a higher
<br>
frequency than the astral plane. But how high that frequency is, is never mentioned. Scientists will never take this seriously, if we just talk about frequencis, but not how high they are and what kind of frequency.
<br>
<br>
How do we know that the mental plane is on a higher
<br>
frequency than the astral plane if we never measured them?
<br>
Acording to my own experience, the mental plane contains other information than the astral, but I'm not sure that it's on a higher frequency than the astral.

It is beyond calculation. Consider physical frequencies:
<br>
<br>
The frequency range of the human ear extends to about 40,000 vibrations per second
<br>
<br>
Electricity is around one billion vibrations per second
<br>
<br>
Heat comes in at around two hundred billion vibrations per second
<br>
<br>
Light and colour are at around five hundred billions of vibrations per second
<br>
<br>
X-Rays are at around two trillion vibrations per second
<br>
<br>
Yet these are still extremely crude, low vibrational aspects of the physical world. The Astral worlds alone are at rates of vibration that cannot be calculated - yet anyway - but are many, many orders of magnitude greater than the energies mentioned above. And of course these vibrations increase again through the levels of the Astral and Mental worlds until reaching The All, who vibrates so fast as to be considered almost to be at a stand-still.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

If it's electromagetic waves, ofcourse it can be measured. If it's not possible now, it's because our tools aren't good enough. But I'm not sure that all the frequencies on the astral plane are that enourmously high that you say. Some might be in the UV-spectrum.
<br>
<br>
You talk about both acoustic waves (The frequency range of the human ear ) and electromagetic waves.
<br>
These are two different things.

It seems everyone is assuming that the astral world (or any other world) would be made of the particles we know, photons, neutrons, electrons etc., just going at a higher rate.
<br>
<br>
This would seem to mean that if these particles could slowed down from their incredibly fast vibrations then we would be able to experience them (or maybe our scientists could).
<br>
<br>
What if the "astral" or even consciousness was made of something that is not like any form of matter we know. Maybe it is not matter at all but something different. Then it would not help us to know if it has a frequency or not.

Might this be what happens when ghosts manifest themselves?
<br>
<br>
If indeed the astral and mental planes are based upon energy, then yes they would operate whithin a range of frequencies. Photons are a good example of a particle to use here as photons exhibit characteristics of both particle and wave, so these particles can exist at different frequencies. Also consider that all matter, at the very core of its structure, is energy.
<br>
<br>
Adrian mentioned that frequencies in the astral are orders of magnitude greater than in the physical world. I agree entirely with this viewpoint, and it's what I believe is the essence of why the physical and astral realms coexist in the same location at the same time. Data can be transmitted via microwave and via FM radio through the same space at the same time. What keeps them separate is their frequency.
<br>
<br>
In the case of the difference between astral and physical, I see it as more like a quantums difference in both energy and frequency. E.G. if you take an atom, introduce a quantum of energy, the electrons are able to make a jump to higher orbits, and it becomes a different type of atom.
<br>
<br>
I don't believe we currently have the instrumentation to measure the frequencies of all energies present in the physical plane, let alone the astral.

Yea, it seems like no one knows the frequency of the astral plane.

Here is a lot for science to investigate in the future. Occult literature often say that the mental plane is on a higher frequency than the astral plane. How could we be certain of that?

Change of state - the higher the rate of vibration, the higher the energetic state. Solid -&gt; liquid -&gt; gas -&gt; plasma -&gt; ?.

It may be possible to record the aproximate frequency of the realtime zone indirectlly. Lower astral wildlife, negs, and spirits disturb EMF around them. Sort of like having something invisible touching a puddle of water and recording the ripples. Becasue they resonate so quicklly the "EMF ripples" actually come out in the MHz-THz range. Using astral sight and a hand held device I was able to "check" what I was seeing. Appaerentlly free floating globs of energy range in the MHz while anything dwelling in the realtime zone range much higher (I don't have anything sensitive neough to test them). Ofocurse this doesn't mean you can just hook up an electro magnet, tune it in, and make something materialize... This is an "indirect" measurement. You're only finding the right timing.

However... It may be possible to find basic frequencies using this method and create a digital cam to capture video at this frequency... You would need about 33 chained high quality CCDs per MHz and a digital signal processor cabable of muxing the video with critical accurate timming, all hooked up to a huge storage medium. (Its much more complicated than that but there's your abridged version.) Since I don't have the money to make something that expensive you'll just have to wait or build it yourselves. [
