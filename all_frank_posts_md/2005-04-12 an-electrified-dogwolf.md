This happened about 1 year ago.
<br>
<br>
I was taking a daytime nap, and during the end of it, I got a vision (In My dream) that there was this dog or wolf, and it was what seemed to be made of electricity, or well, it looked as if it was electricity in the form of a wolf/dog. And It was on top of me while i was in bed. And I could remember it grabbing my chest with its claws so hard. I started to tense up. My feet were pushing against foot board of my bed.. and my muscles tensed, and in the vision I was in MY BED, MY COVERS and MY ROOM. Once i woke up. Everything was the same, but there was no dog... the way my body was positioned, my feet were against the foot board, the way the covers were twisted up and in a certain position were all exactly the same as if they had jumped from my dream... It's like I was able to see CLEARLY through my eyelids.. and I was asleep.
<br>
<br>
I seriously got freaked out.. I have no clue what happened.. Can someone enlighten me if you know what happened?

just your subconsious keeping you on your toes is my guess. Â It could have been a negative entity, but if it only happend once, then I doubt it.

That's very strange that I saw the same vision of everything in a dream kinda weird.

It sounds to me like the energy centre in the region of your chest came alive in the middle of a lucid dream, and you were viewing the objective manifestations of this within Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Many times I will have a lucid dream and certain energy centres will be active. When my solar-plexus centre comes alive, for example, I always tend to dream that I am standing on the edge of some precipice, looking down at the ground hundreds of feet below. That's because this energy-centre gives me the same feelings when I look down from a great height in the physical. So the feeling is duplicated in the dream.
<br>
<br>
When I was younger, I used to have a recurring dream that I was standing on the edge of a huge suspension bridge looking down at the water a couple of hundred feet below. It was years later that I discovered what is was... just the objective manifestation of the feeling being played out within F2oC.
<br>
<br>
But if you'd take that notion to your average child psychologist they'd think bridge, edge, looking down, hmm, must be thoughts of suicide, depression, blah, blah, blah... no, nothing like it. It was just my solar-plexus (yellow) energy centre tingling away that caused the imagery to come about.

Wow, thanks for the clarity. I'll read up on it somemore.
