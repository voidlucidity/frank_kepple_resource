The newest incarnation of the Doctor is played by Christopher Eccleston (he comes from the north of England). Chris is a great actor, have already played non other than jesus christ (!) in the past; also some may remember his excellent performance as the Duke of Norfolk in 'Elizabeth', with Cate Blanchete.
<br>
<br>
The new series looks like it will be great, and although I loved Paul McGann as the Doctor, that US movie version was absolutley awful, showing they had no idea about how the show worked and the hallowed tradition it followed

. The new series looks to be back on form, keeping all the 'Who essentials' but also incorporating new ideas and better special effects.. but as all true Whovians know, its not special effects that make the series.. its the characters and the story!
<br>
<br>
I must admit though that my fav Doctor has to be Tom Baker!

PS Yes it should appear in the US at some point, at least on BBC America.

He he, this was once my favourite TV program. Showing my age a bit, but I actually remember watching the very first Dr Who. Memory of it is extremely vague but was totally entranced by the show from the moment I saw it. Though I think it was more to do with the horny assistants than the Dr's themselves, lol.

Billie Piper: isn't she the one who married the ex-Virgin Radio DJ (I think it was Virgin Radio and I forget his name, or was it Chris something? He is about 15 or so years older with bright ginger hair). If it is then I'm thinking of getting SkyTV just so I can watch it, corr... she's a bit of alright she is!

Frank: You have identified her correctly! She was married to the ginger moron, but that is now over!

It was said at the time it was never destined to last, but what a lucky bloke. She was only about 17 or something (actually I think she was 16) when he was first buying her flowers and stuff. A brand new Jag full of red roses by all accounts. Such a pretty thing she was too. Last pics I saw of her she was putting on weight though. Too much booze, I guess, as he was renowned for swigging it down and a lot must have rubbed off on her.
<br>
<br>
I suppose that's all done and dusted now. Nothing a few weeks at Champneys can't sort out when you are that age, and loaded, lol. Now she's in Dr Who. He he, there's a turn-up for the books. Lucky Doctor doubleyou, I say. If it were my Tardis I'd be trading the old Sonic Screwdriver for a King Size water-bed and mirrored ceiling... ha ha ha ha.

Yeah I watched Dr Who at the weekend with one of my friends. Needless to say I decoded it with him. It was quite funny how all the Dumi's started attacking the other Dumi's, I can really relate to Dr Who.

 I loved the first episode, but have to say I found the second one just...far too over the top. I thought they might have tried to avoid the Star Trek style aliens. I think I will always prefer the original series as at least it still had that quaint element to it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Also, Christopher Eccleston has quit the role already so after only 13 episodes, they have to bring in a new actor. They are considering David Tennant, star of something called Casanova. I will give it another go, but I found this last episode...a little silly.
