As the subject description says, I pretty much try every night and I can't seem to get back to F21.  I usually end up with LDs or RTZ projections early in the morning or before I go to sleep instead.  Does anyone have some sort of method or idea how I can get F21 again or why I can't seem to get it?

Your very action of attaining the F21 state widened your awareness to encompass all manner of other states. The more you know, the more you encompass and the more you encompass the more you know.
<br>
<br>
You never actually get to a point where you think, "Yes, I know it."
<br>
<br>
There is always a mystery to be solved. Which is all part of the fun, of course.
