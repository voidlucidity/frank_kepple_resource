Hello all,
<br>
<br>
This morning I woke up thinking "I know I had an OBE last night", yet I can't remember a thing about it!
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to download the memory of having an OBE without remembering a single detail?
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>
<br>
Jeni

Is it possible that what you recalled was the conflict between the shadow memories and the physical memories in which the shadow memories were erased? It is possible that you have the symptoms of projection to recall and the symptoms of having had some sort of problem but not yet have the projection memories.

Hello, Jeni, it's good to here from you again.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is possible. What happens is your conscious awareness comes awake to the point where critical and recognition factors start coming into play... but only fractionally.
<br>
<br>
So you wake up with a kind of memory imprint that recognises something specific, but with no recollection of anything generally.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
