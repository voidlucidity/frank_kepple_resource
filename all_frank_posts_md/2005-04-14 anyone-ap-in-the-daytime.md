wondering if anyone has AP in the day time, like on their lunch break in their car, at home with quick nap? Wondering if APing in the day might be easier or, if you enter the real time zone in the day, do you see people walking about?

<section>
very much feasible.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, u dont tend to fall asleep during an AP attempt during day time. All you need to find is a quiet place

<br>
Oh yes. Â Most of my "successes" are due to napping in the daytime.
<br>
<br>
I find that just before I naturally wake up, I become "aware" and have about two minutes to do whatever I so desire before I regain full waking consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Those two minutes are so precious, I often find my options are so overwhelming, I don't do anything

Most of mine are daytime ones too. All my RTZs seem to have matching weather/light, so a nice sunny afternoon is exactly that. There's not much to see at midnight in a dark house.
<br>
<br>
People are about too during the day, and you may or may not see them just as you may or may not see yourself!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Depends on your definition of "day", are you saying in daylight or between certain times?
<br>
<br>
With me, it doesn't matter whether it is night or day. Provided the room I am in is not too light and it's quiet then there is no problem. If you were to project into the RTZ while there were people about then you would see those people, yes. But you might not see them absolutely exact as you are generally subjected to all manner of varying reality sensations.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi izalco
<br>
<br>
Almost all of my projections occur during naps in the afternoon.I find a nap is more conducive to a light sleep state that is necessary for me to have much success.I get my best results when I can drift in and out of consciousness,placing an intent while I`m aware and then letting myself slip away again.
