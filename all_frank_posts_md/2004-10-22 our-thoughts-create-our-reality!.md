<section>
I'd just like to say that I am beginning to see and be very conscious of the fact that our thoughts do indeed create what what will encounter down the road somewhere. I have had so many instances in the past year or so that show me how the exact thoughts I was thinking later appear in my life as events. It is very clear to me now and I see how important it is to 'watch' our thinking and direct it into the channels that will benefit us the most and others.
<br>
<br>
So let us focus on the things we'd like to create for ourselves and others and think as little as possible on things we don't want in our lives, unless we are focusing on the solutions to these hurdles.
<br>
<br>
We are the trainers of our own thoughts, so let's take hold of the wheel now!

I am new to body energy and I am at the begging stages of learning and becoming spiritually aware, I believe that what you are saying is true because I have dreamed or thought about something only to have it happen later and It seems that I have done it before exactly in the same way I carry it out at the time. It is a weird feeling.

<section>
EnergyForce and friends,
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is a strange feeling sometimes when exactly what you wanted appears just as you wanted it as if out of thin air, although maybe a few days later.  I have found that the more details you give your ideas the more likely they seem to appear, with exactly those details.  Also thinking about how this would be of benifit to you and others seems to help by adding positive energy or giving it more strength.  Another odd thing that seems to help is give your idea a strange twist or unusual aspect, like where or how you will find it or something that might even seem to make it less likely to happen.  I think the main thing is to have fun with the process, like learning to ride a bicycle for the first time or something like that, and continuing to develop it by trying it on larger and larger scales.  I find that sometimes it will even work on things you want to change in the world, or on a global scale even.
<br>
<br>
I would also mention that I also have the same experiences with having a dream of something that happens the next day, many times.
<br>
<br>
I think we should definitely keep developing this ability and see how far we can get with it, as we may eventually find that there are actually no limits to what we may be able to create.  I might also suggest that we should do this together on certain things we want to change or improve in the world around us.  We could even try doing this for each other and see if we can get the same or maybe even better results that way.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Maybe we could start a little group here of those who have experienced this in the past, or even with those who just like the idea, and see what we can accomplish with a series of experiments/efforts.
<br>
<br>
If we can get real good at this it would become the easiest way to get anything done anywhere and would defintely "catch on".  I think we might have forgotten this ability we had ages ago and are just now remembering how it works again.
<br>
<br>
Be well, my friends...

<section>
Yes, that's so true. I've experienced my thoughts coming to pass more &amp; more over the last year, and am feeling increasingly confident in my ability to manifest. I'm also starting to 'police' my negative thoughts much more! I remember reading one of Stuart Wilde's books, where he  refers to the 'slowness' of energy on the physical plane, and notes that while it can be frustrating to wait for visualisations to happen when we first start practising it, it's good for those of us who haven't quite mastered positive thinking, otherwise all kinds of nasties would be materialising instantly all over the place! In that sense energy raising must happen at the same time as the development of mental discipline.
<br>
<br>
I like the idea of sharing our experiences in this area. It's inspiring to read about it working for others. I love the effortless quality to these experiences. I know they're not really effortless, as mental energy is involved, but it still runs against the grain of the dominant (very harmful IMO) belief in our society that hard work is necessary to achieve anything worthwhile. I prefer to believe, to quote the title of another of SWs books, that 'Life was never meant to be a struggle'!

Hello neutrino and all,
<br>
<br>
I would just like to post my interest in starting a group here and other places for the purpose of "joining forces" in this way of using the mind to help each other mainfest things in our lives.  I don't think anyone would need any past experience to help make a difference with this.  I have heard that when more people are working on something like this together, the power is exponentially increased.  For example if four people focused on the same thing the power generated would be equivalent to the power of 4 times 4 or 16 people working alone.  I wonder what we would be able to do as a team in this way with our working minds in unison on the same ideas???  Due to my previous successes in this area I would speculate that before long we might be able to even start manifesting things "out of thin air".  I wonder how far we might be able to go with this apparent natural ability that we all have.
<br>
<br>
Let me know who's interested in such a project, here or privately, and we'll begin the work!

And yet Stress Counselling teaches people to remember just how little the things they worry most about ever happen ... the message being "for all your worries and apprehensions, not much bad happens at all".
<br>
<br>
Then we have the New Age Doctrine that WISHES DO COME TRUE.  It is a hopeful premise, but, again, the counsellors come forward with advice not to spend a fortune on Books and Seminars to this effect.  For, with all the New Age Indoctrinations, we notice no new distributions from the Lotteries, and Poverty is growing in the very Societies that are most influenced by the New Age Propagandas.
<br>
<br>
So, no, thoughts do nothing apart from Will and Action.
<br>
<br>
And there is Truth in Prophecy NOT from those who actively try to impose their Imagination upon the Future, but from those who open submissively and passively to a True Discernment of Reality.  Indeed, that is the supreme lesson we learn from the Remote Viewers -- to in every way distance your subjectivity from what you are attempting to SEE.

<br>

I think that maybe most people's worries don't happen, but then neither do their wishes.  Perhaps it's a matter of focused energy &amp; intention - which will be stronger in people who have consciously worked on themselves. The more practised we become at manifestation, the more we need to be aware of what's going on in our thoughts. That is true for me anyway.
<br>
I certainly don't manifest things out of thin air (!) - although I believe that would be possible for a very advanced person -  but my visualisations are coming into being more quickly than they used to.  I believe that group consciousness can be powerful too - I'm reminded of the TM experiments in this area.

It's not so much that our thoughts create our reality, though I realise what you're getting at. But our reality is created in accordance with our core beliefs. That's why all this positive thinking stuff has little (if any) affect. People can think all manner of things, go around chanting what they like 'til the cows come home. But events only begin to change when core beliefs begin to change.

You are wrong Leo. You cannot change your reality only because your belief system won't let you to. I am not powerful at all, and certainly I am not a saint. I've used my will(I made a wish while being in trance) to gain money, and of course this manifested in reality. I've also used it to find cheapest engine for my motorbike, and next day I've found a 2500 ccm diesel for 200$. There were also many other manifestations, about 90% of my wishes came true already.

<section>
I agree here with Cacodemon.
<br>
We DO ALL have the ability to change our reality. It is only the church that would have you believe that only the saints have the power, just as they would have you believe that the only way to talk to God is through their priests.
<br>
<br>
We all have the power of God, the power of creation within us. It is our very soul - our spirit that IS this power. We experience this physical world around us by creating it how we choose. We can choose to accept humanity's group consciousness, just go with the flow and allow ourselves to think we have no control over our lives, or we can choose to manifest the life that WE want to have.
<br>
<br>
Those that have experienced astral projection are well aware that in the astral, thought = reality, and it happens pretty much instantly. Same thing happens in your dreams, which is just another way of your consciousness experiencing the astral. This same concept is just as real here in the physical, the only difference is we are experiencing thought = reality within the bounds of our perception of time, which simply meant things don't manifest instantly - we usually have to wait for them.
<br>
<br>
As with Cacodemon, I too have experienced manifestations of my wishes. In recent times, since I have become more aware, or more knowing of this fact, there have been many things that have been made a reality in my life because I CHOOSE them to be real. These things have ranged from personal relationship issues, psychic development, material needs and wants, my job, all sorts of things. I can honestly and confidently say that through my being more conscious of my life, I have changed things to how I want them. It really does work!
<br>
<br>
This is all simply done through setting your mind to something, being specific about what you want, then speaking out (to God, to the universe, whatever) your wishes. These are affirmations that can also be described as prayers, but ones that do not go along the lines of I WANT something, as that just tells the universe that you are in a state of wanting. That's why many people's prayers go unanswered - their too busy declaring a state of wanting rather than a state of being. Prayers or affirmations should be along the lines of I CHOOSE or I AM - a statement of fact to tell the universe that you believe, or more appropriately - you KNOW something that you wish for is actually true. What you believe to be true is what the universe will unfailingly deliver to you. Most people don't see thiat they're actually getting what they want because most people go through life unconscious of what it is they really wish for in their lives.
<br>
<br>
Anyone can do this, as everyone has the power within them. All it takes is living you life consciously - knowingly deciding who and what you want to be - creating yourself and your life.
<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,
<br>
James.

Also, a little off topic, theres a 'town' in Iowa (I cant quite remember the name) but most of the population practices Trandenscenal meditation and I think thier goal is to get however many thousand people it takes for them to all meditate at once to achieve world peace or something, might want to look into it.

<br>
What exactly is the difference between 'Core Beliefs' and 'thoughts'?  People born in the 10th Generation of a Voodoo Culture are no more able to win The Lottery then the silliest New Age House Wife.  The one has a 'core belief' in an essentially magical world, where the other was only taught such a thing at a recent Weekend Seminar that cost her $350, but the end result is the same for both.
<br>
<br>
I think we should look more to Will, Action and Agency.  Those successful in the Black Arts have been able to forge a channel of communication to Spirits willing to accomplish certain Supernatural Deeds in the interest of strengthening their partnership with the Living.  Those successful in establishing themselves in Sainthood are given access to Angelic Agencies.  'Core Beliefs' only matter in so much as they may have given some guidance in the achievement of these accomplishments of Action.
<br>
<br>
Indeed, most of our working hypothesises here in our endeavors to Project or Dream Big depend not on our 'thinking' or even on our 'Core Beliefs' but in rather achieving the objectives of the various techniques through deliberate and concerted action.  Will and Action.
<br>
<br>
But Will and Action would be entirely futile if exerted in a false or deadend direction.  So, from the very start of a successful Spiritual Quest there must be at least something of a True Perception.  'Belief' cannot show The Way.  There must be an actual perceptual discernment to lead from one Step to the Next.

 Sorry but I have tried to understand the idea of "core beliefs", it doesn't make sense. A belief is just a belief. Maybe there's such a thing as "co-beliefs", but this is more of a dependency and temporary situation. Everyone still has their own beliefs, an individual thing,and separate from a "situation".

 This is another example of a situation or circumstance, not the answer. People still have individual beliefs.Peace is a good idea, who wouldn't want such a thing! So far, these group ideas haven't worked.

Putting it that way, I can't say that I also have not on occasion been 'lucky'.

But I thought we were speaking beyond such ordinary things.  I was referring to the Supernatural... the Miraculous.... the 'changing water into Wine' type of thing.  There are no Saints today, that I know about, who can do such things... for whom the World is entirely plastic and conformable to their will and intentions.
<br>
<br>
But I am certainly glad that you, and others, are under the protection of Angels, or whatever, who see to it that you get those things that are important to you and your development as Spiritual Beings.  I myself say a prayer everyday, after The Rosary, to Saint Joseph beseeching his Protections and Intercessions, for just such useful concerns as you have mentioned.

I've owned about a dozen motorcycles in my day.  What motorbike do you own?

Saints had such powers only because they were very developed spiritually. But talking about things that are supernatural: there was a person on this forum, who could do telekinesis at will, and even recorded this on video. His name was Beavis. I think that every human can develop metaphysical powers, if he will put enough work into it, and we certainly don't need angels for this, they are entities similar to us, but more developed.

 My project is to build bike using Dnepr/Ural frame from heavy russian motorcycle, I will use the original gearbox and clutch, and install 2500ccm diesel engine from a farm tractor. It will get 30hp at 2250rpm, and will be 100% enviroment friendly when using biodiesel fuel

Wow!  I like the CZ... it reminds me of my first bike... it was a Kawasaki 500cc 3 Cylinder two-stroke. It was called a Mach3.  When you got the pipes just right it was really fast, but the frame was a nightmare and would flex back and forth at speeds higher than about 90.

Your project bike will probably be very fuel efficient.  One problem I always had with stock motorcycles is that they were tuned for peak horsepower rather than for fuel efficiency.  This give us vehicles that are just a fraction the size of a car but which get about the same gas mileage.  I would have gladly sacrificed 20% of my horsepower for 50% greater economy.

  But I thought we were speaking beyond such ordinary things. I was referring to the Supernatural... the Miraculous.... the 'changing water into Wine' type of thing. There are no Saints today, that I know about, who can do such things... for whom the World is entirely plastic and conformable to their will and intentions.

 Saints had such powers only because they were very developed spiritually. But talking about things that are supernatural: there was a person on this forum, who could do telekinesis at will, and even recorded this on video. His name was Beavis. I think that every human can develop metaphysical powers, if he will put enough work into it, and we certainly don't need angels for this, they are entities similar to us, but more developed.

I was wondering about Angels.  Certain angels are individuals that come as messengers.  Then I think of other Angels as agencies from God, but I suppose I could minimize confusion by calling such Agencies 'Graces'.
<br>
<br>
Regarding Saints, there are two kinds of Saints.  The lesser of the Saints are intermediaries of the Graces.  They must pray for everything.  They have no special knowledge beyond their experience, and they can't do anything directly.  Then there are the First Magnitude Saints who seem to have been given access to Supernatural Knowledge and who can act on their own Authority.
