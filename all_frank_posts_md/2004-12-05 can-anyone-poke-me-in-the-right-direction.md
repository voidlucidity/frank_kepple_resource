Hi,
<br>
Ok, so I've been trying to astral project for months now and I still have had no joy. I usually get to this stage: My body is totally numb, I can feel the vibrations and my heart starts to beat really hard. I get there most times but have never got further, could anyone give me some tips to achieve my first projection.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Lot's of people get to this stage and find they get stuck. Fear, apprehension, and so on is usually at the cause. Fear of letting go, and all that. It creates tension and breaks the state.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I think one of the biggest problems is relaxation.  If I am in a lotus position, indian-style, or sitting in a chair I can't get to where I normally get laying down.  I can get to about where you are but no further if I am in those positions.  I realized that my neck/throat is pretty tense during those and that's a huge problem.
<br>
<br>
To me it seems the most efficient way to project is find the least comfortable position that you could JUST BARELY fall asleep at.  Like for me it would be a recliner at about a 65 degree angle.  There my neck is supported and it won't tense up.  It's hard for me to fall asleep anywhere but a bed.
<br>
<br>
So I would say make sure every part of you is relaxed in the position that you are in.  And be mindful of your thoughts and see if deep down you have too much fear or anxiety(about projecting or anything really).

I too have only made it as far as you just described, but from what I've been told Frank is right (smart man, he is).  For me, I think its probably just fear of the unknown.  I think that with time it will pass, so for now I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and hope for the best.
