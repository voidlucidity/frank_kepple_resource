Hi there,
<br>
<br>
Just a few words from a new body.
<br>
<br>
I stumbled across this website yesterday - can't even remember the trail that got me here - anyway... I immediately started reading the FAQs and methods, printed out and read the 'Astral Signposts' by Charles C. Goodin and went straight to work at AP last night when I went to bed.
<br>
<br>
So I fell asleep... and tried again in the morning. Now then, I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and wake up with a numb (and sometimes painful) right hand most mornings. This morning, instead of hanging it over the side of the bed like I normally do, I put it by my side and started to concentrate on my third eye. Almost immediately, I went into this vibrational state. It felt like the buzzing of the numbness of my hand helped me to get there. It kind of freaked me out and it stopped. I lay there thinking that this was probably a significant event, although I had not yet heard of this state.
<br>
<br>
I managed to do it again and 'honed in' on it. It got quite intense and moreso as I concentrated more on my third eye and just let it happen. It went away again and I managed to get back to that state one more time. This time it was much more intense and felt good. It stopped and then it was morning time and my husband was stirring.
<br>
<br>
I've now read on here that this is indeed significant and have read how to take it a step further. I went for a 'nap' this afternoon to try it and couldn't even get to the vibration stage. I think there was too much noise from the crickets outside etc. I will be trying again tonight but will have patience...
<br>
<br>
Okay, so that was more than a few words, haha.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the great info - this is an excellent resource and I will be hanging around

Thanks for the welcome!
<br>
<br>
As an update, I've been completely unsuccessful in other attempts since my first 'beginner's luck' vibes. So, now it's time to browse and absorb...
