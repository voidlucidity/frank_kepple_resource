Does anyone feel that this may be there last EArth life cycle, or very close to it? Just curious, after reading some of Monroes books and becoming a practiced OBE'er (getting more comfortable with the experience, not so scared:) I am begining to sence that I  may be on my last life or very close to it. My overall view that I have is very beyond this physical and I have a innate sence that I am going to explore very deeply into myself and the energy systems that are around me. I have a deep feeling that I will find home in this life. I am only 23 but I do realize that I am very old, I have been here for some time. Does anyone else have this innate knowing that they are almost through with Time Space Reality?

That's an interesting perspective.
<br>
I also feel that sense of age, even though i'm 24.
<br>
But i think i still have so much to learn and i'm not sure whether i will get it all done in this lifetime! I'll guess i'll just have to wait and see.

I agree. It doesn't feel like the earth is going to be around much longer. There isn't really anything we can do about it either. Most people won't listen. I give 500 years at the most for this planet to live. Global Warming......

Even if this is true, what you should say is you give at most 500 years for the human race to live. This planet was around long before we were and it will survive long after we're all gone. Maybe we'll end up destroying most of its current life, but after a few thousand years, who knows? New ecosystems, new civilizations, new social order, with completely different species?

<section>
I've been thinking about this, what happens if we end up destroying the planet. Nuclear war, or an asteroid so huge that when it hits earth it leaves nothing but tiny fragments.  What happens then? Would the physical demension no longer be liveable?
<br>
<br>
This is why i think there HAS to be life on other planets. Our past lives, may have been on other planets. Think about it. The physical demension is so huge, with so many planets it would be imposible that life expirenced in the physical, is only at earth.

<section>
Anyone looking back through history will realise the "end of the world is nigh" merchants have been at it since time began. Logic tells us someone has to be right eventually.
<br>
<br>
There's a lot of alarmist bunkum doing the rounds. Global warming is a favourite. Fact is, though, the Earth has been heating up and cooling down for millions of years. Wasn't it only around 10,000 years ago we were locked in an ice age... and now we are in a warm cycle.
<br>
<br>
I think what people are worried about is the rate at which it is warming up. But that's just the planet's way of dealing with all the crap we fling into the atmosphere, and the way most people in the western world continue to live. At some point large numbers of people are going to realise we are enclosed within a fragile eco-system flying through space at however many thousand miles per hour. But I very much doubt the planet is going to be all that concerned.
<br>
<br>
A lot of Humans will have a hard time of it, almost certainly, but the planet will be here for a good many years yet. Fortunately the reign of the money-grabbing ego monsters is reaching the end of the line; and it is these people who will ultimately suffer the most. They passed the point of non-sustainability in the late 1970's and their days have been numbered ever since. Over the following decades, we will gradually see the empire of the ego monsters being replaced (as all empires are, eventually) with a more balanced breed of human; people who will build a new style of political system with compassion at its core, as opposed to advanced missile technology.
<br>
<br>
Someone is currently doing the rounds saying it's going to explode from the centre, as the centre is a big nuclear reactor and she's gonna blow. Yeah, right, and the moon is made of Swiss cheese. :)
<br>
<br>
These environment merchants ought to get their facts straight. I remember in the mid 1990's when there was very little rainfall in the UK, water reserves were low and all manner of pundits were spouting about how this was due to global warming and that is how it is going to be from now on.
<br>
<br>
I distinctly remember a water-board official saying about how the reserves of water were so low it would take three years of extraordinary rainfall for the reservoirs to be full again. An impossible task, he said, given that due to global warming we are to see incredibly depleted rainfall figures from now on. Funny how in the next three years we had such extraordinary rainfall all the reservoirs were full in just 12 months!
<br>
<br>
Then, a couple of years later, on comes another environmental pundit from the water board, claiming that this increased rainfall is the result of global warming, and that's how it is going to be from now on. Exactly the opposite of what they were saying two years previously. Fact is, scientists can't even predict simple weather patterns with any real degree of accuracy. Never mind what it's going to be like in x-number of decades to come.
<br>
<br>
For example, I was never all that interested in watching the weather forecast but since I move to France and started growing all my own vegetables and stuff I started watching it. All I basically need to know is whether it will rain overnight or not: because I need to know whether to water the vegetables, etc. Where I am, piped water is fairly expensive so considerable savings can be made by not watering if it is going to rain.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if it is the same all over, but in France on the evening forecast they first give you the weather as it was that day. What flaming use is that! I suppose they do it as a form of self comfort. So they can look back and think, well, at last we got something right this evening.  Because they are so far off in their forecasts it's unreal.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<br>
As with most prophecies, predictions, and with "holy books" etc, almost everything has misinterpreted by translating into purely physical terms when in fact they are highly symbolic.
<br>
<br>
The so called "end is nigh" prophecies do not refer to an impending physical disaster like an explosion from within the centre of the Earth, or a "pole shift" due to Nibiru, etc., but rather a Spiritual or more precisely energetic shift; a dimensional shift if you prefer.
<br>
<br>
As you may know, everything in energy originating from the Source, The First Cause, and that energy is characterised by vibration that gives the illusion of solidity in the physical world. Everything and everyone in the physical world vibrates at around the same frequency at a physical level in order to appear "solid". The prophecies say that we are due for an increase in vibration of the physical planet Earth, an "etherealisation" towards the "4th density"; i.e. the physical world will increase it's vibration towards the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The prophecy goes that only those humans who are sufficiently evolved, in other words are able to match the increased vibration of the physical planet will physically survive, and those that cannot will leave their physical bodies, or in material terms "die". Of course, these people will continue to live in the Astral, but wil no longer have the opportunity to use the physical world to evolve; which of course is why we are all here.
<br>
<br>
When will this happen? The Mayan Calendar says 2012.  I am personally of the view that this increase in vibration is an ongoing process, and the changes that Frank mentions are a part of that process along with many other changes in the world. It might well be that 2012 or other dates might be pivotal in various ways, we will have to wait and see

I agree that there will be some big changes but these changes will be political and social changes, due to having been forced into it by the enviroment.. its always the way, people will only start doing somthing about it once they see the way it affects them.
<br>
<br>
I certainly dont believe in 'vibration changes', apoclaypses etc that is all crap. and if anyone else mentions 2012 and 'demon wars' I'll make them eat their manga collection which inspires all that teeny dribble. Sorry for being a cynic but I've heard it all before, july 1999 anyone?
<br>
<br>
I also get annoyed by the phrase 'end of the world' and 'destruction of the planet'. While I agree that we are harming it (and this is wrong;we have no right to inflict all these problems on the earth and all its species), we are slightly above ourselves if we think we can actually destroy the earth itself or all life on it.
<br>
think of the big asteroid that hit earth 65 mil years ago... wiped out 98% of ALL life on earth.. a few million years later, you would never have noticed, apart from all the new life forms of course.
<br>
<br>
What we should be saying is that we are risking *destroying humanity*. the earth itself was here before and it will still be here long after the human race is a distant memory.
<br>
<br>
btw because I dont believe all these witterings about vibration changes etc, but at the same time I have a high regard for Monroe, I have long been vexed at all that weird earth change stuff he was going on about... with his visit to the earth in the year 3000 etc.... it all seemed a bit dodgy. perhaps he misinterpreted or it was a test; or maybe it IS true!

<section>
Douglas: I see again we are aligned in our thinking in many ways. Mankind gets so carried away with his ability to destroy, it's like people get drunk with power and fantasise of the "ultimate destruction", namely, the very destruction of the planet itself. While the eco-systems of this planet are fragile, and we are wrecking them at a phenomenal rate, the planet as a whole is as tough as old boots to the extent where there's no way we could demolish it. We'd just destroy ourselves in trying.
<br>
<br>
That's why I so like your phrase, "and a few million years later, you would never have noticed." Because it spells out the sheer length of the timeframe the planet deals in, as compared to our own lifetimes. Planet earth will be here for billions of years yet. So what's a few million by comparison... it's nothing. We'd wipe ourselves out; rivers would be flowing with radioactive waste and the seas polluted likewise. But a few million years later all the forests would have regrown, animal species would return, etc., etc., just like they have done in the past.
<br>
<br>
Regarding Monroe, I too thought he was going off on a tangent. Thing is, though, I managed to replicate most of his, what you might call, saner stuff. So I'm holding an open mind on the Y3000 experience. Question that sticks in my mind is, was it symbolic or was it literal? I suppose we'll only really know the true answer to that in another 996 years.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Frank

Major Tom: Yes, absolutely organic. I've had the estate for eight years and employ a number of people to work the land. The place was used as a holiday retreat two or three times a year. But about a year ago, when I retired from the rat-race, I decided to live here on a full-time basis. It was only then I took up an active interest on what goes on here. So I'm a newcomer too.
<br>
<br>
I love the idea of growing my own but doubt if I could get enough of a variety of produce to be self-sufficient. It's possible but a lot of hard work! The main crop is olives, tons of the things, which are pressed into oil. Plus loads of figs and cherries. I mean way, way more than we here could ever consume.
<br>
<br>
So the oil, figs and cherries are traded at the local organic cooperative for foods that aren't grown on the estate, plus other items such as rice and things like soap. We do the obvious, i.e. carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, onions, green peppers. Next year I might organise some lettuce and herbs. What I really do like is never having to go to a supermarket.
<br>
<br>
If I'm short of something and I can't get it from the cooperative, then I know several other organic growers in the region and I simply trade something with them. Seldom is it actual cash has to change hands. Personally, I love the way it works. I'm surrounded by farmers all doing their own thing and not a large corporation in sight! It's really wonderful.
<br>
<br>
As I say, I'm new to it all myself and I'm learning from the guys I employ to work the land, so I don't have any book tips. But if you know a good one or two, then please let me know. Regarding the root cellar, no, not exactly. But I do have the back room in the old part of the house where I store things. I think it must have been used as a wine cellar as there are no windows. The walls are at least 2 foot thick and the sun never penetrates so it's always cool in there. The thought of making one has crossed my mind, though.

<section>
This sounds like what they use in the Bible to get you moving towards spirituality.
<br>
<br>
If you are not "saved"you will go to hell when you die.
<br>
<br>
If you are "saved", when you die you will go to heaven.
<br>
<br>
If you are not "saved" on the last day "the end of the world" then you will perish and spend eternity in "damnation".
<br>
<br>
If you are/were "saved" by the last day the dead will be resurrected and transformed along with the living to live in the new heaven and earth.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you had spiritual awakening and raise you vibrations when you die you will go to a higher astral plane.
<br>
<br>
If you haven't raised your vibrations and are still dominated by the ego and its attachments, when you die you will go to a lower astral plane.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have raised your vibrations high enough you will be able to remain on earth with a etheralised body.
<br>
<br>
If your still dominated by the ego your body will die and you will go to the astral, and not be able to return to earth for further development.

@JRD - I had for quite a while a similar perception that this might be my "final focus" and recently I got what I would call an "offical confirmation".
<br>
<br>
There's what I call "symptoms" that might tell you if you in your "final incarnation":
<br>
<br>
- restlessness
<br>
- a certain boredom
<br>
- no wishes for kids, or marriage
<br>
... there are more I just not recall...
<br>
<br>
perhaps that might be of any "help":

This is an interesting toping as I sometimes feel that this may be my last incarnation, or at least for a while, I feel that the the present time cannot really show me much more and feel that I would be most likely to return more further in the future, its just a feeling I have.
<br>
I also believe that the physical plane has to exist also, even if the Earth dies I believe that there will be or are other planets where life would continue. Life to me is a little like a training simulation on a computor - its somewhere that we go to to learn.
<br>
The only thing that bothers me is that there may not be doughnuts on the next plane of existance!

Leannain, it was an experince that seemed to be a teaching. I was receiving images and infomations for them. There I saw the Earth's surface and envionments, and some nice phases that 'will come'. It was just a voice telling me, I didn't see anyone. Was pretty much like watching a documentary, but it didn't show people, just places. Can't recollect much more
