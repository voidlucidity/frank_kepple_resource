Alright so I was playing around with phasing. I made some good progress as I was able to view some clear images. However excitement took the best of me and I lost the images after a few seconds.
<br>
<br>
While I was phasing I became side tracked and eventually fell into a dream state. Now I have BIG PROBLEMS remembering any form of dream so I will try and explain this to the best of my ability.
<br>
<br>
In this dream state I was sitting on a bed, I was not lucid but I remember trying to explain phasing to someone. Suddenly I heard a very strange noise:
<br>
<br>
If anyone knows what these are they might understand.

These are springs that go behind your door so the door does not hit the wall and scuff up the paint when opened. I don't know if anyone has ever taken one of these while mounted and flicked them but that was sort of the noise I heard. I know for sure the noise took place inside of my head however it was very loud and clear. I could hear vibrations almost.
<br>
<br>
I was immediately awakened, paralyzed for a couple of seconds, maybe less. I was then extremely relaxed and in a sort of trance. However excitement got the best of me once again.
<br>
<br>
Anyone have any clue as to why this happened?

thats funny I know exactly what they sound like, when I was little I used to mess with those things all the time.  I have heard sounds like that while trying to phase before and I dont know why, it just happens.  When you start to get deeper into your own mind things tend to sort of flow free, whatever they may be.  Strange noises, strange images, even when you are dreaming this can happen.

This is really strange. A couple of days ago I was getting allot of imagery and I heard the same kind of sound. The noise came from inside my head. It was the funniest sounding thing at the time. It just came out of no where and completely broke my concentration. It's common to read about these types of noises but it was the first time I ever heard something.

So does this mean I am making progress or I have a problem?

Doesnt sound like a problem at all.  I wouldnt read into it too much.  Random things like this will happen along the way, just log it in a journal and forget about it.  Maybe it will happen again and you can compare experiences or maybe its your mind trying to tell you something.  Its too early to tell AND anything is possible while phasing.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You need to prepare to hear all manner of pops, bangs, shouts, roars, screeches, tearing sounds; people calling your name, hearing music coming from nowhere; all manner of taps, knocks, sounds like a door slamming, booms, whistles, whispers, laughter, screams, etc., etc., etc. As Knightlight says, don't read into it too much as these random events tend to be all par for the course. :)
<br>
<br>
Naturally, if you start to get something that sounds significant then by all means spend a little time trying to track its source, or whatever. Perhaps it may lead to something interesting perhaps it won't. Nothing ventured then nothing gained as they say. But random stuff is to be expected and it's best to simply ignore it as these are, by definition, just one off events, just meaningless random noise.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
