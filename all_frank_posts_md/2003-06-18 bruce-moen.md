i was just wondering if any one can project the way that bruce moen describes in his book. its just that he doesnt really give a how-to chapter as most other books do, so if any one does have a method of projecting his way useing intent instead of the traditional way could they please post. [

Hi blink182,
<br>
<br>
There is a member here named Ginny who does retrievals. Take a look at her thread entitled "a Focus 23 retrieval". That should answer some questions for you.

<br>
<br>
Also, try typing her name in the Astral Pulse "Search" or "Advanced Search" at the top of this page. Look for her posts say, in the last six months or more, and you'll find a number of posts where she explains the Moen process.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Bruce Moen cannot "project" in the conventional sense. He readily admits he has no talent for it. Instead he markets a system of, "focussed awareness". As Nick says, Ginny is our resident Moen-school expert.

The various posts of this thread bring up an intersting point. Ginny's accounts of retrievals (using Moen's technique) are quite interesting yet can they be considered astral or ethereal projections? Bruce Moen's method is different yet does it lead to an out of body experience? Or are those experiences another state of consciousness/being??
<br>
I would be greatly interested in any comments.

I would say yes, but I guess it is unfair to answer on behalf of Ginny. There was a thread in "astral conciousness" re. this issue.
<br>
<br>
The main point is the reality of the experience for the person in question.
