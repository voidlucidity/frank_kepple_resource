Hi Everyone,
<br>
<br>
I recently purchased Mastering Astral Projection and have only finished day 2.  I'm having trouble with the body awareness system.  I have to visualize because I can't get the tactile memory thing down.  Will this impede my progress?  Should I stop the visual and just deal with the frustration of the tactile system?
<br>
<br>
Also, I kept getting pains in my knuckles during Day 2's energy work.  Day 2 you focus on the knuckle.  I don't have arthritis and there's nothing in the book about feeling pain in the knuckle.  Does this mean anything?  I didn't feel any other sensation other than that.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for your ideas!

Obviously you are welcome to post your question here if you wish, but the thought occurs to me there is a whole section devoted to this book with one of the authors on hand to answer questions. If you posted in that section you might get a more direct answer. But the choice is yours like I say.

Yours,
