Hi,
<br>
<br>
I just found this site. I think it is a nice place to be able to "talk" with people with the same interest. I did some courses on the Mysicweb site, about astral traveling and gaining more consiousness.
<br>
I like everything that deals with that, specially astral traveling,.
<br>
<br>
regards,
<br>

What a sweet name, Little Star Orion, where did you get that from? I think it's ever so cute.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for liking that name. I made it one day I had to create a pseudonym. Orion was already in use, also Andromeda and every single name for the constellations I wanted to use, so I thought, I put something in front of it. I have always been a searcher for the truth of life and so I thought, I want to be light, good, but I still am searching for it, and am influenced by the bad, and have not yet reached enlightenment, so I thought little star is nice (it has the potential to grow). After I created the name I found out that Orion is actually a big hunter. Something with power, and that is actually quite useful when fighting against negativity.
<br>
<br>
A little story behind my name.

Regards,

Hi.
<br>
<br>
Why is my attention always drawn to Orion when I'm out at night?
<br>
<br>
Has anyone else felt this draw that for me seems hesitant yet appealing?
