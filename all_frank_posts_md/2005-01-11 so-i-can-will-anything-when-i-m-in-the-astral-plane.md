You would almost certainly not get the real thing, but you'd get a dream image that looked just like them. . .

Hello:
<br>
<br>
You can basically do what you like, there are no "sins" as such. Think of it as a huge adventure playground, go there, do what you like; then, after however many years it takes you to get board of revelling within your own imagination, you might want to get a little more serious and find out about the wider reality.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Yes, you can do what you want.
<br>
<br>
Sins? No. Just keep one thing in mind: You might encounter beings which are not part of yourself, which means, if you mess with them, they might mess with you. Just like in RL.
