I'm finally able to concentrate on practicing phasing regularly again.  I've had lots of "ordinary physical" stuff going on in my head for a while and it has had to take priority.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, this morning I was back, bouncing on my trampoline.  I was having a difficult time getting my jumps aligned.  I kept going too high, or started going in slow motion, or what have you.
<br>
<br>
I persevered and concentrated solely on getting the image of me jumping synchronised with my internal jumps (if that makes sense!)
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
This was taking up ALL my concentration, in that I wasn't aware of anything else, no physical body, no life on earth, nothing, just solely focused on my jumps.
<br>
<br>
And then I realised that where my 2D blackness should be (even though I wasn't observing it), there was a row of trees.  I had a couple of seconds before my mind de-concentrated from jumping and my physical eyes went to look at the trees, upon which they promptly disappeared.  And in this couple of seconds, I was able to simply observe the trees.  Hurrah
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that was too much excitement and I spent the next five minutes wondering why it had happened, before I got up to write it down.
<br>
<br>
Progress, methinks.  And it was only day one after a long spell of next-to-no practice.

nice!!!! thats solid progress I assure you.  Now all you have to do is not move your physical eyes and work on entering those images.  Its hard but you should atleast have some accidental successes along the way to controlled experiences.  Your on the right track.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This is another great example of someone making spontaneous progress by mentally reaching for the particular focus state. I was saying on a thread the other day that the approach I teach is very pro-active in nature. I have had people write to me with problems and, when we've analysed it all in detail, it became obvious that these people were merely laying back and hoping that the physical would go away somehow and then it would all start to happen.
<br>
<br>
The key to this whole approach is getting your focus turned inwards. Your mental rundown is the tool that assists you in doing this. You will note how Sarah says that her attention was completely taken up by her mental rundown to the point where it captured her focus completely. This is exactly what you need to aim for.
<br>
<br>
Of course, as she made the switch and then realised she had made the switch, her eyes went to try and snatch a glance at what she was perceiving. This is usually the next problem that needs to be overcome. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Ahhhh...So that is what I'm doing wrong.  I try and snatch a glance as well, causing it to disappear.
<br>
<br>
Sarah, thanks to your account I finally get it.

Hi Nay
<br>
<br>
Glad to be of service!  I keep posting my snippets of progress in the hope that it'll help someone else.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I've now got to learn how to keep my physical eyes firmly under control.
<br>
<br>
And stop them doing this

thats a funny emoticon sarah, and perfect for the situation!  It can be SOOOOOO annoying fighting your eyes.  I was having amazingly clear images flash for me this morning but my eyes naturally just snap to them.  Sometimes I get lucky and I guess forget about my eyes just for long enough and BAM!  im somewhere else.  Now stopping from being too excited isnt easy either, but progress is progress, and any progress in phasing just makes me more hungry for success!  Keep it up!

I've had this happen to me 3 times in the last week.  I do my rundown until it's like I fall asleep, then I'll get a glimpse of a "real" image for a second or two, and then it fades away.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday I found myself on a train looking out the window at the most beautiful field of tall, green grass go by for about 2 seconds, then it faded to my eyelids. Holding this is the next step I guess.
<br>
<br>
Also, the images I see never have anything to do with my rundown. For some reason, I assumed my rundown was what I would "see".

MT - I

I know what you're talking about.
<br>
<br>
I had the chance to play around with the images early this morning.  I was very drowy (had just woken up), so that probably helped enormously.
<br>
<br>
I saw a bathroom and just as I was about to look, I thought, "woah, stay where you are" so I did!  And I was able to watch the bathroom for a bit.  I'm sure it was a major revelation, but because I was
<b>
 so
</b>
sleepy, I can't remember much of it now!!
<br>
<br>
It reminded me of being underwater and when your physical eyes look, you pop up to the surface, breaking the spell, as it were.  Staying under the water in that drifty calm place is where one is able to observe, I think.  When I started to "look", I felt like I was coming round from an operation and everything was rushing in on me, C1 was zooming at me at 100 mph.  Normally I can't stop it, but this morning, I was able to slow it, reverse it and go back "down".
<br>
<br>
And that's what I noticed this morning

I agree 100%!  Thats exactly how it feels to me.  I often think of it as a see-saw where you have to keep it balanced in the middle.  You go to far up and your moving your eyes, you go to far down and its nap time.  Its a balancing act in my mind.
