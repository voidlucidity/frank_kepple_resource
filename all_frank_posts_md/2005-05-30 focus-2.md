I'm not sure exactly when or if it happened.
<br>
<br>
It could have happened when I was drifting off to sleep.
<br>
<br>
Maybe when I had like a minute go at trying the bouncing visualization.
<br>
<br>
I may have woken up and by chance done it.
<br>
<br>
Or i may have changed state while asleep.
<br>
<br>
<br>
All I remember was i was seeing one image then suddenly and explosion of images crossed around across my view and in my head. Then they faded and there was a single image and i felt something new. Cant remember the image, maybe a moon. Dunno.
<br>

Peace, Love and Light,

Hi:

<br>
That's a typical spontaneous burst of Focus 2.

Yours,
