Hi:
<br>
<br>
I believe it's a kind of fungus, sort of, mushroom like. Something that when ingested can give a person whacky experiences.
<br>
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
But it
<u>
 is
</u>
a kind of fungus, I just checked. Do a search on philosophers stone +fungus.
<br>
<br>
I thought it was, because they talk about it here. Where I live is truffle country. In the late autumn they come along with their trained pigs, sniffing them out from the roots of all the oak trees in the woods around here.

<section>
'The Philosopher's Stone' is the first of the series of Harry Potter books.  The stone is prized because it is said that even if you are within a thread of dying the stone will bring you back to life.  It heals, regenerates and provides the possessor with immortality.  The stone was wanted by the evil Lord Voldemort who had killed Harry's parents because he had tried to kill Harry with a curse and it backfired and killed him.  Voldemort however, survived by taking over the bodies of small animals.  The animals didn't live long and he was eager to get the stone because it would bring him back to life.  Harry thwarted the attempt and the stone was destroyed.
<br>
<br>
By book five Voldemort, through the aid of a servant, a Death Eater called Wormtail, comes back to life but he isn't exactly human yet.  He is sort of like a cross between a snake and a human being.
<br>
<br>
Book 6, comes out in early July and the movie later in the year.  Can't wait!  Grab a copy of the first one and have a read.  I thought it was all hype and I wouldn't read or like it, but I got hooked against my will.  Wonder if there isn't some sorcery going on about the book.

<section>
He he you see, Nay, they are the ones confused, not me, lol. If you read the actual question then the answer is clear. There is a significant difference between The Philosophers Stone and a philosophers stone. The latter is what the original poster is asking about, not the former. Unless jason got his grammatical expressions in a twist. :)
<br>
<br>
The answer given by NLC is also incorrect, as his response clearly opens with, "Figuratively, the philosopher's stone....". When the original question clearly states, "What
<i>
 exactly
</i>
is a philosophers stone." An exact definition, by definition, cannot be a figurative definition.
<br>
<br>
So that's 2-0 to Frank, ha ha ha ha ha...

 In modern times, Philosopher's Stone has become a slang name for an hallucinogenic mushroom, Psilocybe mexicana or P. tampanensis, closely related to the more well-known Psilocybe cubensis. See Psilocybe.

<section>
Telos:
<br>
<br>
I'll give you half a point, lol.
<br>
<br>
It depends on the slang used, of course. If it is common slang then this is merely a situation where people are using different words that are ordinarily known to describe a particular thing. That is what I meant by "actual slang name" in my previous post. In other words, in this event I would argue there is no metaphorical element.
<br>
<br>
My example, here, would be that of the noun: bling-bling, as in ostentatious jewellery. This is clearly a slang term. But note that the common meaning of the noun
<i>
 is
</i>
the meaning I have described. Bling-bling has no other
<i>
 more common
</i>
meaning from which an implicit comparison may be drawn.
<br>
<br>
As I am sure you are aware, for an expression to be figurative there must be a metaphorical element that creates an implicit comparison.
<br>
<br>
I do accept that a group of people may, for one reason or another, develop a particular manner of speaking where certain figures of speech represent other known words or phrases. That, of course, would be speaking figuratively. For example, the term "mechanic" representing the term "assassin" in underworld patois. This is clearly figurative as the term mechanic, to most people, ordinarily means one thing, yet to the group in question it represents another thing entirely.
<br>
<br>
The question, here, is not whether slang, per se, is figurative speech or not. Because when you analyse the facts of it, in some cases slang could definitely be said to be figurative, and in other cases slang is merely the use of a more commonly known term, for any particular thing.
<br>
<br>
The key questions are:
<br>
<br>
Is philosophers-stone a figurative representation of a certain hallucinogenic mushroom? Or is philosophers-stone simply a common-o-garden, modern-day term for the said fungus?
<br>
<br>
In evidence, I refer you to your source, who clearly state, and I quote:
<i>
 "In modern times, Philosopher's Stone has become a slang name for an hallucinogenic mushroom, Psilocybe mexicana..."
</i>
<br>
<br>
I would suggest, therefore, the latter of the two questions above could be the only rightful course.
<br>
<br>
According to your source, the term philosophers-stone, these days, has but one common meaning. In which case there can be no metaphorical element. Hence no implicit comparison can possibly be drawn
<i>
 between
</i>
philosophers-stone and the hallucinogenic mushroom in question. For the simple reason philosophers stone
<i>
 <u>
  is
 </u>
</i>
[/u] the applicable term for the said mushroom, and is not a common term for any other thing in accordance with our current understanding.
<br>
<br>
That concludes the case for the defence, your honour. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours in sport,
<br>
Frank

It's the Self!
<br>
Check on 'philosopher stone' and 'Jung'.
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 A later account (this is taken from Jung's Alchemical Studies) says: "And as man is composed of the four elements, so also is the stone, and so it is [dug] out of man, and you are its ore, namely by working; and from you it is extracted, namely by division; and in you it remains inseparably, namely through science." Also, "The whole of nature converges in man as in a centre, and one participates in the other, and man has not unjustly concluded that the material of the philosophical stone may be found everywhere."

According to legend, the Stone, a freed form of the spirit of Mercurius trapped within the prima materia or initially unprocessed raw material, grants immortality, heals all disease, and transforms base metals into gold.

Well if you werent to refer to the harry potters series its something an alchemist ( quite rare these days) would see it as a gift from the gods in a metaphoric sense. Its purpose that could best be served would be to defy the laws of equivalent exchange. Such as make a tree something of equal value must be given. with the philosophers stone thoses rules do not applie at all. Giving on going energy supply. Without things to give equivalent exchange you cant really do anything the only thing I can do is make energy portals around the house to give a good flow its pretty cool

<section>
Ooh. BTW, if you are talking about the figurative version... (I'm not asking to getin on the argument) many people argue that the philosophers stone CHANGES PURPOSE according to the users definition.
<br>
<br>
For example: Quartz can easily be one persons philosphers stone if it is potent and grants "abilities" the person would not normally have. IE: auric vision enhancement... (GREATLY CHARGED stone.)
<br>
<br>
Another example is Kundalini. If the goal of a person would be to gain imortal life or heal themselves, Mr. Bruce himself hints that Kundalini, if GREATLY advanced, might be able to REVERSE the aging of the physical body. Plus, most of us know that energy work is a rather potent at healing.
<br>
<br>
Just a thought.

the philosopher is the seeker
<br>
the fool who becomes the magician
<br>
but ultimately returns to become the fool
<br>
once again on the journey
<br>
<br>
the stone is the seeker's anchor which once removed
<br>
allows the seeker to fly
<br>
untethered  by its weight
<br>
as a Phoenix to enlightenment
<br>
<br>
but the stone is a unique impediment for each seeker
<br>
so perhaps it is best to describe it as
<br>
the fungus
<br>
after all
<br>
the part around the heart of the seeker which can be so delicious
<br>
<i>
 as are the ways of the world and
 <br>
 ..... truffles
</i>
<br>
<br>
or so deadly ...
<br>
<i>
 as a poison
</i>
<br>
<br>
is the stone the Akasha then ?
<br>
as the self connected with the universal mind ?
<br>
the truly controlled spirit
<br>
.... thought word and action
<br>
<br>
or is it the mundane negativity and ego
<br>
of the physical self of each human
<br>
that makes the boots lead and the spirit heavy ?
<br>
is it only what we must rid ourselves of
<br>
the traps of mind body and soul
<br>

come to think of it i never saw a fuzzy one what is he on about
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
oh well .....
<br>
these are thoughts truly about the BASE nature of humanity ...hmmm
<br>
<br>
Jesus is a Philosopher's Stone for some seekers but  a catalyst too ...
<br>
Christ can be the shepherd of souls  to enlightenment
<br>
and paradoxically the one who may prevent it's noble inception
<br>
due to the perverse nature of many of his  followers
<br>
to remain cloistered and separated  in the paddock
<br>
with mufflers and blinders
<br>
<br>
unable to leave the familiar ground of Hollow Heavens
<br>
as Robert Monroe would say
<br>
<br>
IT is a paradox that the religious often are clouded
<br>
worse
<br>
than the unaware
<br>
into mindsets that will not be liberated
<br>
<br>
how curious
<br>
that some become so steeped in religion
<br>
as to lose sight of its ultimate goal
<br>
and sink lower than the stone they arrived with
<br>
into a sea of lost souls
<br>
unaware of their beauty or even their own death
<br>
<br>
...The Christ is a bringer of sheep to the turning away
<br>
...to be slaughtered once more in vain
<br>
or to rise a notch more and move forward on their journey
<br>
<br>
All paths lead to God
<br>
each seeker has a stone
<br>
the rolling stone gathers no moss
<br>
and no fuzz either lol
<br>
<br>
don't search for the stone
<br>
as the ultimate  treasure
<br>
it is but a stepping stone
<br>
to your own path

That is a fantastic post (poem actually), redcatherine.
<br>
<br>
I've often thought of it as a tool of ascension.
<br>
<br>
Even the turd can be seen as a metaphor for unrealized forms of conciousness,versus the conciousness of someone who,at least
<i>
 seeks
</i>
trancendence .
<br>
<br>
And,in a minor form of syncronicity,there's a child beside me in one of those covered strollers beside me in the library,who cries because it looks as if she's trapped in it,and doesn't even have enough room to stretch her legs.She obviously wants to be free.

Could be the Emerald tablet of Hermes--the writing of which was used by all alchemists, and Sir Isaac Newton spent more time on this than he did on physics.  Supposedly he managed to unlock it's secret and when asked about it refused to discuss it, stating that mankind was not ready for what he found.

OK!....it is not a fungus...its not even really a stone....(well kinda), its mysticized in alchemy to be a kinda of crystal that maintains a liquid form...when alchemy energy (the will used to decompose and rebuild an object) is pushed through it the will power is amplified a hundredfold....

The Philosophers Stone is the universal medicine, it is also a real stone.  It can be used to transmute substances.  It is also VERY rare.

In fact, the stone is a state of mind. If you read a bit about cabalah and the tree of life you can see that the different states of existence are divided in chakra-like spheres called sephirots. Each one is asociated with a planet and a mineral or stone, linking that planet vibrations with the energy.
<br>
<br>
There's a sect like group named "Golden Dawn", very experienced in kabalah, which use tarot cards (a pictorial representation of those energies) to contact them in meditation session where imaginary journeys are lived.
<br>
<br>
The relationship with those archetypes is different depending on your astrological chart. They may be in good aspects or in tense ones, so you relationship with them would be different than your parent could have, for example.
<br>
<br>
As you dominate, know or understand the different realms of thought your mind goes upward the tree, "collecting" more parts of the stone. Different crisis may arise because your ego will be dissolved in certain states and it has defensive mechanism to keep its stability and not lose control. Also, the "heavenly" knowledge gather will spill downward enlightening your earthly life and transforming your whole existence.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure but it is something like attaining the buddha or christ state, which are minor states compared with the high enlightment in which you'd surpass the very limits of existence as known here, in astral or mental planes, a karma fulfillment state wherein you'd be free of any debt.

Hhmm surprising. Yes "Philosophers Stone" is a particular strain of mushroom from Holland I believe, very nuggety, very spiritual effect (tears of joy, enveloped in love etc etc - quite amazing) &lt;caugh&gt;
<br>
<br>
But to get to the original point, wasn't the philosophers stone able to provide immortality as well at metal transmutation?
<br>
&lt;cau(ORMUS!)gh&gt;
<br>
<br>
IMO there are many different ways of looking at the issue, from an actual substance to a spiritual metaphor - of course that will be the case with such an obviously esoteric subject which has survived mostly through mystic tradition and a few dusty books. Which makes things tricky. Now that doesn't mean the mean the metaphorical ideas have nothing to them, and it also indicates that we should keep an open mind to the literal interpretation. IMO, of course

does anybody know what Migs was referring to when he said "Emerald tablet of Hermes"?  If it's texts that could be aquired, then I'd like to know so I could take a look at them.  If this is just me being ignorant, tell me that to.    XD;;;
<br>

Thanks

Surprised no one has mentioned the "Blue Apples"!?!
<br>
<br>
If you're interested in this subject, the emerald tablet, alchemy, etc. I think you might find this site very satisfying.

Hey, thanks a ton for the website.  I'm doing some research on the topic (for my own) and was wondering if anyone else has information sources that they'd like to share.  It would be most appreciated, and thank you in advance.
