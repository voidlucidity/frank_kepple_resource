Hi!

<br>
Im a 22 year old norwegian male, who started to get interessted in "self development" and spirituality about one year ago.  _alot_ of  "weird" things have happened that really changed my life and view on every aspects of life..
<br>
<br>
I didnt know much about UKO/Astral travel a few months ago, and it all started with me starting to fall out of my body/moving around on my bedsheets while trying to sleep. I didnt know there was such a thing as UKO when it happened but i started searching around the internet to find out what was happening, because i was really really afraid..
<br>
<br>
A few months ago, while laying in my girlfriends bed and trying to sleep i started hearing these "ringing noises" in my ears and my body kind of "froze", i suddently found myself on the floor and tried to get up but i fell every time i tried to stand.. i could se almost clearly, but the air was kind of "foggy". I got really scared and called out for help, and said i didnt want this and after a few seconds i was back into my body but could move any thing, not even my eyes until maybe 30-60 seconds later.. After this i have tried several times to get out of my body controlled but i only seem to be able to "freeze" my body, and get my legs out.. Ordered the book "Mastering Astral Projection" from amazon a few days ago, so im really really excited to start training, and trying to remove the fear that i think is blocking me from travelling..
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once more, thanks alot for a great site!

Hi Naovaaka
<br>
<br>
I've moved your post to Members Introduction, where I think it is more appropriate.

<br>
<br>
Welcome to the site and thank you for your introduction.
<br>
<br>
It sounds like you already have had a couple of experiences, so at least you KNOW you can do it.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you'll enjoy Mastering Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
We look forward to reading about your future experiences.
