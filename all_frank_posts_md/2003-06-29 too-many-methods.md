<section>
Ok, I have managed to get out a few times now on my own, but I read so many articles and books about astral projection that all the methods  are starting to blend together.
<br>
<br>
So, generally, I wake up a bit earlier than usual and do some light Yoga or similar excercises, have a glass of water ect. then I lay back down and my body is very relaxed, I stare at the inside of my eyelids and silence my mind, then I end up asleep. But, I wake up a little bit in between my dreams and so I noticed that if I concentrate on the details of the dream, I can let it pull me back in, and if I tell myself that I am going back into a dream and I am already outside my body...lo and behold, I find myself in my bedroom in my 'other body'.
<br>
<br>
So, I have no idea what I am doing...it's not in any of the books, this method. Well, parts of it are. And there is no hypnogogic state, I haven't had one of those for years, it isn't quite a lucid dream and I am not using any standard way to roll out or climb out, and there are certainly no vibrations or anything like that.
<br>
I would like to fine tune my experience, but I am not sure where to start as this is the only method that seems to produce any results, and yet it's not a precise one.
<br>
<br>
any suggestions to fine tune my technique of getting out?

That method seems pretty good. Not all people experience vibrations. The only way to fine-tune it is to find out different variations in your technique that work and practice with them.

Best of luck,

Dear Sister,
<br>
There are no hard and fast rules for any spiritual practice.  There is only what works for you and that is a gift.  One thing that worked for me was to prepare by lighting and clearing the chakras, and 'imagining' myself going up the tube of light that was entering my head.   It's effective and simple.  With your experience, the trick would seem to be for you to learn the means to use what is happening.  Your soul obviously knows the way for you,  so feel free to experiment often and your way will become clearer.  love always. tayesin

What you are doing is sending an element of conscious awareness along that centre-road which exists between being fully asleep and fully awake. That element of awareness then enables you to "wake up" from the dream. It's quite a good method of projecting and something I used to do for years. The only problem with it is the blank period which occurs between falling asleep and coming awake again. This can make it a bit unreliable.
<br>
<br>
I found the chances are higher early morning. Because there was less of a tendency for me to fall asleep completely, and just wake up next morning; which, from what you say, is what you are finding; in that you are managing to recognise (and, therefore, take your sense of conscious-awareness down) that centre-road between being asleep and awake. Which, in a nutshell, is all Astral projection entails.
<br>
<br>
The way to fine-tune this process is to try and eradicate the blank moment when you fall asleep. This makes the process more reliable because at no point do you lose consciousness. As you lie back, try and just passively observe yourself falling asleep. It's a bit of a tricky mental balancing act, and one of those things that is far easier to say than to do. But it's by no means impossible.
<br>
<br>
Basically, you are looking to follow that same "centre road" as you are doing now, only beginning much earlier. That way, as I say, you avoid any blanks in conscious awareness.
<br>

<section>
Frank,
<br>
that is exactly what it feels like...as if I am using a road in between dream and awake to project. Couldn't have said it better myself.
<br>
<br>
How long did it take you to get rid of the middle man, the in between black out spaces, and fall asleep fully aware? I know it's possible, but it seems like such a daunting task for me.
<br>
<br>
Tayesin, I think my soul knows a lot more than it's sharing...lol
<br>
Thank you for the help guys,

I've been practicing staying conscoius when I fall asleep for the past month or so and have had amazing results with the past 2 nights bringing me lucid dreams, to bad they end after a couple seconds to one minute after becoming aware.  While these weren't wake induced lucid dreams they were due to my daily practicing.  I have gotten very close to staying conscious while falling asleep, but also find myself trying to look with my physical eyes whereas the dream scenery is happening in my minds eye.  That normally pulls me out of it.

Yes, I know this feeling only too well.
<br>
<br>
I've posted on this before. How, just as I started to make progress, and began perceiving images in mind, my physical eyes would suddenly attempt to "snatch a glance" at whatever it was. Which, of course, would zap me right out of it every time. It took perhaps 3 months of daily practice to get out of that habit. It was a major stumbling block for me.

My main problem is trying to get up.  Why is my body so heavy?  It has happened several times.. I get all the vibrations then see thru my astral eyes.  The last time this happened (posted under Whoo hoo)I just said to myself forget it I do better in dreams..then projected some where else.  When I have this "heavy" feeling is this when I should use some method like..Rope, rollover..ect? I would like to walk around my house and see things in the astral, then..work up to projecting to other places. [

Hey Nay,
<br>
I'm now just reading the book of Oliver Fox. He describes what happens when he projects. On one point he reaches a trance condition and gets astral sight. Then he just wills himself out. Also in the book of Seth it is sugested to will yourself out in a quick motion, once you reach that state. Maybe you can give it a try.

Frank, I will start crackin' on my practices then.
<br>
<br>
I too used to open my physical eyes during lucid dreams trying to look at something and that would wake me up of course. Sometimes, I would be staring at something that I couldn't figure out what it was, like white mountains or gray fuzzy stuff in my dream...sure enough, it was my pillow or sheets! lol

Thanks again for the help,

  During the dream state, you are going into other dimensions other than the physical reality we know here on this planet.  There is no such thing as getting lost in your body when you have an out of body experience, because you are always connected with your physical self.  Most of the books out there are close to or say similar things, but are not targeting one real approach that sums it all up.  Read "Seth Speaks" The Validity of the Soul by Jane Robberts.  It is an excellent book and goes far beyond any books you will ever read.  This book is about a woman, Jane that was contacted by a personality in another dimension named Seth, and spoke through Jane to help people realize why we are really here on this earth, and that we know far more than we think we do by accessing our inner senses than the physical senses that we do know and use on a day to day basis on this planet.  It also talks about the dream state, and that when we dream we are really awake and when we are awake we are really dreaming, and that when we dream we tap into other dimensions, other realities.

Hi Amber,
<br>
<br>
Its the same with my subjects in hypnosis, each person is different under hypnosis even though their doing the hypnosis I just guide them and Instruct them but each one gos into it differently.
<br>
<br>
The same with Astral Projection you give the basic idea of how to do it and that individual will follow the same instructions but he will go into AP differently.  Generally the is a basic technique that everyone uses, but there is a percent of people that it won't work so the technique has to change a little so the person can AP.
<br>
<br>
Its the same with Medications a person can take one medication and it will work great and fast while another person may have to get another type of Medication or you have to adjust the medication so both people will reach their goal.
<br>
<br>
Thats why there are quiet a few techniques to go by.
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Frank (hypnotist)

<section>
The best way to OBE is to find your own technique that suits you the best. Vary on the many techniques out there as much as possible until you find, via trial and error, the perfect method for you. We are all different. Its all a matter of practice, practice, practice. And the discipline to keep at it.
<br>
<br>
Maybe the first step for all begginers should be to work on your self discipline skills, and then go for the OBE.

<section>
Amber, the technique you mentioned is the same technique that I have been doing lately.... I dont really do it consciously but I know thats what I do.
<br>
<br>
I can describe it as, actually gaining some consciousness during a dream, and then I slowly start waking up, and then next thing I know I consciously get up, and split from my body.
<br>
<br>
Ive never had a fully conscious OBE. That is what I am trying to acheive but. The technique you mentioned, when I do it, takes me into a more dreamy kind of projection. It kind of feels like a dream, but I am in my body. Everything isn't so clear.
<br>
<br>
I have read that a fully conscious OBE is more clear and vivid that real life even!
