Hello:
<br>
<br>
The problem is your mother will have to disengage eventually, no matter what. My advice is to accept the current situation and make sure you say everything you need to say to her before she leaves this current physical. Take it from me, there is nothing worse than having someone leave you totally unexpectedly. It makes you think of all the things you wanted to say to them but didn't. It's a question of realising the value in the moment, and all that. These situations really bring it home.
<br>
<br>
I wish you all the best.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey man...
<br>
<br>
One of the most powerful things you can do is to
<b>
 love
</b>
her with all your heart. In her
<i>
 higher self
</i>
it may be her desire and path to leave this plane now or soon coming. To wish her to stay may be a hinderance. Perhaps she held on this long because she knows you want her to (The Reconnections/Robert Monroe).
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, she may wish to live, and this illness may be a result of some lesson she is learning- perhaps to learn a greater degree of self love (Orin/Sanaya Roman, Seth).
<br>
<br>
Thus I suggest you to love her with all your heart, surround her with your love. This will supply her with a high vibratory energy which she can use for whatever her higher purpose is. You can take time out of your day, even 10 minutes per day, and just meditate on loving her, cocooning her with your unconditional love and acceptance.
<br>
<br>
Physical bodies are just tools. If she has done what she needs to do, it will hinder her to stay. If she has not done what she needs to do totally, and living is her higher purpose, she will recover no matter who says or does what. If you supply her with love and acceptance- unconditionally, untainted with your desire for something to happen, loving her for who she is and for what choices she makes, accepting whatever path she chooses- you will help empower her to make her decision in peace. Thus if she must kick the shell, it will be a more peaceful and loving transition, and it will help alleviate any guilt at 'leaving you'. On the other hand, if her choice/path is to heal, thus her healing will be more smooth and joyous.
<br>
<br>
In
<i>
 Dare To Be Yourself
</i>
(Alen Cohen) a guy shared that he healed himself of AIDS, lukemia, and cancer by simply choosing to love- himself and others.
<br>
<br>
Love.

Cezyl: I'm pleased you brought up the "guilt" aspect. I was searching for the words to explain it yesterday but couldn't.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, Archdragon, what you perhaps have to come to terms with is your mother may well have reached the end of her time here and is choosing to move on. People do this in all manner of ways. They may choose a particular circumstance, for example the circumstance of an "incurable" disease for the purposes of their exit experience. Or they may choose a more dramatic exit. But, ultimately, each person chooses their mode and time of exit. Though I do very much realise that virtually all people, particularly people in western society, are not geared up mentally to accept this yet in an objective sense.
<br>
<br>
There are people who, for the purposes of their experience, choose to engage in a life-threatening circumstance and then decide to "recover" from it. There are all manner of reasons why, and all manner of circumstances where people choose to do this. Some people, for example, rather than choosing to manifest a disease, manifest a certain kind of "disability" and all manner of things besides.
<br>
<br>
What it all boils down to is, whether your mother "recovers" or not is entirely down to her. She may well want to leave. In which case it is time for you to say what you need to say, and "allow" her to move on. This is very important.
<br>
<br>
Realise, there is no death. Your mother isn't "dying" your mother will always be. She is simply deciding to go home. None of us really live here. It's just a place we all created for the purposes of our experience. Think of it like you go on holiday, and you stay temporarily in a place, have some different experiences for a while, then go home again. It looks very much like your mother has decided to go home now.
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>
Frank
