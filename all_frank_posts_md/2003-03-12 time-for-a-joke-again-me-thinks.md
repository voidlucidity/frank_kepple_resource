<br>
Billy-Joe and Betty-Sue get married, and Billy-Joe whisks her away to daddy's hunting-cabin in the woods for a romantic, nature honeymoon...
<br>
<br>
He carries her across the threshold and they both get into bed, at which point Betty-Sue whispers in his ear, "Here Billy-Joe, be gentle 'cos I ain't never been with a man b'fore."
<br>
<br>
"WHAT?" shouts Billy-Joe! At which his little bride softly shakes her head...
<br>
<br>
Billy-Joe jumps out of bed, grabs his clothes, and races out the door into his truck... drives down the mountain road... straight to his parents house... rushes inside screaming, "Hey Paw! Paw! Ged'up!!!" ...
<br>
<br>
Father rushes downstairs and gasps, "Billy-Joe, what'r doin' here?"
<br>
<br>
Billy-Joe, still breathing hard from his mad flight, gasps, "Well, Betty-Sue an'I was in cabin an she toll' me she ain't ever been with a man before.... so I rushed outta' there an' lit back 'ere... as quick as I could!"
<br>
<br>
His father grasps Billy-Joe's shoulder in reassurance, and says, "Son, Ya done the right thing.... If she ain't good'nuff fer her family, she shure as excrement ain't good'nuff fer ours!!"
<br>
<br>
Yours,

So if that were not chuckle enough...
<br>
<br>
A pregnant woman walked into a bank and lined up at the first available teller. Just at that moment, the bank was robbed and she was shot three times in the stomach. She was rushed to hospital and eventually survived.
<br>
<br>
As she left she asked the doctor about her baby. The doctor said, "Oh! You are going to have triplets. They are all fine but each one has a bullet lodged in its stomach. Don't worry, though, each bullet will eventually pass through their systems as a result of normal metabolism."
<br>
<br>
As time went by, the woman gave birth to three children, two girls and a boy.
<br>
<br>
Twelve years later, one of the girls came up to her mother and said, "Mom, I've done a very weird thing!"
<br>
<br>
Her mother asked what happened. The daughter replied, "I passed a bullet into the toilet." The woman comforted her and explained all about the incident at the bank.
<br>
<br>
A few weeks later, her other daughter came up to her in tears screaming, "Mommy, mommy I've done a very bad thing!" The mother said, "Let me guess, you passed a bullet into the toilet, right?"
<br>
<br>
The daughter looked through her teary eyes and said, "Yes, how did you know?"
<br>
<br>
She comforted her child and again explained about the incident at the bank.
<br>
<br>
About a month later the boy came up and said, "Mommy, I've done a very bad thing!"
<br>
<br>
"You passed a bullet into the toilet, right?"
<br>
<br>
"No, I was masturbating and shot the cat."
<br>
<br>
Yours,
