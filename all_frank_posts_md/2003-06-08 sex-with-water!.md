<section>
Today, actualyl a few hours ago, I had sex with water, in a bath-tub.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now dont take it the wrong way, I dont have a fetish for water, and I didnt masturbate while taking a bath.
<br>
<br>
This was very energy involved, it wasnt the "physical" act of sex, but it was very .... emotionally, spiritually metaphysically etc like it.(not that I know what actual sex feel  like haha)
<br>
<br>
Its realyl hard to describe it, but I suggest all of you try it out, its extremely pleasureable. I almost passed out, and after we were finished I couldnt even stand up or anything. I was completely tired.
<br>
<br>
I didnt ejaculate or anything either, but it was one, if not THE best orgasm ever.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The best "tips" I can give is to like, not let your ego try to tell you how to do it. When I started doing it I was like "hmm I should try this blah blah blah" and thinking about it didnt make it any better.
<br>
<br>
Just do what feels right, and react to how the water acts and reacts.
<br>
<br>
I was probably pretty lame at it, from the waters perspective, but Ill definitely try it again and see if I get better. (that is, im going to get better at letting go of my ego, and basic conseptions about sex)
<br>
<br>
so, have fun, and enjoy this interesting thing I did today

Okay...from the sounds of it you might have had sex with the water spirit, or maybe you were making waves in the bath that made you horny[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
].
<br>
<br>
And if you don't know what sex feels like - I'm guessing you must be in the teens, particularly the lower teens I'm guessing because you don't seem to be describing much of what you did (not that I'm saying many people want to hear it[B)])
<br>

Well whatever man - sounds wierd to me.[xx(]

Uhh just a question...Is it possible to develop a fetish for spirits? I mean, fetish for water? Perhaps - but I think you might be gettin a lil' obsessed[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>

<br>
<br>
Be careful with the tantric sex thing - incubi aren't nice spirits, although they make you think so[

Gosh, that takes me back. I was so horny at 15 I'd have had sex with a hedgehog. Bath of water, nah, that's way too tame for me. And you

masturbate while taking a bath. What are you guy, a trainee monk or something?

You may be onto something... I've often thought of having my way with the bathtub, in fact I have a stash of "Bath &amp; Shower" magazines under the bed for those lonely nights. Since I prefer larger women, I went down to the local swim centre and had relations with the indoor 25m, the outdoor 50m, and the spa. Matter of fact, this cute glass of water on my desk has been making passes at me all evening... would it be rude to pour it down my pants on the first date?
<br>
<br>
Seriously friend, you may want to consider that water is used energetically and magically to disperse or discharge, both humans and objects, of pranic and astral matter. It is good at this, especially at lower temperatures. If you form a habit of sexual discharge into water, especially of the intensity you describe, you will find yourself depleted very effectively. The water will also contain your own matter very strongly, and the subsequent fate of the water will have an energetic recourse on yourself, even if you are not developed enough to sense it. This includes drainage, mixture with sewerage, etc. Many common techniques of voodoo and low magic utilise this fact, and someone sufficiently trained would have a very strong psychic link to you through that water. Negative recourse would be weak, given the dilution, and may not manifest immediately, but over time anyone with etheric sight could perceive the effect on your energy body through this habit. My advice, sincerely, is to discontinue the practice.
<br>
<br>
And please forgive the course humour above - only meant light-heartedly.

<section>
Man!  This post reminds me of my weekend.  Seriously, someone gave me a gift certificate for a "float session" at the local spa.  The float tank is filled a few inches with very heavily salted water so you float.  The tank is soundproofed and totally dark.  It's supposed to be a very peaceful experience.
<br>
<br>
I thought, great!  I'll meditate!  Maybe I'll even OBE!  No such luck.  It was such a sexual experience I couldn't even think straight.  When I got out of the tank, my legs were shaking.
<br>
<br>
No orgasm though.  I've still got salt coming out of my ears from this experience, and it keeps on reminding me.  I have mixed feelings about trying it again.
<br>
<br>
I don't pretend to know what happened.  All I suggest is, don't get too freaked out about it, but on the other hand, don't go looking for it either, especially since you don't know who/what is bringing on the experience.  You could find yourself enslaved to someone/something.  As a young person without other sexual outlets, you are pretty vulnerable.  Don't let it/her take advantage of it.

<section>
Wow.. the replys were so funny -
<br>
I wonder if someone would do "it" with a air elemental would ever have an orgasm - i mean the elemental would blow and blow and blow but he(tantric happy person) will never get an orgasm
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
))) LOL ROTFL
<br>
<br>
For a better experience here is what i think you should do:(experience elemental sex with two elementals: air and water)
<br>
You should wait for a storm - the bigger the better - this could take a while - if you see some signs - get outside and wait for the wind to start (air elemental) after that take off your pants (don`t worry about people seeing you - they do this all the time) and you know.. do what you usually do - don`t worry avout the water elemental this time - she(it) should be more gentle
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
- and don`t worry about not having liquid (usually the water elemental swalows it)...
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
)))) LOOOOOOOOOOL

<section>
hahaha, man you people are funny
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
!
<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway, like i said, it wasnt physical sexuality, it as like energetic stuff.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tisha, it wasnt a "taking advantage of"  if anything I was taking advantge of the water. I didnt really know wtf I was doing, and the water was a pro
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13,  haha, if you like them bath and shower magazines, you should definitely get issue number 27, of november 1999, they are displaying the new meon jet stream hot tubs, very nice !
<br>
<br>
anyway, I know what you mean about feeling others eenrgies in water, when i was doing it, i could like feel all the history of the people who water has been with, and all of the energy it has soaked up, etc.
<br>
<br>
Also, the waters energy was filled with sexual charge, not just from me, but from generations ago, it was really "experienced," so I doubt i am the firt or the last to try this.
<br>
<br>
About the psychic link to me through water, im not really worried about that because the water contained so many other peoples energies, and why would somebody just randomly try to harm me? My intent witht he water was positive, and I think anybody who would take the tiem to feel the water would realize my intent and therefore any negative consequences wouldnt happen?
<br>
<br>
Heck, intent is contaigious, and im hoping they catch my positiveness
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the water sex thing was something that was partly my initiation. Ive been feeling very sexual energy lately and I was sitting htere in my bath tub, and meditated for a little bit (just blank mind meditation) and then I laid back in hte bathtub, and the water was like energetic feeling.
<br>
<br>
and so hen i just started feelings its sexual energy, and sending it my sexual energy, and like by the time we were done  i was vibrating and like my skin was tingeling increbily crazy, the bottom of my feet, and my hands were like going crazy wiht electricity or something, and i was having all sorts of sensations shooting around my body.
<br>
<br>
then, it was like, i wasnt in my body anymore, i couldnt realyl feel my body as you normally feel it, it was like i could only feel my energy body and i could feel hte water playing with me(me = energy body)
<br>
<br>
but by then i was so worn out from doing it, i was like about to pass out.
<br>
<br>
so then i just sat there and let water massage me with energy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tao, actually its funny you mention the air thing, because air was involved in it too.
<br>
<br>
it was like a threesome with me and water and air, but i didnt mention air because it didnt do as much as the water did. Me and water started, then air joined, then air sorta played aroudna bit, then me ans water got it on hardcore.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I dunno though, in conclusion, i was planning on trying it again, just to see more what its like.
<br>
<br>
I feel pretty safe about it, i doubt its some sort of evil spirit, or its going to possess me because of my weak mind and teenage hornyness
