Hi,
<br>
<br>
I've read Mr. Bruce's description of stimulating the major chakras as a prep for OBEs, in his Treatise document.
<br>
<br>
However, the NEW pdf seems to say that stimulating the major chakras is not the right way to go.
<br>
<br>
In the short term, I wanted to increase my chances of having an OBE, but I didn't want to go in the wrong direction, per the energy work.
<br>
<br>
Any recommendations?
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>
<br>
Peter Brown

The thing is you can take any approach that suits. Bob Bruce offers a number of approaches none of which are in direct "contradiction" to each other. Even though it may seem that way. But at first it really is a case of whatever works for you is the best way (for you). Once you get proficient at doing it one way, then maybe you will want to chop and change and experiment a little.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Dear Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your reply. On page 4 of the NEW pdf doc, it states:
<br>
<br>
"Primary energy centre work should never be undertaken too vigorously, or at too early a stage of development. To avoid most potential problems, and before any primary centres are worked upon, supporting structures need to be developed, nurtured and conditioned to handle a greater flow of energy."
<br>
<br>
It goes into more detail in the paragraphs before and after that, but it seems to say quite strongly that one should avoid major chakra work.
<br>
<br>
However, in the Treatise on OBEs it suggests working with the major chakras right away.
<br>
<br>
I realize that there's more than one way to do things, but the warnings on page 4 of the NEW doc seem pretty strong.
<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
Peter

I have the same question.  I've been following the information given in the "Treatise" (pulling energy up from the feet and opening each major chakra in turn) and now I'm wondering why there is no mention of working on the secondary chakras first.

It's progressive. Build a solid, flexible foundation by working on the secondary system for a while first. Suggested was a time period of several months but this can vary quite widely-for instance if you have chi  kung training or worked as a healer before etc.  Basically once you have a solid foundation, primary centre work becomes easier, faster, more stable and safer. and more productive as you will be intimately familiar with the actions you are using.
