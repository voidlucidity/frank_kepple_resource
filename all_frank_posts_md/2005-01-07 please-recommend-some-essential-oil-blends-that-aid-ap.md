Hi,
<br>
<br>
I use essential oils quite regularly... although more for skin treatment, bathing, deep relaxation and meditation.
<br>
<br>
I can't say that any have made a difference to OBE success or not, but here are some brief observations off the top of my head.
<br>
<br>
Normally I use a water base for the diffuser rather than a direct heat aromatherapy lamp and around ½ doz drops for single oil and 3-4 drops of each for mixtures (dependent on the strength of the oil).
<br>
<br>
Lavender – in small quantities – I find that over use or too high a concentration leads to fuzzy thinking and sleep! Just a few drops – perhaps mixed with more stimulating oil e.g. lemon, orange, Neroli etc.
<br>
<br>
I would not tend to use oils like Eucalyptus or tea tree for this sort of practice.
<br>
<br>
I have used both oil and gum/resin variants of Frankincense and myrrh to good effect, but more for deeper soul connection meditation/attunement rather than OBE
<br>
<br>
I have tried Spikenard oil a couple of times during a shared meditation. Be warned this is a very powerful essence and equally expensive. Use it for special occasions... good for very deep heart/soul work.
<br>
<br>
As goes with the name I find Clary Sage – good for clairvoyance and spirit communication... and it has helped with OBE. However I would tend to advise moderate use.
<br>
<br>
Same goes with Geranium... this can be a bit strong, so please be judicious with the amount you use.
<br>
<br>
I find Sandalwood is clearing and balancing.
<br>
<br>
Pine seems good for clearing space – but if you don't like pine disinfectant then don't bother!
<br>
<br>
Rosemary – again good for clearing space
<br>
<br>
Patchouli – no effect for meditation for me anyhow
<br>
<br>
May Chang and Yang Yang - more for chill out or intimate times
<br>
<br>
Lemongrass – clearing and uplifting, but very strong so use in small quantities.
<br>
<br>
Clove - not for OBE or meditation work
<br>
<br>
Japanese oil of peppermint - Clearing, but very strong so use carefully.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

I've just become a new convert to essential oils, due to Stephen and Frank's posts.
<br>
<br>
I love the sound of Clary Sage, although I haven't a clue what it smells like (I guess it's like sage), and with regard to Sandalwood - it's one of my favourite smells.  Whenever I see a shower gel with the word "Sandalwood" on the front, I have to buy it, but I never knew it was available as an essential oil.
<br>
<br>
Luckily, this weekend, we are visiting my bro-in-law's health shop "up north", so that's two things on the shopping list so far...!
<br>
<br>
I doubt I'll be buying clove - the smell reminds me of visits to the dentist!!

I like Sandlewood, very powerful for me.  Very expensive also, but true essential oil makes regular incense smell like......something else.  I like cinnamon as well.
<br>
<br>
Try finding a good new age shop in your area, most have samplers you can smell at the store.  If it 'stinks there' it will stink at home

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Probably one of the best sources in the UK for essential oils etc are Amphora Aromatics try:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://amphora-aromatics.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://amphora-aromatics.com/
</a>
<br>
<br>
I believe they take international and bulk/trade orders as well.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
