<section>
Hello to all,
<br>
<br>
It´s the first time I write here. Excuse me because my english is not very good. I´ve never had any OBE, I am a sceptical person and I need powerful and logical reasons to believe in something. I would like to think that many of the things you say and believe are true. Really it would be wonderful, but I have serious doubts about it. Many of them sound to me like a form of self-deception. But I want make to you the following questions:
<br>
<br>
Do you really believe that an OBE or an astral projection erradicates absolutely the fear of the death? Have you acquired the absolute conviction that a man or woman is something more than his/her physical body and that can be possible the existence or an immortal part within us all? An astral projection can PROVE that definitively, without doubt?
<br>
If you have the ability of travelling out of your body to whatever place you want, could one of you, experimented travelers, for example come to my home and say to me how I am, what is the colour of my eyes, my hair, etc...?
<br>
<br>
Thank you.

No. But if you do the "card test" (the test where you try to see a playing card while "out of body") correctly and succeed, let's say, 5 times in a row, it'll heavily support some of the ideas.

Hi Basajaun
<br>
<br>
The fear of death question is interesting.  I have no fear of death, however I wasn't frightened of dying before I'd even heard of OBEs.  Just because you have OBEs doesn't necessarily mean you lose the fear.  You are still You.  It's not some massive revelation when you have your first projection (well, it wasn't for me anyway).  The fact that I perceive myself to be leaving my body and moving my conscious to another place doesn't mean all the jigsaw pieces fall into place and wham, bam, I know everything there is to know.
<br>
<br>
IMO, it's a very personal journey and your beliefs play a big part
<i>
 regardless of whether you can OBE or not
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I think you can only really prove astral projection to yourself, as I mention in the Playing Card Experiment FAQ.
<br>
<br>
So, I come to your home, I tell you that you have dark hair, hazel eyes, and a pimple on your chin.  What if I'm correct?  What do you do?  You won't believe me – you'll question me or you'll tell me I'm a lucky guesser – right?
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, you need to experience it yourself.  We are all unique, and speaking on behalf of those who can project, you will find we all have different beliefs about a whole variety of things, including the afterlife.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.
<br>
<br>
Sarah

Hi:
<br>
<br>
People who have never properly done it before always misunderstand the true nature of the process. They tend to come up with statements like, "If this, then surely you'd be able to do that," etc. There are difficulties to be encountered in all ventures. One day people will no doubt be able to nip here and there "out of body". But it's not quite so simple as it sounds. What you need to do is give it a try and you'll see what I mean.
<br>
<br>
In a way it's like saying to someone, but if you can drive a car then surely you'd be able to take a Formula 1 car around a track no problem? You can fly a microlight, surely you should be able to take off in a Jumbo Jet and land without difficulty?
<br>
<br>
You say it yourself in your opening statement, "I've never had an OBE..." Well, there you go. Get some practice under your belt and all your opening questions will be answered.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

No, not at all. Don´t worry about that.

You might as well not even try if you dont believe. Otherwise you will be in a constant state of trying to prove something to yourself, and you will never get anywhere.
<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is keep an OPEN mind, forget about everything you have learned in the past, and when you practice just be curious, dont question everything that happens.
<br>

I think everyone has given great replies to your questions. However, I think you must have some sort of belief in OBE otherwise you would never joined this group.                                                                                                     I am 37 years old, I have AP/OBE for the past 21 years. I never once tried to do it. It comes naturally to me. I believe there are many others out there like me.                                                                                                          I have no fear of death, because my first few experiences I thought I was dead. Imagine floating above your sleeping body. After thousands of experiences I know for a fact that we are much more than physical matter.                                                                                                    Before you can pass any sort of judgment on the subject you need to open this door and enter into it yourself. The Internet has opened windows for many different ways to experience these travels. I hope to hear that you have at least tried.

Basajaun:
<br>
<br>
Margin of error is the name of the game. But sceptics always demand 100% from everyone but themselves.
<br>
<br>
In the physical, if I asked you to turn a piece of solid bar down to exactly 6mm you couldn't do it. You'd have to work to a tolerance. Well, this is the same, there is no such thing as exact. Your questions are severely flawed, but to you they'll seem like moving pearls of wisdom, lol. But, then again, you have no experience. Which explains everything.
<br>
<br>
So my advice is for you to go and get some experience. Then come back and tell us what should and should not be possible. Until such time arises try to refrain from telling the knowledgeable people here what they should, or should not be able to do.
<br>
<br>
If you want to find out more then use the Search function or visit the FAQ forum. This should be pretty obvious to someone of your insight, surely. :)

I believe in the experience itself. I don´t deny that many people here has had an OBE, an AP or whatever name you want to call it. My doubts come next, with the purely subjective or objective nature of the experience. Is it all in my mind or really are we capable of going out of the body literally? In other words, my doubt is NOT about the existence of that experience, but about its objectivivity.

You´re wrong. The essential difference between a sceptical and a fanatic is this: the sceptical hasn´t a strong complex of megalomania. He is sceptical because is humble and humble because sceptical. He doesn´t see himself as an omnipotent wise. That is the reason of his doubts.

I think your questions are great and it is nice that u are trying to learn something here. But as others have already said--u should try to have your own experience. That is the ultimate proof. Until then nothing that u read or hear can really convince u.
<br>
<br>
I am practicing for several months already and have had some interesting experiences, I also read everything possible on the matter. It is a continuous journey, full of surprises and revelations. Learn to relax and meditate first, then try some techniques for AP (there are many books out there, as well as tons of info in this board). U  have to find your own way! Good luck!

If what you have learned blocks your view of what you CAN learn, this is a bad thing.

I would say for beginners the phasing method. Good results without alot of mumbo-jumbo. However, like anything it varies from person to person.  So explore everything. Another good aspect of the phasing method is that it does away with alot of the fears you might have about leaving the body, i.e. the vibes, sensations etc.

<section>
Your questions are valid Basajaun. But the only thing I can say to you is that if you're really interested in the subject, read as much about it as you possibly can. As you gain more outside knowledge, you will probably feel the desire to experience the things you've read about. Being unique individuals, different people are going to do better with different techniques. For me, Robert Bruces book Astral Dynamics, I'd say is perhaps the 2nd most influential book that I've ever read. The very day that I started using the NEW technique, I knew that I had stumbled onto something big. It was like a light had been flipped on in a previously dark room. It was like this book was destined to be in my life. Ever since then, I've had a clear understanding of the path I've needed to take.
<br>
<br>
Even still, Astral Dynamics represents only a piece of the puzzle. Other books have also helped me a great deal in piecing it all together. So read as much as you can. Pick-up books that you feel drawn to- let your intuition guide you. Then practice whatever techniques that you feel comfortable with. But be warned, it will often take a lot of diligence and persistence in order to get clear and definite results.

Hi Basajaun,
<br>
Welcome on the band-wagon. Your all doubts are perfectly valid and acceptable.

<br>
And now that you are feeling comfortable, I'll direct you to this thread for discussing the objectivity issues in AP -

<br>
<br>
Its my experience that majority of guys here are of your type, rational and open-minded, plus very creative. The 'I'm right-you're wrong' thing is tempting, but it saves time and bandwidth if one jumps straight on the subject, not on the people. You know 'the great minds discuss ideas' thing.
<br>
<br>
As far as the question of how to start is concerned, there is tons of info on it in this forum and on internet and in books. So there is no point in asking for help when everything is already served in front of you.

<br>
<br>
AP is a lot like a fun ride in a theme park initially, but to gain something useful from it is very difficult, its a lifetime business. There is some reason no-one on earth could prove its objectivity, given that so many civilizations lived and died without even doubting its existence. Perhaps this is the right time.

I agree. I think 100% accurate provable results are not only possible, but also very much needed. I don't think we should rest until this is achieved.
<br>
Damnit, the work is so painstaking though. Right now, I think I have touched upon the very basics of remote vision. If I look at my computer screen for instance, I can definitely see it move. I can make it magnify/shrink and even ripple, but only on a subtle level. With this I think I understand the very (
<i>
 very

) basics of moving my vision beyond what only my physical eyes can see. And objectively accurate results are what I'm after.

 For me, Robert Bruces book Astral Dynamics, I'd say is perhaps the 2nd most influential book that I've ever read.

Well, and what about "Mastering astral projection"? Is it a worse book than the one you have mentioned? Why did you begin your work with "Astral Dynamics"? And only by curiosity: What is the 1st most influential book that you´ve ever read?

 AP is a lot like a fun ride in a theme park initially, but to gain something useful from it is very difficult, its a lifetime business.

I don´t know exactly what are you trying to say, because there are persons in this forum that say that they have had an astral projection in less than six months. Then, could that be possible or not?
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your reasonable and kind answers.

Yes, thats possible. You can have it in days if you are lucky.
<br>
But it will take a long time and dedication to carry out useful experiments with it.
