I awoke this morning.  I lay in bed for a while relaxing and started to think about phasing.  I decided to "have a play" at it (nothing serious).  I imagined jumping up and down on a trampoline.  I really got into the sensation.  But I wasn't very good at replicating the actual jumps.  They seemed stuttered and not quite in time.
<br>
<br>
But I persevered and while I was jumping, I looked around the room.  After a short time, I realised I was jumping up and down properly on a trampoline.  For the briefest of seconds,
<b>
 I was there
</b>
.  The realisation jolted me back to F1.
<br>
<br>
This all took a matter of about 5 minutes!!  I didn't think it could be so easy.
<br>
<br>
Now all I've got to do is try and stop jolting back.
<br>
<br>
Hurrah!
<br>

Yay, well done! I think i must have sort of parts of me jolting to an astral plane and back again, once I imagined i was running for no apparent reason, i could see my room and all that, then i felt floor under my feet (although i was lying down) and so i kept running feeling it happen, lol then there was a lump in the ground feel flat over and brung my legs back to me haha.

Sarah:
<br>
<br>
An excellent experience that highlights a number of important issues.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, you say that you didn't think it could be so easy. Perhaps easy is not quite the word I should be using in my narrative, maybe "straightforward" would be more apt for the point I wish to make. Obviously it is going to be easier for some people more than others. But that doesn't change the straightforwardness of the whole thing.
<br>
<br>
For a while now I have steadfastly maintained that this whole issue has been unnecessarily complicated by layer upon layer of mystical crud that has infected this topic to the extent where there is no longer any cure. To me it's like a rampaging cancer where the only option left is to simply cut the whole thing out in order to try and get rid of it. When you do that, and you learn the basic structure of the wider reality, about how each person truly relates to that wider reality... everything becomes MUCH more straightforward!
<br>
<br>
The other important point your post exemplifies is the fact that the best mental rundown to make the switch from Focus 1 to Focus 2 of consciousness is simply the rundown that is the best for you. One of the most popular questions I get is,
<i>
 "Frank, what's the best rundown to use?"
</i>
Problem is, all the empirical evidence I have to date would strongly indicate that there is no universal "best".
<br>
<br>
There are, however, certain factors that stand out as being more beneficial than others.
<br>
<br>
I can say that what you need is something fairly simple and repetitive but interesting at the same time. If it's too repetitive then you'll get bored and either give up, or fall asleep. But make it too complicated and you'll lose the thread of it all. You need to engage your senses to as high a degree as possible, but make it personal and direct. Someone said the other week about engaging their hearing by imagining a bird singing in the distance. Well, that's a start but it's not really all that engaging. Why not play a drum? That way you get a sense of feeling, sound and sight... and it's
<i>
 direct
</i>
. All you need now is to chew some gum while you are doing it to get even your sense of taste involved and hey presto, you'll be making the switch before you know it.
<br>
<br>
Bouncing on a trampoline is ideal. Perhaps not everyone's thing but it's very engaging all the same. In other words it's a fun thing to do, it's a full on, in your face kind of activity and it directly engages the senses.
<br>
<br>
The other point I wished to stress I've just touched on in the paragraph above, which is the FUN aspect. I don't know what it is about all these mystical and other religious notions. To me it's almost like anyone wanting to take a more traditional course has to first have a total humour bypass in order to qualify.
<br>
<br>
Your rundown should be directly engaging and it also should be FUN. Not frivolous, and I want to stress this:
<i>
 we are not engaging in some frivolous act
</i>
. But it should be fun, all the same. But again I am doubly stressing because I don't want anyone getting the idea that we don't take any of this seriously. I, for one, take this topic very seriously. It has been a part of my life for over 20 years, so I take it seriously alright, but I also have fun while I'm doing it.
<br>
<br>
The other point you exemplify is the way people are typically jolted out of the state the moment they step into it. Often it is the case that you get jolted out of it so fast that you only really realise that you had made the transition to Focus 2
<i>
 after
</i>
you get jolted back to Focus 1. You are left lying there thinking back to a moment ago, realising you had stepped into your rundown and got zapped out of it. Normally the excitement of realising you made the switch prevents you from making any further attempts that session.
<br>
<br>
After a while of practice (actual time varies from person to person) you become comfortable with the process to the extent where you no longer get zapped out of it. Once you are comfortable in making the switch to Focus 2, then the next step is to learn how to transition to Focus 3 as that's where all the "fun stuff" is. The transition to Focus 3 is not all that difficult. But like the transition to Focus 2, it just takes a little practice.
<br>
<br>
Overall, it is not the actual doing that is difficult and your post is a perfect example of that even considering you are not exactly a complete beginner. I thing the most difficult aspect of this whole thing has been coming to the realisation of what the wider reality actually entails, rather than trying to sift through all the varying
<i>
 beliefs
</i>
about what the wider reality entails. Once you realise the structure and that there is a Focus 2, a Focus 3 and a Focus 4, and what you have to do in order to Phase to these areas (though everyone please let's put aside F4 for a while as it's mighty complex, we'll stick to F2 and F3 for now) then the actual doing isn't all that difficult.
<br>
<br>
Again, strip away all the mystical beliefs that have clouded the simplicity of it all and people will be Phasing for fun in no time. Well, that's what I sincerely hope.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
That's what I really like about this so far, the fun aspect. It's been a really good time for me.
<br>
<br>
It's neat to see what kind of things spontaneously capture all your attention and zap you in. The developing of the rundown has been very fun and relaxing for me.
<br>
<br>
Changing focuses is so much more basic than I ever thought ... and Sarah's example here is really spot-on from what I have experienced. Plus, keeping from getting zapped back from the realization or excitement isn't turning out to be as difficult as I would have imagined ... you just employ the same focus and indulging of the senses that got you there to begin with. It takes practice, but it's plenty of fun and education in the meantime.
<br>
<br>
The very notion of meeting up in FoC3 is thrilling - and, I feel, realistic. The reports from Sarah and others with their Phasing process has really kept me motivated and enthusiastic.
<br>
<br>
(BTW, I tried the trampoline myself, and I know what you mean about jumping being out of sync. It seemed that when I saw myself jumping from third-person it was in sync, but from first-person perspective, it seemed like I was always out of sync. Interesting ...

Thanks for the responses.
<br>
<br>
I had another go but used a different mental rundown.  I decided to play tennis.  It started well enough, but there was too much activity going on.  What with looking at the court/net/partner and jumping around with a racquet in my hand, I hadn't got the wherewithall to return the ball - my partner hit the thing so hard, I couldn't keep up with it!!
<br>
<br>
Playing tennis has potential because of the concentration and activity - but for me it was all too much.
<br>
<br>
I think I'll stick with bouncing, something not too taxing, but repetitive enough, and fun enough to keep me occupied.  And hopefully, with practice I can get my jumps in sync.
<br>
<br>
Strange, because the last time I was on a trampoline was probably when I was about 6 years old at Pontins in Blackpool.

Its funny you mention being out of sync while jumping. For some reason no matter how hard i concentrate i cant imagine myself walking. Now i dont use trampolines... ever.. but i walk alot and i find it strange that something as natural as walking can be hard to visualize, my arms are always out of sync etc.
<br>
<br>
Anyways break over, congrats on the experience sarah

This sounds just what Ive been looking for a realistic approach to experiencing other states of consciousness.  Franks phasing method is simple and easy to apply with a bit of fun thrown in as well.

Sarah:
<br>
<br>
Another great point that you exemplify. It's where I mentioned in my previous post,
<i>
 "If it's too repetitive then you'll get bored and either give up, or fall asleep.
 <b>
  But make it too complicated and you'll lose the thread of it all
 </b>
 ."
</i>
<br>
<br>
Your experience is typical of what happens when you make it too complicated for yourself. There is just too much to hold in mind and you lose the thread of it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi:
<br>
<br>
What I have tried to do is simplify the whole thing to get people rolling and experiencing what it is like
<i>
 consciously
</i>
entering another focus of attention along your consciousness continuum. Personally, I stop short of saying it is easy. I prefer the term straightforward. Because that's what I have tried to do, make it as straightforward as possible, so people can understand it. There is MUCH that I leave out that would only complicate things for beginners. For example, I put aside Focus 4 of consciousness more or less completely. If my experience is anything to go by, Focus 4 of consciousness is complex, mind blowing, totally freaky and at the same time can be highly amusing.
<br>
<br>
Experiencing my whole physical life as a concept was one of the most profound experiences I have ever had and changed my whole outlook on life literally overnight. So it's not for the unwary. You need to get a little experience under your belt first. Within Focus 4 you can experience anything you like
<i>
 as a concept
</i>
. You don't experience it objectively, you actually
<i>
 become
</i>
the concept. So you can actually become a musical note, or a colour. You can experience what it is like to be the colour blue, for example. One of the funniest experiences I've had is becoming the word "because". I could go on but it get's just too way out to explain with words. I doubt these experiences can be explained with words as we have no objective references to these kinds of highly subjective events. Major Tom touched on this recently when he was saying about how, in years to come, we'll have new words that specifically describe these experiences and we'll all know what we mean. And I'm sure that's how it will turn out.
<br>
<br>
The easiest transition to make is from Focus 1 to Focus 2 of consciousness. This is mainly because we communicate with Focus 2 of consciousness virtually continually without realising it. Our imagination and memory, for example, is located within Focus 2. So anytime you imagine or remember something you are accessing Focus 2 of consciousness. Our imagination is actually the very source of all that we create within the physical. Simply put, if you cannot imagine it then you cannot create it. It is no coincidence that successful people also tend to be highly creative individuals. If anyone wants to start changing their life then they have to start imagining differently to what they are doing now.
<br>
<br>
To me, it's like teaching someone to drive. I could go in all day about the intricacies surrounding the engine. Electronics and mechanics I know a lot about and I could harp on all day about the technicalities of the engine, the gearbox and the myriad of control systems. But that doesn't actually teach people how to drive. To do that what we need to do is sit the person in the driving seat, teach them how to switch it on, get it in gear, and start rolling forwards. It doesn't matter what all the switches are for, or what's under the bonnet, we just need to get rolling and we'll take it all step by step. And that's how I view projection. I need to get people consciously switching their attention to Focus 2. That's what gets you rolling.
<br>
<br>
Later on, if you want to do a bit of "energy work" for example, you'll find it a lot easier and more effective if you do it as an F2/F1 overlay experience within Focus 2 of consciousness. Anything you experience within Focus 1 you can also experience within Focus 2, only the effects are much more magnified within Focus 2. This can work against you if you subscribe to all the "neg" stuff. But for people following the Phasing Model we bypass all that fear-based stuff anyway, as all that tends to come about from the notion of "separation". With Phasing, it feels exactly like you were in your physical body only your environment changed. In other words, no scary sleep paralysis, vibrations or separation to scare you out of your wits.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I was bouncing again this morning.
<br>
<br>
I was going pretty well.  I'm getting to know the trampoline quite well
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
After about 10 minutes,
<i>
 something
</i>
happened, but I'm not quite sure what it was.
<br>
<br>
It wasn't that I was there (like last time), but something shifted somewhere and it felt distinctly odd.  For the briefest of seconds, I lost sense of everything it seemed, including what I was supposed to be doing.
<br>
<br>
Of course, as soon as I realised this, I was back to F1 faster than you can blink.
<br>
<br>
Progress, progress, progress.
<br>
<br>
Keep bouncing Sarah!

This is exactly what happened to me, i know what u mean by you felt odd, feels like theres a new type of energy.

Well ive noticed something too after 30 minutes of focus 2 the other day, I noticed something, im almost always in focus 2, all i have to do is thik and feel a certain thing at areas of my body and the physical side of it is no longer there.
