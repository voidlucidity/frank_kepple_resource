i herd that there are two spices that will keep you  more alert
<br>
<br>
but i am new at aping so i am not sure if they will allow you to AP or not but they are Cinnamon and peppermint they are supposedly good for long drives because they keep you more alert (but personally i think they would just make me more hungry
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
)
<br>
<br>
any way i am going to give them a try tonight and i will get back to you people tomorrow  if i any one has any Cinnamon and or peppermint it would be good just for sake of seeing if  the effects are the same that a few people try this soon
<br>
<br>
so that we have a more wide experiment but if nothing else i will try it tonight   and  i will keep you informed on my steps and the result as i tack this experiment in to my own hands  and if you do try it plz note what you do down to compare notes
<br>
<br>
i really want to see this work
<br>
<br>
thanks you all

OK it failed it  kept me too alert and i was not able to get to sleep  or even get close to a AP because when i stopped smelling the Cinnamon my body was so tired that it just shut it self down and i went directly to sleep  because all that was keeping me awake was the sent of the Cinnamon but  one  thing i can say is it does work to keep you awake until you stop smelling it
<br>
any way the procedures that i went through where as follows :
<br>
1)i got about a teaspoon of Cinnamon and put it in a bag
<br>
2)when i felt my self getting close to falling asleep but was not relaxed anofe to have a AP then i would smell the Cinnamon
<br>
3)redo  step 2 how ever many times it took to achieve a AP

Hi chrishill
<br>
<br>
Lavender is supposed to be good for making you sleepy.  So perhaps lavender first, followed by cinnamon/peppermint?
<br>
<br>
I find a couple of glasses of Merlot does the trick!  Sends me off like a baby, but because it's toxic, it wakes me up in the night, which enables me to (normally) have some sort of experience.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Sorry to be seeming to state the obvious but why don't you try when you are not so tired?
<br>
<br>
Yours,

So, what you do is put the cinnamon to your nose and take a whiff when you start feeling tired?
<br>
<br>
I think that's a problem.
<br>
<br>
You should move as little as little as possible when you're trying to AP.  Your body can't fall asleep very easily if you move it everytime it's about to fall asleep, can it?
<br>
<br>
Try just leaving the cinnamon right next to your nose... or anywhere where you can smell it enough to keep you awake, and try not to move this time.
<br>
<br>
If you can't fall asleep, maybe you could try staying up a few hours more before trying your experiment, so you're more tired.  If you're tired enough, your body will go to sleep no matter how much cinnamon you smell.
<br>
<br>
I might try this after about 30 hours without sleep.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your idea could work really well if cinnamon keeps the mind alert and doesn't keep the body from relaxing, but I'm not sure why cinnamon keeps someone awake.
<br>
<br>
Good luck, and thanks for sharing your idea, I might try it.

How about wrapping the cinnamon up in a cloth and tying it around your face? That way you could smell it without moving and your body would have a chance to fall asleep.
