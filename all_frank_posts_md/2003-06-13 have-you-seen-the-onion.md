Yes, I became familiar with it a while back (someone on campus was talking about it) and while it has some amazingly funny stuff, I can't get over how far to the left most of the writers are.  My whole thing is that I don't like extremists to far to the left or the right.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am going to go back and revisit it because it's been a while.  How did you find out about it?

Yes, Tisha, I read the site often. Political satire, humour-wise, is right up my street. I'm an avid reader too of the bi-weekly UK newspaper called Private Eye. It follows the same lines as The Onion only the slant is more UK.
<br>
<br>
Paragraphs such as:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "When you're in an army, you pretty much have to bomb the countries they tell you to bomb," Franks said. "Which is fine for a while. But eventually, you get tired of bombing the same old places again and again. The last thing I want is to be 70 years old, still bombing Iraq. It's important to keep things fresh."
</i>
<br>
<br>
Have me in stitches.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
