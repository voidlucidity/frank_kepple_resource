Well it appears i have been reading this forum for far to long without actually posting a thing! not even a hello and so i thought it best to say
<b>
 Hi
</b>
This place seems nice so I'll be sticking around, even if its just lurking and reading posts.
<br>
<br>

typical). I have no clue what else to put so i better cease my ramblings for now.
<br>
<br>
Take care x

Welcome, Rachel!  It is so much fun, and help, to just read all the posts.  I've learned so much, and feel like I've found a whole bunch of "kindred spirits"!
