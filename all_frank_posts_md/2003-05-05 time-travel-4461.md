<section>
one day after watching a movie about time travel(i don't rember what movie) i wondered is it possible to change time with a time machine and if it is it would be very hard.  this is because if you go back in tim eto change something then when time comes up to the present agian you would'ent make the time machine therefore you would'ent go back so you won't change the past.  And if this happens could'ent you create a never ending loop of different things happening in the same time period
<br>
<br>
p.s. this is on the theory that someone will oneday travel through time

That is called the paradox theory. The fact that if you went back in time to kill your grandmother it means you would never have been born but because you were never born you never went back in time to kill your grandmother so therefore nothing has changed, so you are back to were you were.
<br>
<br>
I did alot of research into time travel and from what our modern physics tells us, it shows that travelling into the future (in a sense) is possible. But i believe it is impossible to go back in time!!!
<br>
<br>
Time is based on speed!! (As Eintstein said "Time is relative") The slower we go the faster time goes, the faster we go the slower time goes.
<br>
This is of course in very minute ways
<br>
i mean you couldn't just walk very slow and that ment that time went faster it would only be going faster by like 1/10000000000000000 of a second.
<br>
<br>
But if we were ever able to travel at light speed or even faster then theoretically we could go forward in time. as the person in the spaceship would leave the earth at lightspeed and be in space for what it seems to them as 3 years and the astronaught will have aged only those 3 years.
<br>
While back on earth 20 years will have passed and people have aged etc....
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thos figures are just examples i dunno how much the real time dialation would be
<br>
<br>
There you go hope my info helped you under stand time a bit more

simkiller covered about everything i wouldve said.
<br>
<br>
whats interesting is that scientists are already trying to come up with ways to stop travelling at such speeds (the speed of light) from killing us, as we our body's cant take but so much speed. one of the more interesting ideas was to somehow make a sort of 'bubble of time' around a spacecraft and make the bubble with the spacecraft inside go the speed of light or whatever. this would theoretically keep the spacecraft intact because the space around it would still be in our normal sense of time, but i dont have any clue as to how theyre thinking about doing that.
<br>
<br>
doesnt anti-matter have something to do with travelling backwards in time? like matter as we know it is 'travelling forward' in time while anti-matter is 'going' the opposite way? if we could get generate enough energy to learn to harness anti-matter, that might be interesting, but we'd have to be anti-matter ourselves or else we might get ripped into atoms and then destroyed completely or something unhappy like that [

Antimatter is simply the exact opposite in characteristics to matter - where a proton has a positive charge, and anti-proton has a negative charge.
<br>
Antimatter exists, but as yet I do not believe it has any function relating to reverse time, as it still subject to the same laws of this universe as matter. Bring matter and antimatter together they will cancell each other out, along with cancelling out a great deal of everything else in the vicinity.
<br>
<br>
To create bubble in time you must also create a bubble in space. The old Star Trek idea of warp drive is exactly this - warping the space-time skein around an object.

LOL: I love toying around with ideas like these. Like, what happens if you go back to the time before your machine was invented? Or project to a time in the future after your machine broke down?

if time deals with speed could you go so slow that you would go back in time.

no, time just slows down

Time slows down as you approach the speed of light, so at some point time will either stop, or it will stop and then begin reversing - but that may not be the case, time is relative to a persons point of view, for a person on a spaceship approaching light speed time is not slowing down to them its still normal but from an outside observer time onboard the spaceship is slowing down.
<br>
At the end of the day this is all theoretical, the only way to know what will happen is if someone travels faster than light speed - problem with that though is the faster an object travels the more mass it aquires (the heavier it gets) therefore meaning that in order to push an object faster and faster more and more energy would be required which means that in order to reach the speed of light you would need 'infinate energy' which is why scientists say that it would be impossible to build something that can travel at the speed of light unless you can design a piece of technology that decreases an objects mass.

<section>
Time isn't related to speed as much as its related to distance. Time can neither be slowed down nor sped up. It just is. It is the perception and measurement of time  - chronology, that can be affected, not time itself.
<br>
<br>
The measurement of time is always based on an objects movement from point A to point B. For time to be percieved, something must travel a distance, be it an electron orbiting the nucleus of an atom, or our solar system orbiting the hub of our galaxy. This means that for time to exist, for anything to move any distance at all, everything must travel in a forward direction in time, as it is impossible for any object to travel a negative distance.
<br>
<br>
To be able to move around in time, as it seems possible to do in the astral, you would have to be completely disconnected from space. Even then you would have only changed your position relative to space, as you would be disconnecting from a point in time-space, and reconnecting at a point elswhere, either forward of your current position, or back. You yourself would still be moving in a forward direction in time no matter what point in time-space you reconnected yourself.
