hi everyone
<br>
<br>
I have had an experience of sew green skin organism when I had a child.  They are looking like as human but have green skin and a big mouth.  It was unusual ratio between the head and body.  Who has known the organism, please tell me.  I come from Hong Kong. Hope for your understand my English discussed.

Greetings Katrina,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum!  Your English is pretty good, I can understand you and that is the main thing!
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I can't help you with your green skinned organism.  I've never seen anything like that before myself.  You might want to try and post that in a different section, as you may get better results.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, once again, welcome!

I'm afraid I can't help you either with your strange experience.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, feel free to have a good look round and perhaps someone else will be able to help.

Thanks your attention! Yes! I like here because a lot of interesting topic. In the Chinese culture people can open talking mystic.  But I love to comprehend all mystic and ancient metaphysics! So I enjoy the forum let me satisfied to my curious.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I will still find out my green skin organism. They have not ghost or spirit and looking like as entity!  At the last two year, I was looking two books on the small topic to discuss some people saw the green skin organism in the USA. I believe that!

Thanks!  Jen!  Yes!  The pictures very similar my green organism, but have some different.  I remember the large eye isn't like a cat eyes.  Anyway I can't understand.  If they were lived underground bases on earth, so why not showed them for the human?
