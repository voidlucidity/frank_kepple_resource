Hello, my name is Jason I've been reading open-minded books for a couple years now and have goals of reaching financial freedom in the next 10 years so that I can spend my day working on spiritual development (meditation, tai chi, etc.) that would be an excellent life to me ! Â I'm still not very experienced with meditations ( I've been listening to a few guided ones) so any suggestions I would greatly appreciate.

Welcome and I hope you get what you wish for on your goals. I get a sense though that you think life gets easier when you can completely focus on spiritual development; prepare for that not to be the case.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
There is a wealth of information here, and I'm sure you'll find some topics that you'll want to participate in.
<br>
<br>
Meditation is something I do every day. It's very important as it has many benefits to you physiologically, and spiritually. Back in the 70's I did TM and moved to Zen Meditation while attending a local Soto Zen Center back in the 90's.
<br>
<br>
There is a great little book I would recommend (I'm a voracious reader myself) on Zen meditation. It is by a man named Robert Aitken and its entitled
<i>
 <b>
  Taking the Path of Zen
 </b>
</i>
. It is reasonably priced, around $10., and has a great introduction to zen meditation.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy the forum, We'll look forward to your participation here.
<br>
<br>
Nick
