I've posted in these forums a few times already, but haven't done the formal "hello" yet, so I am here to fix that.
<br>
<br>
I actually found this site a few months ago while looking for info on psychic self defense. I am attempting to correct some serious problems in my life, and develop myself spiritually at the same time. I really had no interest in OBEs or AP in the beginning, but I ordered MAP anyway, along with the psychic self defense book because I read somewhere that by mastering the techniques that are used to develop astral projection, you will strengthen your energy pathways, and subtle bodies.
<br>
<br>
A lot of things are starting to be exposed that I need to take more seriously in my life, but at the same time I have been having a great time reading other peoples posts and saying to myself "hey, the same thing happened to me!" and "Gee, I didn't know that had anything to do with astral projection!". I don't know if this makes me feel more "normal", or actually more insane, but it's fun anyway!

It helps to take my mind off the bad stuff that's going on in my life.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who is keeping this site running!

Hi Sparkwielder,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting the "hello" and welcome to you! One very special aspect of the Astral Pulse forums is that it is a global meeting place. It is, as you've pointed out, quite nice to see that others have had similar experiences. Also, it's a great place for trading information as well. We'll look forward to your continued participation.

Very best,
<br>
Nick
