The site looks like a place I have been wanting to find for a long time. Looks incredible. I have a few questions that maybe somebody can answer. When I registered today, I noticed that I cannot post/reply etc to topics. Can anybody explain this since the whole purpose for me getting here is for me to make connections and develop my OBE.

<br>
never mind...I guess it needed a few minutes to go thru.
