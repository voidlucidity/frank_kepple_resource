Well one thing I used to do which is quite typical is snore but I don't do it as much any more because I have lost weight.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing I used to do since a very young age is to make a huuummmmm sound, some ppl tell me I still do it sometimes. I guess I do it :p  I used to be able to wake up from it.  Actually my mom tells me that she used to do it to me so I could fell as sleep.  So every time at night I would be have awake I would do it subconsciously I guess.  Sometimes I would use it at night when I was unable to sleep and very soon I would sleep.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another very typical is talking in my sleep..I know a lot of people do this but does anyone know anything about it..Like why do you think it happens that we talk in our sleep... and how come you can have an actual conversation with a sleep talking person.  Do you just go directly to their subconscious?  My brother used to sleep talk and I would ask him questions and he would reply.. I know Greek and English so does my brother.. the funny part is after he went to the states he would sleep talk in English. Quite amazing isn't it.  To tell you the truth when I was in the states I started thinking in English so I dunno what happens with the way we think, it is just amazing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well the best thing I do while sleeping is
<b>
 LAUGH
</b>
!!! Yes you heard me right.  It is the most amazing thing.  I sometimes see things and I laugh in my sleep.  It is the most beautiful thing but I guess in times it can be rather annoying to others.. hehe. I love it now that I am thinking of it.  I do have woken up from it many times... I remember my poor roommate wondering wtf. is that guy doing.. hehe  (In general I laugh very much.. even at stupid jokes.. I just love laughing in my life and it makes me feel very good but even while sleeping I mean what the hell

) Does anyone know anything about this?
<br>
<br>
I would love to hear your thoughts.  Thanks.

I and my brother also laugh at sleep sometimes, but it's not frequent.
<br>
Why should it be annoying to others? When I see someone laughing when sleeping, I start to laugh too...
<br>
Also talking with sleeping or half awoken person is a great fun too.

Don't sleep on your back and you shouldn't snore =)
<br>
<br>
I don't know if I snore, but I never goto sleep on my back unless maybe I'm on a sofa taking a nap or something.
<br>
<br>
But if you move about in your sleep a lot then I don't think you can really prevent yourself from moving onto your back.

I sleep talk and I use to sleep walk. I might still sleep walk but I have been known to do some wackys things.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I would wake up from sleep walking but I would not be fully aware, and so I just kept doing whatever my mind was thinking at the time.

I am glad that other people have shared the feeling of laughing while sleeping.  I believe it is a very nice sensation

Hello:
<br>
<br>
The weirdest thing I ever did while asleep was go to take a pee (or so I thought) and fell down a flight of stairs, in a hotel I happened to be staying at once. Coming around, completely naked surrounded by a place full of strangers was an experience I will never forget. I worked out later that if I traced my steps exactly as if I had been at my own house I was then living at, the route was almost exact to the top step.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Aha! Frank sleeps nude!
<br>
<br>
I have woken from laughing too. It was usually from someone in my dream saying something so hilarious, which I felt was so clever that I could never have thought that on my own. I wondered if maybe the funny line really came from someone else, and it wasn't my own brain, or subconscious or whatever our dreams are.

I remember waking up crying once. I didn't record dreams at this time and I can't remember if I had tears or not.
<br>
<br>
Calling my daughter late one night recently, she was crying over the phone. She kept saying "I can't talk about it". The conversation ended without a goodbye. The next day I called her again. She explained she was asleep when I called her. Her cousin was there and knew she was asleep and turned her phone off for her. She thought it was funny the next day and was laughing about it.
<br>
<br>
My dog has always barked in his sleep. At night you can tell the bark is in sleep because the bark is at a low volume. Once he was on his side, you could tell he was dreaming. His front legs moved like he was running.
<br>
<br>
My daughter tells me I clinch and grind my teeth when I get disturbed from sleep during the night. She says she can't stand the sound of it and tries to make sure nothing wakes me up (when she's around).
