<section>
Hello folks!
<br>
<br>
First, I appologize for putting this message all over the
<br>
forum. But, it really is important enough for doing that.
<br>
I think you will find the below very interesting:
<br>
<br>
<br>
By using audio-technology, your brain can produce
<br>
large quantities of a given brainwave type. By sending
<br>
at tone of 200Hz into one ear, and a tone of 210 Hz
<br>
into the other ear, a part of your brain will start to
<br>
make 10 Hz brain waves, and then you whole brain will
<br>
start vibraiting in this pattern(among other, since
<br>
you have both beta, alpha, theta and delta frequency
<br>
in your brain, just of different amount).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Traditional meditators spend many hours a day in
<br>
many years, to be able to meditate in low delta. But,
<br>
using audio-technology, it is not your focusing that makes the
<br>
delta waves, but the stimulation from the sound technology!
<br>
You can even go deeper than zen-buddhist monks, but without the pracice! Traditional meditators are sceptic
<br>
to this possibility, but after trying it they are impressed!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Delta waves does something to you. It makes your brain
<br>
get more input than it can manage, which pushes your brain
<br>
to organize at a higher level. This development is very
<br>
beneficial, and makes you feel more one with the universe
<br>
(yes, it is a spiritutal development technology also),
<br>
makes you feel more content and happy, synchronizes your
<br>
brain, gives you more energy, increases mental ability,
<br>
clarity, intuition and psychic abilities, develops your energy body and more...
<br>
(Seems like a much easier way to develop your energy-body,
<br>
and can probably function as a great supplement to energy raising.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Centerpointe Research Institute was the first to discover the
<br>
importance of carrier frequency(if using 200Hz and 210Hz to
<br>
induce a 10 Hz brain wave state, then 200Hz is the carrier
<br>
frequency). Lowering carrier frequency increases input to the
<br>
brain. When the Centerpointe-people first started experimenting
<br>
with carrier frequency, they lowered the carrier frequency
<br>
substansially. At first they seemed to develop at very high
<br>
speed(which they kinda did), but after 5-6 days they got so
<br>
much input and physical, mentally and emotionally disturbance
<br>
that they were freaking out! The solution was to wait until
<br>
the brain had organized at a higher level with a certain carrier frequency, then lower the carrier frequency, wait until the brain
<br>
again had organized at higher level, then again lower the carrier
<br>
frequency, and so on. But from day one, you are in delta. The longer you stay in the program, the more you evolve(in fact, when getting longer into the program, people feels so great and has
<br>
achieved so much, that many continue the program just out of curiosity!),
<br>
but even in the beginning you evolve. I have used the program only for
<br>
a relatively small period of time, but have allready gone trough
<br>
positive changes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Centerpointe Research Insitute's Holosync Technology is the
<br>
best developing-program i have heard of, and if you would like
<br>
to read more about it and perhaps purchase it, I recommend that
<br>
you visit:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030528165839/http://www.centerpointe.com/" target="_blank">
 http://www.centerpointe.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you do buy it, you can mention my name, which is
<br>
"Tormod Krogh". If 10 people mention my name, I will
<br>
get my next level for free. You will not have to pay
<br>
more money by mentioning my name, but Centerpointe will
<br>
give the program to me as a "thank you" for telling people about the program. This wasn't my intention with
<br>
this message, which is to inform humans about this incredible
<br>
technology, but being a poor student, I(and my wallet)would
<br>
very much appreciate it if you mention my name "Tormod Krogh"
<br>
when perhaps buying the program, as a thanks for telling you about it!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Have fun!

<section>
I am very sorry!
<br>
The tile of my message, BREAKTROUGH TECHNOLOGY,
<br>
was misleading.
<br>
<br>
The start of this technology was in 1972, I think,
<br>
when a guy called Gerald Oster found out that when
<br>
you send one tone of one frequency into one ear and
<br>
another tone of another frequency into another ear
<br>
(located on the other side of your head), the brain
<br>
starts producing large quantities of brain waves
<br>
with a frequency of the difference between the 2
<br>
frequencies(210Hz and 200Hz makes 10 Hz). It starts
<br>
in the olivary nucleus and spreads so your whole brain
<br>
resonates.
<br>
<br>
Robert Monroe of the Institute of Applied Science experimented
<br>
much with this technology, and I understand it so, that one
<br>
thing he did with it, was to get into a deep brain wave pattern
<br>
so he could have an OBE. The Centerpointe approach was available
<br>
to the public, trough their Holosync-technology(which they
<br>
have improved; they have also improoved their litterature)in 1989.
<br>
The Centerpointe approach is, as far as i know, uniqe with
<br>
their system of lowering carrier frequency. If there exists
<br>
other organizations which sells this technology, i would be
<br>
happy to know, but Centerpointe was the first that used this
<br>
system of lowering the carrier frequency, and I doubt that any
<br>
organization has a more professional way of dealing with this
<br>
technology, or that the litterature they send you is better,
<br>
more informative, more enlightening.
<br>
<br>
There are alot of sound tecnology out there, but technology
<br>
which creates auditory beat patterns in the brain, probably is
<br>
the most important.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in superlearning or the Tomatis Method,
<br>
I can tell you that Centerpointe will send you CD's which
<br>
with you can superlearn and enjoy the effects of the Tomatis
<br>
Method(high frequency sounds, bla bla).
<br>
<br>
Once again: I am sorry for calling it breaktrough technology.
<br>
I realize that it was a stupid title(though, maybe effective).
<br>
But, the important was that you read the message.
<br>
I will stop scribling now.

Greetings noadrenaline.
<br>
<br>
I rather wish you hadn't posted this all over the forums, it's very annoying.

you need no technology, if you start depending on this junk, you're no better than a junkie

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
Parmenion:
<br>
Is the message annoying? Now, that is too abstract for me!
<br>
I would rather say that you got annoyed. Either way, you loose...
<br>
But, hopefully, it was a one-time-coinsidence. Still, I posted
<br>
it only in forums where it was logical to post it, and not
<br>
in places like "Integral Philosophy".
<br>
<br>
Mirador:
<br>
I'm not dependent on it, and it is only stimulation,
<br>
your brain does the whole thing. I don't think such
<br>
technology is unspiritual. I think it can accelerate
<br>
sprirtual development. It is not supposed to be used
<br>
forever, and when you are done with it, you can for
<br>
example meditate much better without the technology,
<br>
than you could, before you started using the technology.
<br>
Of course, there are many other benefits than this.
<br>
<br>
You don't need to close your eyes to relax, but it sure helps!
<br>
And what has happend is only this: a change of enviroment.
<br>
<br>
Have fun!

<section>
And my name is Noradrenalin, not NoradrenalinE.
<br>
Noradrenalin is the norweigan word for noradrenaline.
<br>
Maybe i should change it...Argh!

Nora: Perhaps try again using the word, irritating. Does that make it any more comprehensible for you?
