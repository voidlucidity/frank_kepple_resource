H All,
<br>
<br>
I started a dream journal last Saturday, and started doing reality checks regularly throughtout the day from Sunday.  Also at night, going to sleep, I have been saying repeatedly, ' I will remember to look at my hands'.
<br>
Tuesday night I had a dream, that I had been dreaming and had woken up and was filling in my dream diary. (If that makes sense). My bed was outside on the street under a tree (??) and some raindrops were falling off onto my diary and so washing away all I was trying to write.  Then I awoke for real.
<br>
Last night, I dreamt that I came to a brick wall and wanted to seelifted  over and I stepped on something and put my hands on top of wall and myself up. Just as I saw over the other side, which was kinda just light and dark shapes, couldn't make anything out at all, I fell backwards off wall, but instead of just crashing to the ground, I fell down real slowly kinda below the ground with a sinking feeling in my stomach, and was 'flying'. I shouted ' This is it '   then  'Look at your hands'     'Look at your hands' .
<br>
I kinda had to force my hands in front of my face, at first I could not see anything, then slowly hands came into view but just silvery/white hands, not real looking. They did not melt, they just looked strange.
<br>
Then  it really began, my chest started  (vibrating is not the right word),  buzzing is the closest I can get to it and my face felt like a strong wind was blowing on it, my arms and legs tingled. At one stage it got quite strong, but then it all just died away. I was not scared/frightened, in fact it was thoroughly enjoyable and I felt sad when it ended. I did not wake up for real at that moment, it was like I had been dreaming about dreaming again,  cos I 'woke up'  sat in a chair and feeling sad.  Then I woke up for real.
<br>
Sorry if this is confusing but it is difficult to recount  dreams about dreams in a logical way.
<br>
My question is, were these Lucid Dreams, an attempted OBE, or was my subconscious mind just giving me experiences I wanted/expected to have, after all the reading and things I have been doing this week.
<br>
I don't know. Is it a positive sign of things to come.  ??  I hope this is the right answer.
<br>
Thanks for listening to my rambles, hope they make sense.   lol

Hi Pete,
<br>
<br>
A couple nights ago I was having a dream about a friend, we were talking about his car or something, and I showed him how I could float backwards (on my back, a few feet off the ground) through a doorway. I could 'feel' the sensation of doing it.
<br>
<br>
This morning I was dreaming (don't know what) and suddenly, very clearly I heard one of the participants (I won't say who, I'm waiting to see if this person posts this morning - hee hee) from this forum saying "I have to tell them that I had an OBE....'
<br>
<br>
I looked at my hands in a dream a while ago and they melted.....but I thought I was dreaming; I separately looked at my hands while projecting, and they looked weird but didn't melt....
<br>
<br>
etc ...
<br>
<br>
In my opinion all these sorts of things increase when you are bringing more conscious awareness to your dreams. In my opinion even (far) more convincing experiences also happen as you do this. I can only speak on the basis of my experience and what I have read - but I think that everything doesn't fit neatly into dream/lucid dream/obe.  I think it is more that as you are more aware and conscious of this part of your mental processes, you have more of ALL of these sorts of things happen.
<br>
<br>
So yes, I'd personally say it's a good sign, it means you are bringing more consciousness to your sleep state. My personal framework for thinking about these is different from Robert's, and I think we each have our own little ideas about what might be going on. So someone else might have a different idea about what your experiences represent.

What you experienced was your sense of conscious awareness coming awake within a dream. This naturally makes you more lucid, hence the term lucid dream. Plus, you can also begin to perceive vibrations of varying degrees, which is perfectly normal.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do now is work on developing a more controlled sense of conscious awareness.
<br>
<br>
Basically, if you perceive your consciousness at a place other than firmly seated within your physical body, then you have had an "out of body experience". Problem is, people often confuse having an out of body experience with controlled astral projection. But the two are *widly* different.
<br>
<br>
The first thing you need to keep in check are your emotions. Which is easy to say, but is very tricky to do at the time. Any emotional release will create the circumstances that surround you, and you will enter what I call a Buffer Experience.
<br>
<br>
You have already experienced an example of this where you say,
<i>
 "I was not scared/frightened, in fact it was thoroughly enjoyable and I felt sad when it ended.
</i>
[Now enter buffer experience and feel justification for releasing emotion of sadness]
<i>
 I did not wake up for real at that moment, it was like I had been dreaming about dreaming again, cos I 'woke up' sat in a chair and feeling sad.
</i>
<br>
<br>
You will see my note in square brackets, that's the point where you entered the buffer experience fuelled by releasing feelings of sadness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Controlled, conscious-exit Astral Projection is difficult to achieve. Naturally, there will be those that pick things up quicker than others. But from what I have come across so far, from articles and posts I read on the Internet, what a lot of people are calling Astral Projection is largely their own emotional interplay.
