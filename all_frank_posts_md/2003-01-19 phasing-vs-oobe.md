well people have been talking a lot about the difference between phasing and oobe. my question is, have you guys found one to be easier than the other? Would you recommend one method to a beginner as opposed to the other one?

Several times I read here on the forums that for people like me who have trouble getting out of body in the traditional way, phasing is a good way to explore the astral planes. I have considered this and decided not to do it because it would be too much like giving up. Then again, it seems like it is common to meet spirits during phasing and to be able to assist them in moving on when they are stuck in an unpleasant situation on the astral. It sounds like people start to meet spirits and interact with them very soon after learning phasing, and in the process their own development / evolution speeds up.

I heard somewhere that phasing lets you go through walls and stuff.

That is a different sort of phasing than the one discussed here. There are a couple of items on that kind of phasing, going through walls physically. The same articles say it is very painful. See

for details in the articles section.

As to whether one is easier than the other I think, to a large degree, depends on the individual in question. The one big problem with traditional obe experiences is nothing can prepare you for the shock of actually being "out of body". Not that you are really "out" of your body but that is how the mind tends to see it. Which is very disconcerting to say the least. Not only that, you have to be prepared to endure some very freaky bodily sensations which take a LOT of getting used to.
<br>
<br>
For example, it's all very well
<i>
 talking
</i>
about flying through Grid Formations and Astral Plane Entrance Structures, and seeing pretty pictures of them in a book... but it's quite another thing actually
<i>
 doing
</i>
it.
<br>
<br>
With me I can actually feel the energy of these structures which often gives me near constant feeling of having an electric shock. Plus, there are zillions of other sporadic buzzing and crackling sensations like you get on the Physical from static electricity. None of this is harmful in the sense that it causes any pain. But again it all takes a LOT of getting used to. The moment you feel a crackle you immediately think: OUCH! Not that it did really hurt, but that's the way the mind keeps reacting to it.
<br>
<br>
With Phasing, none of these sensations come about. When performed correctly it should just give you a feeling of one smooth transition - through various states of feeling - from Physical to Astral. In other words, there is never any feeling of being "out of body". It just feels like you are you, in the same body, only your surroundings changed.
