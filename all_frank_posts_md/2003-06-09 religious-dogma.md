Hi everybody.
<br>
<br>
Today I was watching a video on faith healers in religious studies (random thought - I dreamt of this last night[B)]) and there was pretty amazing stuff in there. Until the end of the lesson, where I got incredibly peeved off.
<br>
<br>
The attention of the video turned to one priest. This guy started his healing session by having a religious rant. The rant discriminated against EVERYTHING here on the astral pulse, and more. He said "HOMOSEXUALS will NOT enter the kingdom of Heaven! That includes active homosexuals and inactive homosexuals! Using the back passage for sex is WRONG and is not favoured by God! The Holy Spirit disproves of homosexuality and you must repent against your evil ways!"
<br>
<br>
He then went on about how martial arts and Yoga were worshipping false Gods and thus people who practised such things were to be damned by God and sent to Hell forever unless they repent. Now say that again? Yes that's right. I practice Yoga to some extent and I know that it doesn't worship any god or gods whatsoever. It is a meditation and chakra development system.
<br>
<br>
Then he started ranting about witchcrafts such as New Age groups and crystal healers and healing that is not in the name of God such as Reiki. He also ranted about astrology and the horoscope, claiming they worshipped Satan, when in the story of the three wise men evidence points to the fact that the horoscope and astrology were how they found out Jesus was born. Correct me if I'm wrong. Astral projection and lucid dreaming fits nicely into the New Age group, don't you think?
<br>
<br>
So much for Christians being such great people. After I saw this I was sort of anti-Christian, but tried not to be. Now I'm just sick of fanatics of any religion. Christian fanatics, no offense, would possibly the worst. This guy was an example of one. They go on about how great they are and how humble it is to be Christian when they are constantly telling people how to do things and telling other religions that they are full of s@#* and only they are right. I know other religions do the same thing but honestly I haven't seen a more disgusting display of contradictory and boasting ever in any other religion.
<br>
<br>
I am not saying that Christians are bad. I am not saying that anybody here is a fanatic, and I'm not saying that fanatics are all lunatics that should be locked up. I'm talking about these bozos who run around trying to control people through religion. Al Qaida's(sp?) terrorist network is another example.
<br>
<br>
I believe there is a higher power, but I don't believe that the way that so many religions practice worship is wholly right. Sure, there are many MANY good priests etc., but honestly that kind of rant from this guy should NOT be tolerated.
<br>
<br>
I appologise if I am discriminating against anybody, I just really really hate idiots who run around doing that sort of thing. I mean, according to THOSE guys, I can't even take a dump without bowing down and crying my tears out begging for forgiveness for my horrible sin.
<br>
<br>
The point of this post? No idea. Thought I'd raise the topic[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
]. Hey, what can I say - it was on my mind.

Im going to read a bok written by a christian, its called "The screwtape letters" or somehting like that, by CS L(or SC?) LEwis   lol, I  think you should read that book too and notice how what that dude says, and htink about how it corresponds directly to all of the yoga/blah stuff here.
<br>
<br>
Most christians are pretty "physical world" and therefore d not see that in reality they are worshipping the same thing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
also, the bible is misenterpretted WAY too much by egotistical novice preachers who dcouldnt care less about divinity, but go to church as a way to parade their ego's and communicate with otehr people socially.
<br>

I have typed this post completely blind, so sorry for any spelling erros, etc.

Hello FAT Turkey [

I didn't have a religious upbringing  but at around 20yrs old had a spiritual encounter with the Holy Spirit. It was real and profound for me. The problem is for me when  man comes into the equation and adds rules and ideals acording to there interpretation of the Bible. The Church I was attending had very strict ideals on everything, obey or be dammed  kind of thing. I still believe in God and I cannot deny the spiritual experience with the Holy Spirit, it's just sad how ppl misuse, corrupt and  try to take control all in the name of God.

I really can't stand those types of religious people.  They label what they personally disagree with as evil and in their minds their religion is the only right one so anything even remotely disagreeing with it must be something of the devil.

Personally, FT, I find it ever so difficult to try and work out where these people are coming from. Do they truly have next to no real experience with what
<u>
 actually
</u>
goes on within non-physical realms?
<br>
<br>
On the surface it would appear they do not. However, they must have been non-physical before their current physical life and actually chosen to do what they do now... but why?
<br>
<br>
What is it they are trying to work out of their system?
<br>
<br>
Guilt?
<br>
Fear?
<br>
Hate?
<br>
Rage?
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, it sure isn't empathy.

Yep, definitely sounds like a fanatic to me. I am Christian but understand that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to reality. Unfortunately many Christians have fear when it comes to this metaphysical stuff because they fear it's Satan deceiving them, (which is understandable because the Bible warns that Satan is the master of lies), but a lot are too closed minded to be open to the possibility that not EVERYTHING they place into the "new age" category is evil. I believe some things are not to be messed with, but some are of the Holy Spirit or simply natural altered states of consciousness and are safe.

I think God sent them down to give the rest of us something to laugh at [
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
]   Seriously, if you believe in the theory that we choose all of our lives (whether one or thousands), then this person's soul just gave itself one tall order.   [:O]   Just imagine what this poor sap is going to have to do now to reach real enlightenment during his lifetime!  Poor thing!
<br>
<br>
Then again, sometimes you're the student, and then sometimes you're the lesson.  Maybe this guy came to earth in order to hold a mirror up to the rest of us, to show us just how STUPID we look when we get all snooty and moralistic and damning, whatever the topic we're busy ranting about. [

Yes, absolutely. The understanding of which is prerequisite to maintaining the ability to remain emotionally neutral. But these kinds of people sure give a stern lecture.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
This is a typical example where these evangelists, like most religious zealots, interpret everything in material terms.
<br>
<br>
The true aspect of a human being, i.e. the part that is the "image of God" (The Great Spirit, Divine Providence etc.) is the immortal Spirit, which is beyond sex in both literal and gender terms.
<br>
<br>
What really matters in the great ascent back to our creator includes enoblement of the Soul and Spirit, destruction of the ego, Unconditional love and realisation of the Spirit (or God) within, all of which is a art of the ultimate path to perfection and unity.
<br>
<br>
"God" does not exhibit petty human emotions or discrimination.  Everyone without exception is subject to the same immutable Universal laws. If only some of these religious fanatics did but know that rather than receiving preferential treatment in "heaven", they are much more likely to end up being stuck in the hell of a belief system territory.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Timeless,
<br>
<br>
I noticed the typo in your last post and started thinking...
<br>
Evangalist or Avengalist
<br>
<br>
New word - Avengalist - religious zealot avenging in the name of god, usually as a cover for their own nasty agenda.
<br>
<br>
Works for me! [
