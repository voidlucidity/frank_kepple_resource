Sorry Frank, but I remember you were going to start a new thread about the topic I brought up; if you remember, the issue I was wondering about was that of 'hauntings' and such like; ie of those ex-physical people who are fixated on the physical world and if/how much influence they can have on it.
<br>
<br>
I remember Monroe describing a scene in the rtz where he witnessed deceased individuals trying desperatly to get reactions from in-physical humans, but finding that they just walked right through them and so on (Far Journeys). I'm just wondering how that gels with your findings where non-physical people cannot even percieve the physical world, never mind attempt to interact with it...
<br>
However, since the rtz IS an astral zone, sometimes called the etherial level, but is so close to the physical as to be an almost exact match, is it not possible for those who are fixated with a particular area of the physical to exist in or close to the rtz, thus allowing a level of interaction?
<br>
<br>
I believe that in certain circumstances this close relationship can sometimes allow some 'bleed through' that results in manifestations in the physical world (esp. in places where a significant emotional event has occured, such as a murder or whatever).. often called 'hauntings' and 'ghosts', a subject of research by Bruce Moen and others.
<br>
<br>
Just wondered if you had any input/opinions on the above scenario

<section>
Douglas,
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are right. Thanks for the reminder, and it is on my to-do list of replies. I've been busy preparing a special report that I will be posting to the forum in a few days (hopefully). It took me a little longer than I thought. Once that's complete, I had it in mind to answer the questions raised by your previous post I talked about in my PM.
<br>
<br>
What we can do is leave this topic open, and I'll reply here and change the title heading. As you are quite right, we were a bit off-topic on the other post and should create a new one.
<br>
<br>
Speak to you soon.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
