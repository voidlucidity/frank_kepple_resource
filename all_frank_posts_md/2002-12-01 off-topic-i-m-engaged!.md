<section>
Hello everyone......
<br>
<br>
I know this is off topic, but I thought I would share with you that I proposed to my girlfriend, Brandi, on Friday and she said yes.
<br>
<br>
Here is a picture of the ring I got her:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://myjokemail.com/DiamondRing.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
<br>
Even though we've been a couple for almost 3 1/2 years, I have never told her that I have projections (OBE/AP).  I keep telling myself, "Ok, maybe you should do it tonight."  But then the time comes around and the moment isn't right.
<br>
<br>
I would like to wait until I can do this at will, so I will have better control over these things when I discuss them with her.  Until then, I just keep my mouth shut, even though I feel like she is closed off from a big part of me because of my silence on the subject.  Anyone else feel like that?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>
<br>

Congratulations man !

I'm happy for ya!
<br>
<br>
I think you should tell her about it.. it seems like astral projection and OBEs are very important to you and if your keeping it from her.. think about what she is missing out on.  Who better to trust than her fiance
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I think you should tell her.. the sooner she knows , the sooner she may take an interest and experience for herself first hand. I can understand why you wanna have more control over it and do it by your own will before you decide to tell her. I'm kinda the same way about it with my girlfriend. I already told her that I wanted her to try to get into it with me but I'm not pushing the subject until I can do it as often as I want.
<br>
<br>
PS: Maybe you could leave something out ( a book on OBEs ) or the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///astralpulse.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 astralpulse.com
</a>
website on the computer screen so she could find out for herself first? It may strike more interest in her.. I dunno , thats just an idea I got.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats my 2 cents heh again congrats and best wishes to you both!

<section>
hey Alpha and Zarkon,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the replies.  She knows that I have an interest in the paranormal, and I have tons of books on OBE's, but I think she just feels that it's an interest of mine.  She really has no idea that I can actually experience this firsthand, no matter how many books I leave lying around.
<br>
<br>
I guess the main reason why I (and perhaps others?) have kept this a secret from my significant other is because part of me feels like I need to have a few secrets of my own.  It may sound silly, but knowing that this is my little secret keeps an air of mystery about me.  It's kind of like knowing you can fly, but you don't want to show anyone else because it makes you feel a little more special.
<br>
<br>
God, that sounds so egocentrical.  But the other part of me says, "You doofus, tell her!  You don't want to die and then never have the chance to tell her that this is all real and that you're really not dead in the traditional sense of the word.  Tell her so that whether she believes it or not, she'll know that YOU believe it."
<br>
<br>
Ahhh, decisions decisions.  Anyway, thanks for the congrats on the engagement.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Congratulations Jeff!
<br>
<br>
I think you should tell her, mainly because death can come at any moment, and I think it's our duty as astral travellers (ok, not me, but the rest of you), to pass this on to our loved ones, so they can learn for themselves that "they are not this physical body".
<br>
<br>
Good luck with that.

Hey Tisha !
<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly .... I was on the "don't tell her" side.....and you were my nemesis on the "tell her" team !
<br>
<br>
I've been telling my girlfriend more and more as I go - she had sleep paralysis yesterday, and she was pretty interested to find a section on it in one of the books on my shelf.

Jeff: congratulations.
<br>
<br>
Please don't worry too much about the "not telling her" aspect. My wife is at a very basic stage of development and it is a big challenge for me to introduce her to even the most simple aspects... even just remembering dreams.
<br>
<br>
Here's wishing you both the very best of luck.

<section>
Jeff,
<br>
<br>
Some advice on the soon to be wife....
<br>
<br>
Be careful.  I am married and approached the topic with my wife.. I told her about an experience I once had when I was younger to feel her out.  She looked at me like I was crazy and told me not to go around talking to people about it.  After that I realized she probably wouldn't take well to me exploring deeper into OBEs etc.
<br>
<br>
If she knows you like to read books on the topic, etc.  As her in conversation what she thinks about it, but pay close attention to how she responds.   If she looks at you like you have two heads, then I would keep it a private practice.  If she comes back and says, yeah that happened to me, at least you have a common dialogue and can let her in as much or as little as you want.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,
<br>
<br>
