Hello to everyone... yeah, you gonna look at my amount of posts and gonna think I'm a noob.  But i've never really posted but i've been coming here everyday for about a year now and been talkin to "Tom" (tomskinney on aim) for a while now on aim... he's been helping me out a lot, but i'd like to share what i've been through this last year and what my problems are.  Maybe this will help some people, and others will help me with my own problems so here we go (please forgive my english, i'm french
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
).
<br>
<br>
So, how did I get into this field?  Well, I'm not going to lie, i really loved dbz (sorry
<img alt=":cry:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cry.png" title="Cry"/>
) and i started doing energy work.  But i learned a lot since then.  I know what can be achieved and what can't.  I started NEW about a year and a half ago.  I raised energy and became better always learning new things.  It is also around that time i found out about astralpulse.  So i'd go and check the energy section from time to time and i got interested in lucid dreams.   I have many, many lucid dreams, i don't know why, but i guess i'm just gifted at it.  So i would read people's experience and sometimes i would read things about obe's but never would search more about it being too lazy.
<br>
<br>
I kept raising energy for about half a year but never really got too far with it or really had big ambitions so it got kinda boring.  This is when i started reading this section of the forum and checking astraldynamics (robert bruce's site) and learning about obe's.  It seemed facinating... i was imagining my self with infinite power...  I'd think i would get out and become a God... fly around, see new people, have a second life.  But results did not come fast...
<br>
<br>
I started reading about meditation and about techniques on how to exit the body.  I bought books and what not and started working hard about 3 months ago....  Withing a month i could feel small vibrations.  A month later came something that absolutely terrified me... I thought i was going to die fo reals.  I did my regular routine and started meditating reaching for those vibes...  after 20-30 minutes they came.... but much stronger than before.  Kind of like a big earthquake all over my body.  My breath was racing like if i sprinted a mile, and my heart was stomping so hard that it sounded like a subwoofer.  My body was shaking so hard (or so i thought, it was just energy rushing through), i thought i was going to fall off my bed, but i tried to stay still.  It got stronger, and i eventually got too scared. I thought i was going into cardiac arrest or something.  I woke up with my body all wet full of sweat.  I knew from there on that i got very close.  Next day i talked to Tom, and he informed me that it was energy and that i had to try to ignore it.
<br>
<br>
I kept getting vibes but never got out.  I would lucid dream and i would become aware and try to get out but vibes would hit and then fade away, until one day...  i was lucid dreaming and i got half way out (someway somehow).  My torso was sticking out and i could see my body when i turned my face around but my lower body (leggs) were stuck... no way to get out... i eventualy got back into my body.  Wow, once again, i almost got out, but always progressing.  So, next day i talk to Tom again and he tells me my legs weren't relaxed.  Since then, no really bigger results... havent goten out at all since then... still feel vibes but that's it...  i still have problems which i need to work on and these are:
<br>
<br>
1.  i sometimes go so deep in trance that i fall asleep
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
.... but that doesn't happen that often.
<br>
2.  my hands sometimes jerk real bad and it breaks my meditation, but im working on that with Tom.
<br>
3.  saliva is really anoying... i can go on without thinking about it but after a while my body just swallows by it self and i awake.
<br>
4.  vibes come but then they fade away and i don't get out
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this wasn't too long. again sorry for my english... i hope this can help/inspire some people... if it's really bad that people can't understand... ill delete it myself....

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I note you are taking what might be called the more traditional "energy work" route. In which case the sensations you talk about are, in fact, very normal. Which is, of course, one of the big problems with these kinds of techniques.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I love setting off my heart energy centre. The intense energy sensations I find a big laugh, and I revel in them personally. But that's only because I've been doing this for so long I got used to it all. Beginners, however, tend to get totally freaked out by it.
<br>
<br>
The main problem with traditional obe work is, I feel, the "separation from the physical body" construct. This tends to make the person freak out thinking they have "died" and all manner of mixed-up realities start coming into play.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hey French, your post was just fine.  I'm am going to tell you what everybody else here is going to tell you... Practice, practice, practice.  I believe some of the posts you are reading on this site concerning people able to project with such frequency are people who have been doing this for a VERY long time.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I read a post by Frank that said he has been at this for over 20 years!
<br>
<br>
<br>
My bit of advise to keep you going... don't be so worried about the end goal of projection without struggle.  Every step along the way is an adventure.
<br>
<br>
And the four things you mentioned at the end of your post are all typical of early projection work.  Search the forums for these topics, but they happen to everyone, so your on the right track!
<br>
<br>
Good luck!
<br>
Will

Thanks for the replies.... and yeah, Tom from the board.  He is very nice and seems very experienced.  I was surprised he didn't brush me off when I first talked to him.  He's been a real help to my progress.
