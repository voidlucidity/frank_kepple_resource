"usergroups" are something that the admin can setup and others can join ... it's the link near the top right.

Usergroups are really quite handy but it's more for things like forum permisions and access.

It says none exist. Shoot. I want to make some. How about some for video gamers, some for those of certain religions, those who want certain practises, etc. You could send out newsletters and all sorts of fun stuff!

Or maybe one for those who are actively involved in the Astral Pulse Island experiment?

Actually usergroups are used for things like giving special powers to certain users in specific forums like letting GroupX members create polls in certain forums or allowing certain members to act as Forum Police in all forums without being mods in each forum or an admin. They are also a nice way to let people have access to hidden forums 'n such.

Anyways, they are nothing like yahoo usergroups if that's what people are thinking.
