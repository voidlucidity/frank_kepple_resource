Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your interest but it's not actually published yet!
<br>
<br>
As I mentioned in my latest newsletter I'll be setting up my Virtual Classroom soon and once that's underway then I'll be using our joint experiences to provide some infill on the mechanics of the approach. I need this book to be as comprehensive as possible before it's released and even then it'll no doubt be subject to a number of up-issues. What I want to create is not just some book, and that's it. I want to release a complete compendium of Phasing knowledge that will set the standard for many, many years to come.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
