At least three times, I rolled partially out of my body! It's real! It's incredible!
<br>
<br>
Ok, I have a question. As I tipped out, lying face down next to my body, I couldn't breath, presumably because I didn't have any lungs.
<br>
<br>
But this was very disconcerting, and I felt very much like I should take a breath, so I rolled back in. I took a few breaths, tipped back out, and couldn't breath again. I felt like I was "running out of air" but it could have been my imagination.
<br>
<br>
Besides "don't focus on it so it's not an issue" does anyone have any suggestions?
<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!
<br>

You didn't run out of air so much as run out of energy. Plus, the sense of consciousness that you take with you is basically the same as the sense of consciousness you have in the physical. Maybe it got a little confused as, from the wording of your post, it sounds like your first time.
<br>
<br>
Your post reminds me of the first time I visited an underwater region in the Astral. My sense of consciousness balked big-time at the thought of going underwater without Scuba gear. The guide who I happened to be with gradually coaxed me under. The key is to take things step my step and introduce your mind to the experience very gradually.

 Most definitely my first time. Interesting. So you couldn't tell a chakra from a hole in the ground, but you've got "energy" in your conceptual framework?

 <br>
 To me, running out of energy means I need to keep exercising my energy body, and raise tons of energy before I make a projection attempt.
 <br>
 <br>
 What's your solution to running out of energy, Frank?
 <br>
 <br>
 Thanks, Frank and anyone else who replies!

I'm sorry but I think we are speaking totally at cross purposes.
<br>
<br>
I hear terms such as "energy raising" and I honestly have no idea what is meant by this. All I know is in my Astral experiences I often came across circumstances where I would feel weak and the physical would pull me back. The solution, I found in Astral Dynamics where RB suggests looking at your hands for an instant (but not too long so as they melt) which causes a burst of energy to revitalise you. It worked great, I found.
<br>
<br>
I am a scientist with an electronics and mechanical engineering background. So, yes, it is a fact that I've got various degrees of "energy concepts" held in my conceptual framework.
<br>
<br>
But until today (thanks again Mobius) Chakras were not one of them.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I totally understand that this energy body stuff is foreign to you.
<br>
<br>
Let me clarify my question:
<br>
<br>
You used the term "energy," and said it sounded like I might have been running out of it. What do *you* mean by energy? General vitality, it looks like? Besides looking at your hands, do you have any other suggestions for dealing with lack of energy, as *you* use the term?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
The energy referred to in metaphysical terms is not something that conventional science recognises - or understands.
<br>
<br>
This energy "cosmic" energy if you like, sometimes called "Psi" energy, "Prana" and serveral other such names. I am not sure whether Reikki is the same - I suppose it must be.
<br>
<br>
But this is the energy of the universe, the primordal energy which permeates everything. It is the energy used in some Magic, healing, and many, many other metaphysical things.
<br>
<br>
It is invisible, but very powerful. The first time I raised energy I was amazed at its sheer power. I can now create energy "Psi" balls just by visualisation, and I can feel the heat and power as my hands are pushed apart under the force of the Psi energy betweem my hands. That energy is also the energy of the Astral - you can do alot with it!
<br>
<br>
When I raise energy through my main chakras centres, I can see the centres as spinning vortices of the appropriate colour, and feel the heat and other sensations. Energy raised before an OBE can make a big difference.
<br>
<br>
The other area of interest is projecting into the real-time zone, before heading off to the Astral - the more etheric energy you have, the longer you can stay in the RTZ. Projecting into the RTZ with energy, and then to the Astral is effectively reproducing what happens after physical death - so it is worth getting to understand.
<br>
<br>
As usual - Robert has an excellent article on this subject - well worth a read:
