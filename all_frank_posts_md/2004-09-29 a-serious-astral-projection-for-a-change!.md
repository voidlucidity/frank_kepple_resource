A bit of a long one, but very interesting (at least to me anyway!)
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I didn't fall asleep, but was very close to it.  I noticed the top half of my body was slowly moving backwards.  Immediately, I knew this was my astral body and I "pushed" it so it would go faster.  It did.  I then thought that rather than push, I should go limp, so I did this, but I just went slower.  I was obviously totally astral.  I carried on pushing myself, but realised I wasn't actually going anywhere, except round in circles.  So then I pushed my body upwards, and I started moving that way.  It was very pleasant doing this pushing.  I'd never done it before.  It wasn't mental, but more of an energy push – hard to describe.
 <br>
 <br>
 Next I thought I'd better get out.  I got a bit tangled in all the bedclothes, which was a tad infuriating, but I managed it in the end!  I noticed my sight was very dull in the bedroom, like a hazy black and white film (very hazy I might add).  I quickly moved into the hall, where things were better.
 <br>
 <br>
 Someone was in the hall with me.  It was my Grandma Ellison.  I wasn't surprised at this, nor did I really acknowledge it.  I was preoccupied with finding an astral doorway to take much notice of her, although her presence was related to me, she wasn't just there doing her own thing.  I took her with me to the front room.  I didn't get any sound from her, but now I think that is because I was so mentally "noisy" and didn't give her a chance.
 <br>
 <br>
 I couldn't see any obvious doorways, so I started circling with my finger again, then suddenly I remembered I wanted to go through one of our new pictures in the lounge.  Off I trot to the lounge.  I think Grandma gave up on me then, because I don't remember her after that.  On my way to the lounge, I thought about my drawings, but realised they hadn't been put up on the wall yet, and then knew which pictures I was going in.
 <br>
 <br>
 I stood in the lounge and moved forward into the picture on the left side.  I could get my head in and everything changed.  How on earth do I describe this?  Soft, peaceful, different, very different from the physical world, but subtly and gently different.  I found I couldn't go any further than my head, so I pulled my head out.
 <br>
 <br>
 I seemed to bring the new world to the RTZ, because when I went to go into the other picture, it wasn't there on the wall, even though I knew it should be.  I could just see softness, so I went into the space where the right hand picture was anyway.
 <br>
 <br>
 I found myself looking at a beautiful, soft landscape.  I keep using the word "soft" because there was nothing dramatic nor obvious about it.  Just pastel hills, all different colours, rolling hills, no high peaks, nothing jagged.  Someone was with me.  She was female, young (my age), and told me (not via speech) that she would take me to our castle.
 <br>
 <br>
 The next image is that we are riding on horses to get to this castle.  I am naked and riding the horse, which is a wonderful feeling (not sexual, just very free).  My horse is black, hers is brown.  When we arrive at the castle, we dismount and my black horse turns into a black Doberman dog.  I show a little fear as I wonder if it will turn and snap at me.  As I think this, it looks like it is going to, so I turn quickly away.
 <br>
 <br>
 The next image is I am in the castle looking out through one of the turrets at the landscape below.  It is utterly peaceful, calm, pastel colours, rolling hills.  My female friend is next to me and I know that we are lovers and have been in the castle now for many years.  We are young (late teens?), and our lives are comfortable, in that we don't need to work.  We never age.  We just live in our castle, enjoying each other.  I feel her come up behind me and hug me, her hands on my breasts.  I do actually literally feel this, as in a lucid dream.
 <br>
 <br>
 The next image is that we have just finished making love (of this part I don't recall), and 4 young men/boys have come to visit the castle.  They have obviously heard us and when we open the door, they have grins all over their faces.  At this point, I become a watcher, and see myself and my female lover for the first time.  We are both young, lithe, very fit, both with cropped short hair, boyish looking.  I look slightly more feminine.  Both very attractive, pixie looking young girls.  Both looking very happy.
 <br>
 <br>
 The next image is one of destruction and war, although not directly near the castle.  The effects of war.  Everything is dark and depressing.  My lover has caught some fever or disease (typhoid?) and needs medicine.  We have a housekeeper, an older woman, and my lover is calling to her to get the medicine for her.  I am still well and panicking, not knowing what to do.  My lover has collapsed on the outside of the castle and I know that if she doesn't get her medicine, she will die.  The housekeeper is walking away from us.  I shout to her "where are you going".  She tells me she has had enough and is going to join the war.  I never get to see her face, she always has her back to me.  She looks old and is wearing a shawl and bonnet.
</font>
<br>
<br>
Then, in physical life, the postman drops the letters through the door and I instantly fully regain waking consciousness.
<br>
<br>
<br>

 <font color='"purple"'>
  This has thrown up a lot of thought.  The castle/lover scene was astral, I believe, and not a dream.  I don't have dreams like that.  I wonder if it was a life I once lived/am to live?  It had that kind of feel to it – even though I don't believe in reincarnation!!
  <br>
  <br>
  I wish I'd taken more notice of Grandma – I was so preoccupied with my own little self, I didn't think to talk to her.  I ask for my guides – get them – and then ignore them – silly me.  I do hope they will give me a second/third/fourth chance!
  <br>
  <br>
  The landscape was so serene.  I've tried to draw it, and captured the feel of it, but it's not very good.

Wow!!  In my opinion, that really sounds like a past-life.
<br>
<br>
I know you said you don't believe in it, but I've heard of LOTS of people whom didn't believe in reincarnation until after spending some time in the astral.
<br>
<br>
I've had several past-live experiences and by re-visiting them I came away with something everytime.  IMO they've helped me grow to be a better person in one way or another.[

Hi Sarah,
<br>
That was worthwhile every bit. Funny that these things happen when you're not planning for them. I loved reading it and recognize when you mention that you were mentally "noisy". I try to meditate in the evening and experience how dificult it is to direct my attention for a longer period of time on a thing, and how easy the mental chit-chat 'sneakes' my attention away.

I always reccomend having an OBE gameplan memorised before each attempt.  Like a kid in a candy store with lots of $$$, too many choises and not enough decisions.

Don't worry about grandma, she has plenty of time to wait on the impatience of youth [

In my opinon you re-united with a soulmate that is still on the other side of the veil.  Maybe a guide?  Maybe waiting until you retrun until venturing out agian, maybe even waiting for your children?  Or maybe just a fling for old times sake [

<section>
Wow.  Thanks for your comments everyone.
<br>
<br>
I've had a few days to think about it and whilst I said I don't believe in reincarnation, I also don't NOT believe in reincarnation - if that makes sense.
<br>
<br>
I'm open to it and I hope to have many more experiences like this one.
<br>
<br>
I sense this is just the beginning of a new direction in life for me.
<br>
<br>
I've been groping around in the RTZ for the past year, and felt I needed to "progress" spiritually.  This experience was just that - a progression.
<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to many more - I know this is only the start!
<br>
<br>
Yippee. [

Groping around the RTZ is not a lot of fun. I only learned how to project my consciousness into this region after having had hundreds of projections within the astral. I can't see what all the fuss is about, to be honest. Okay, seeing my sleeping physical whilst floating on the ceiling was something of a novelty. But it quickly wore off. The astral is the place to be, IMO.
<br>
<br>
From what you describe I'd hesitate to call it a past-life experience. Firstly, everyone has other aspects of themselves. These aspects normally come across as other people, but they form part of a person's whole character. These others are generally free to live their lives but are not necessarily incarnate within a physical realm. Aspects of ourselves can reside within various levels of astral plane too. Myself I have various aspects of myself that can pop up in the most unlikely of places.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
And that is the situation I think you came across.
<br>
<br>
It is possible to step into the life of another aspect of yourself. Meaning you see as they see and feel as they feel, etc. Plus you can step out and become like you are seeing them from a short distance away. Or, once you get proficient at it, you can do both at the same time. A strong, reliable indicator that can almost always tell you where you are, i.e. whether you are physical or astral, is the landscape. From what you describe it sounds very astral.
<br>

Hi,
<br>
Thanks for sharing such a captivating account of your experience! The characters and landscape have great depth and richness, and you managed to recall a great deal of detail, I love adventures such as these, they can rest in memory for a long time after the event.
<br>
<br>
I found very interesting what Frank said about people having other aspects of themselves and that they can come across as other people, but form the whole of a persons character.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps such experiences are a kind of individuation? Looking from a Jungian perspective, maybe we are projecting out characterisations of the self, the Ego, the Anima/Animus and the Shadow and performing a kind of role-play as a means of personal growth?
<br>
<br>
The above is only an idea and I don't mean to detract from your wonderful experience, I too have often had experiences with characters where they truly do have a life and identity of their own.
<br>
<br>
Characters often provide me with advice, information or simple chit chat that seems quite random and spontaneous, this can often be very surprising and startling to hear such an impromptu or unforced remark!
<br>
<br>
I really like your idea of trying to draw your experience, this is something that I do on a regular basis as well as keeping a written account. I find pictures have much more power for capturing a scene or a moment.
<br>
<br>
Another technique you could try is to take clippings from old magazines and make a collage of the landscape, scenery and characters. These montages can often work quite well and have a photographic quality that can capture the surreal essence and mood of these kinds of adventures.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
<br>
