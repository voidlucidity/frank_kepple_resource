<br>
<br>
<br>
A guy is strolling down the street in London when he comes across an old lamp. He picks it up, rubs it vigorously, and out pops a genie. The genie offers to grant him one wish, to which the guy replies, "I've always wanted to be lucky."
<br>
<br>
The genie grants his wish. So off he strolls, wondering how this will change his life. Suddenly he spies £10 on the footpath. Not a bad start he thinks.
<br>
<br>
As he picks it up, he notices a betting shop across the road. He strolls over, looks through the racing lists, and sees a horse
<br>
named Lucky Lad at 100/1 in the 4th race at Ascot. He puts 10 quid on the nose and, what do you know, the horse bolts up.
<br>
<br>
Feeling on a bit of a roll, he heads to the local casino, fronts up at the roulette table and puts the whole 1010 quid on "Lucky seven." Round and round the wheel spins, and "bang!" It stops on Lucky Seven.
<br>
<br>
Now he's really flying: so what better way to celebrate than to head to the local brothel for a bit of horizontal folk dancing. He knocks and enters. All of a sudden he is showered with streamers and handed a glass of champagne.
<br>
<br>
The madam of the establishment puts her arm around him and says, "Welcome sir! We have much pleasure in informing you that you are our lucky one-millionth customer. You have won the right to enjoy the pleasures on offer from any girl who works here, absolutely free of charge."
<br>
<br>
The bloke says he's always fancied making it with an Indian girl... so he's immediately ushered into one of the rooms.
<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, in strolls the most gorgeous sub-continental he has ever seen. Not much time passes before clothing is strewn around the room and the Karma Sutra is being well and truly gone through.
<br>
<br>
Having a brief respite, the guy says to the girl, "You are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life, and I can't believe how lucky I am. But there is one thing I don't really like about Indian women... it's that red spot you all have on your forehead."
<br>
<br>
The Indian girl looks him in the eye and says, "Sir, I am here to please you, and succumb to your every desire. If you wish to see it gone, then please scratch off my caste mark."
<br>
<br>
So he goes at it with his fingernail. All of a sudden he leans back and starts laughing his butt off. "What's wrong, what's wrong?" asks the Indian girl.
<br>
<br>
"You're never going to believe this, but I've just won a car!"
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, I did say it was getting late.
