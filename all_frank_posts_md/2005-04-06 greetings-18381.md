<section>
My name is Amalthea, I have had natural psychic awareness for as long as I can remember, and have been actively exploring for the past 7 years.  I have invasive visions and nightmares, many of which seem to be connected to my past life experiences, primarily in what seems to be Scotland in the Age of Hero's, about 350 BCE or so, and have been under attack by a psychic vampire who all intuition tells me could well have been my older brother in that life.  I'm not yet sure if his natural energies are just so overwhelming they drown out my perception of other possibilities, but Ive found unmistakable patterns in names and memories and instances that lead me to believe there is something important at work there, despite how bad he makes me feel, and I hope that I can grow through this experience with the help of this community!  If anyone knows anything about such things, or is interested in exploring the concepts of "astral lineage" and reincarnation with me, please don't hesitate to send me a message!  And also if anyone is interested in investigating evidence of astral awareness in art and the history of psychic awareness.

Thank you! I will do just that as soon as I can. I think I should read a couple books first, but I'm sure I will have a lot of fun in the forums as soon as I get a solid chunk of time to sit down and get into it.  I appreciate the nice welcome!
