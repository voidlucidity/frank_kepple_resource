This happens to me very frequently.
<br>
<br>
I am a huge art fan and I keep doing art even if I get exams, even if I get illnesses.
<br>
<br>
But, the fun thing is that. . . when I am engrossed for about 6 continuous hours in my previous piece while giving it final touches, ... after I finished it, I went to sleep directly without trying to AP ( as I was too tired) , sometime during the 4 hour nap, I was in a Lucid Dream, in the same realm as that I had just created for art's sake. . .
<br>
<br>
it was realy fun.
<br>
<br>
but, it raises two radical questions for me :
<br>
1) was an alternate universe created , by my own mind when I was doing art?
<br>
2) , or, does me, doing lucid dreams, totally identical with the process of astral projection, mean that , the entire astral projection thing, is a creation of the 'brain' ( note that I am not using the word 'mind' here.

<section>
okay, u didnt tell me that wether astral projections and lucid dreams of the above mentioned sorts are 'projections to real realms' or only a 'brain generated fantasy' or a 'mind generated universe'
<br>
<br>
please note I use 'mind' and 'brain' to imply different meanings

1)
<br>
<br>
You entered the area known as Focus-2 of consciousness and offered yourself the experience of discovering the source of the objective image that you created.
<br>
<br>
2)
<br>
<br>
Astral Projection is a term that describes a particular type of mental construct that offers people a basic framework they can use to objectively experience certain areas of subjective reality. I'm not sure how this could possibly be a creation of the brain. The brain is merely an interface that communicates signals from subjective areas of consciousness to the physical body.
<br>
<br>
As a concept, Astral Projection would be a creation of the imagination, which is held within Focus-2 of consciousness.

Dear Frank
<br>
I was wondering if you remember any place where you have in another thread described the different Focus levels, if not would it be too much to ask you to. It seems that my experiences are changing a lot and a accurate identification would sure help.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Regards Mustardseed
