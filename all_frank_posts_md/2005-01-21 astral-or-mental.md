Hello Everybody,
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a question - everybody's talking about OBE here and calls it astral traveling. I believe that most people who astral travel actually don't because they "Mental travel".
<br>
<br>
In other words they separate their spirit/ their mental body which they use to travel. As I have read in a book by F. Bardon Separating Astral body takes much more effort than separating mental body.
<br>
<br>
Total separation of both bodies, astral and mental, when astral body also is separated is mystically called Extacy. In this state physical body stops breathing and heart stops beating. This is why I believe that most of you rather travel with you're mental body, as this is quite dangerous and takes enourmous practice to learn. If any of you were to try this, please
<br>
keep in mind not to get disturbed during such a session because if another person touched you when your astral body is not present, in this extatic state, it would cause a physical death.
<br>
<br>
Please, if you can, share some ideas here, about which body do you separate. Wheather you have emotional experiences during obe.
<br>
<br>
Thanks
<br>
<br>
Radim

Uh...When you're projecting your heart doesn't stop. Lol that would suck.
<br>
<br>
Oh and almost every night you non-consciously leave your body...so if your right everyone would be dead.

Hi Radium
<br>
<br>
as with most information it always gets updated If i was you I would read roberts book called astral dynamics robert goes into depth explaining that during an obe you original body remains the same it only goes to sleep to stop it thrashing about while you are elsewhere also that you exist in an energy copy and that when you return to your original copy its the memories that need to be downloaded into your original in order for you to experience OBE your heart does not stop if it did you would get brain damage and then nobody would be able to write books about it in the first place If anybody wakes you up during an OBE you simply wake up thats all
<br>
<br>
regarding what body you are in you stay in both bodys and as far as emotial experiences yes sure the most wonderfull times ever
<br>
<br>
GoodLuck m8

Hello:
<br>
<br>
It depends upon which model of consciousness you subscribe to. People talk about astral bodies versus mental bodies, etc. and forget (or perhaps do not realise) that these are constructs we create for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
It may well feel or look, for example, that a person "separates" their astral/mental/or whatever, whatever "body". but there is no separation in consciousness! The only boundaries are the ones we create; the only separation that exists is a distinction that we create also. We create everything. All our reality is created by us. Nothing exists outside of us. What you perceive are not artefacts that are somehow produced by, or in some way belong to, the wider reality. They are all aspects of your experience that
<i>
 you create for yourself
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Likewise, people talk about "astral travel" we don't actually travel anywhere. We already occupy these areas of consciousness, so there is nowhere we can travel to where we currently aren't. What people call "astral travel" is a kind of reminder they offer themselves of the reality of their existence, in some place other than this current physical. Only what they see is an objective
<i>
 translation
</i>
of that wider reality. How you form your translation is entirely down to you. As I say, it is your translation, it's your creation.
<br>
<br>
From the standpoint of being
<i>
 immersed
</i>
in one reality, another reality will be viewed as an objective translation. If I allow myself to become completely immersed within another reality, for example, I fully merge with another focus, then the physical (together with my physical life here) becomes to me "like a dream". When I cease merging with the other individual and focus within the physical again, I become completely immersed within this reality and the reality I was merged with before, now becomes to me "like a dream".
<br>
<br>
It's just that when people are starting out, they tend to project from the standpoint of the physical being the only
<i>
 real
</i>
reality, and everything "non-physical" thus gets viewed as an objective translation. But the early explorers didn't realise this. By and large, it appears they believed that what they saw and/or experienced was the actual reality. So they wrote about it as if that was what existed, in fact. But it's all just an objective translation!
<br>
<br>
Unfortunatey, you only get to realise this when you get proficient to the extent you can become fully immersed within another reality, and retain a high degree of mental control over your experience (the two work very much hand in hand). It is then that these truths begin to emerge.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
