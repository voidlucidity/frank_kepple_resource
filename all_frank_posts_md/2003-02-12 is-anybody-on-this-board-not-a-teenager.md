As far as I can tell, everyone on this board is still a kid, which is kinda strange.

I'm 20 years old. but to be honest It doesnt matter if there are a couple of teenagers on the forums. I feel like although us younger people may not have as much experience as older members, we can still have a lot of wisom to offer, same goes for people younger than me. It can often be an advantage to be younger and therefore not conditioned by society.

<section>
good post parmenion. i was just about to post something like that too. age doesn't ALWAYS mean anything, but it usually can indicate a bit of a bias towards thought patterns, suseptability (spelling?), gullability, and naivette... but not in everyone.

Yeah, I'm 13. I was at another forum once and they were all shocked when I revealed my age. [|)]
<br>
<br>
I don't think it's strange at all, because the younger you are the more open-minded you tend to be.
<br>
<br>
I remember someone else posting something about teenage years being the best to play around with energy. Maybe something about hormones amplifys the effects? Just a thought...

It seems that I was mistaken. I am 28 and thought that I was one of the youngest people here. Yesterday was my birthday. It was nice enough. Cake and ice cream. Most of the people I am around think I look younger than my age but act older than it.

I'm 36. I had my first introduction to the paranormal when I was 14. I've been ignoring a lot of messages from the spirit world since then. Not ignoring them anymore.

<section>
each person is different hashpuppet. i think it more depends on what physical sense you would be mimicing most with your spiritual sense as to whether you will see a ki ball or not, and especially when.
<br>
<br>
can't even give a rough estimate: some people see spiritual stuff without ever doing any spiritual work, others will do spiritual training their entire life and never see it.

Most of the people I choose to spend time with in real life are at least 40. It causes me to think of myself as being older than I actually am (28).

I'm 22 and sometimes I don't know if I'm crazy or if spirits do talk to me or if it's all in my head or what, but I try responding back. I'm not sure if it worked or not. Everything's kind of fuzzy for me right now, like a TV with too much static.

34. Got the spiritual wallop around, what, 13 or so.
<br>
<br>
But age as we count it is a physical feature. What we are is more of an attitude. Count your money, enjoy your lessons.
