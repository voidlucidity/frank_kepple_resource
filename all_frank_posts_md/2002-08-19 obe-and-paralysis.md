Please tell me if any of you have had an experience like this:
<br>
<br>
I had a dream my friend and I were at a store and the store was about to close so we were deciding where to go after. We both thought we should go to a campground or something. Suddenly we were on a hill looking at a lake and I kind of wondered how we got there. I didn't remember walking or driving there. Then we sat for awhile and got a little bored, so we decided to try  a different campground instead.
<br>
After we formed the thought we magically appeared at another campground. This time I knew something was odd. Then I realized I was dreaming. My favorite thing to do while dreaming is to fly, so I jumped up and floated over the trees. I had an intense vibration going through my body and I became extremely excited.  Then I felt a tugging feeling and began to fall. While falling I didn't see the ground and landed in my body. I thought I was awake, so I opened my eyes. My arms were out in front of me in an akward position, so I tried to move them. I was paralyzed and started to panic.
<br>
Then my 2nd body got up out of bed and I looked down at myself wondering why I was laying with my arms like that. I tried to push them down and couldn't. While I was pushing them I could feel it as though I was 2 people at once. I got scared so I stepped back and stared at my body for about 3-5 minutes, then I tried a few more times until I became tired and fell asleep on the floor next to the bed. So I was sleeping both on my bed and next to it at the same time. I had a weird dream so I woke up (still on the floor) and checked my body on the bed to see if I had moved. I hadn't so I tried to move myself again. I couldn't so I layed back on the floor and had two more dreams. Eventually I woke up and was back in my body.
<br>
<br>
I posted this before, but then it disapeared. I am hoping some one can share their experiences and/or tell me why this happened and what I should do if it happens again. PLEASE!

These kinds of experiences are very common. All you are doing is dreaming on the base-level Astral with varying degrees of conscious awareness. I put a few pointers in [square brackets] in the body of your post to assist you in trying to make some kind of sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
[Sense of conscious awareness comes awake to the point where you can sense your dream.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 I had a dream my friend and I were at a store and the store was about to close so we were deciding where to go after.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[To travel within the Astral you focus with intent on where you want to be.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 We both thought we should go to a campground or something. Suddenly we were on a hill looking at a lake and I kind of wondered how we got there. I didn't remember walking or driving there.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[It was your intent that caused you to travel to that location.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Then we sat for awhile and got a little bored, so we decided to try a different campground instead. After we formed the thought we magically appeared at another campground. This time I knew something was odd.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[Again, intent caused the movement to the new location. Also, your sense of conscious awareness is coming awake more, i.e. thinking becomes more rational and critical faculties start coming into play.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Then I realized I was dreaming. My favorite thing to do while dreaming is to fly, so I jumped up and floated over the trees. I had an intense vibration going through my body and I became extremely excited.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[Feeling a buzzing or vibration sensation is normal when travelling with an aware state of mind.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Then I felt a tugging feeling and began to fall. While falling I didn't see the ground and landed in my body. I thought I was awake, so I opened my eyes. My arms were out in front of me in an akward position, so I tried to move them. I was paralyzed and started to panic.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[A physical-body demand interrupted the fun and called you back. Somehow, rather than slipping back into your physical body, you found yourself in what is commonly called a "mind awake, body asleep state". Which, if you find yourself in by accident, not knowing that this is a
<u>
 very normal thing
</u>
, you can start to panic thinking you are physically paralysed, or are in the process of dying, and so forth.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Then my 2nd body got up out of bed and I looked down at myself wondering why I was laying with my arms like that. I tried to push them down and couldn't. While I was pushing them I could feel it as though I was 2 people at once.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[Again this is normal confusion caused by the "mind split" phenomenon. Basically, it is where you become aware of your physical body and your Astral body at the same time.]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 I got scared so I stepped back and stared at my body for about 3-5 minutes, then I tried a few more times until I became tired and fell asleep on the floor next to the bed. So I was sleeping both on my bed and next to it at the same time. I had a weird dream so I woke up (still on the floor) and checked my body on the bed to see if I had moved. I hadn't so I tried to move myself again. I couldn't so I layed back on the floor and had two more dreams. Eventually I woke up and was back in my body.
</i>
<br>
<br>
[Yes, when this happens I find it best just to simply go to sleep and wake up when it's all over, i.e. I am back in the Physical.]
<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem is, when this happens people naturally get scared. But the key thing to remember is don't panic. I feel that what you probably did was to overdo it when you were on the Astral. You say that when you were flying you became "extremely excited" and you need to please check this and find a way of stopping it happening.
<br>
<br>
There have been times when I have thrown caution to the wind and allowed myself to get over-excited in the sense that I have zoomed off somewhere trying to go faster and faster, and I've ended up slamming back into the Physical with a MASSIVE jolt. Following which I have found myself misaligned somehow and I cannot get fully in.
<br>
<br>
But, as I say, the best you can do for yourself in that situation is simply to go to sleep and let the two bodies sort it out amongst themselves.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
