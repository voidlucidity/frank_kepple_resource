I can't believe it this is my first conscious obe took me only 1 hour and a bit. Before I would have obe's from lucid dreams (but no spirits in them) now I was able to pull it off at the conscious level and it was so darn easy.  This is what I use I use the helichrysum oil to increase my physical energy so I actually feel electricty through my body when I do body awareness exercises, I use it like a mental marker so I know if I am focusing right if I am I will feel current/sparks if I focus super well some sparks will spark so much it'll start to itch in that spot.  The positive attitude I keep is in a desirous mood like sex (minus the private parts) saying boy does this feel (as a feeling not a verbal thing) or would feel good current running through my body it'll feel so good when I keep running current through the body to see if I can run it even more current with my desire/will.  Also today I only slept about 5 hours so I was a bit drowsy that helped a little but still my mind was alert (think it was those monroe tapes sharpens your focus).  I also use monroe institute immunizing cd (physical energy) (not as expensive as the gateway thats all you need though for hemisync) and tommy's vibration starter (bwgen.com preset) which has one part similar to immunizing (beginning/end of tape sound) just the beat slows down more as you listen to it, no dialogue.
<br>
<br>
So this is what I did and what the outcome was, I played the immunizing exercise, the way I breath in when I do body awareness I take deep breaths where the air goes all into the stomach stomach bloats through the nose I take it in and then let it out through the mouth at a slow pace or at the pace of the beat slowly, when there are parts where the man doesn't dialogue I keep even more aware of the electricy and body parts running through my body sometimes if I don't feel energy running through I do the stimulation thing in that part from robert's book.  After I finished the immunizing cd I played tommy's vibration starter did body awareness exercise more aware again then the cd stopped after 30mins I kept on doing it on my own.  Then after a little bit all of a sudden BIG rush of energy shot into my head at the left lobe and then felt it in my chest (thought this was physical energy to self heal) so I said wow I have to keep doing this so it gets even more intense then all of a sudden I was getting out of my body but my feet were stuck to my body so I said I better relax them then I did some awareness on my legs to get them unstuck then I said let me push myself upwards to the ceiling instead of forward motion going through the wall then all of a sudden it worked I got out then I had my sight as well rooms upstairs were dark like in real life, I went right through the wall and I swear I saw a spirit being in transparent white almost exactly the picture at the astralpulse website the woman at the top left hand corner saw this little girl in transparent white running down the stairs I think she saw me then was walking downstairs away from me I ran after her when I got halfway downstairs I saw other white/transparent spirit beings in the other room of the house I think she was walking towards to them then I thought I would get a little afraid talking/seeing these other spirits for the first time (first time to see in my obe's transparent spirits cause this was the real deal obe) so i aborted told myself to wakeup.
<br>
<br>
Is that how spirits look in transparent bright white identical to the woman picture at the top left corner of astralpulse website?
<br>
I wonder why I never had them (spirit beings) in my lucid dreams, was it because I had more energy/awareness since I did it at the conscious level obe?
<br>
<br>
And there were anomalies the top floor was dark (lights shut off) not the bottom floor in real world but in the astral it was all dark even the bottom, maybe my perception was of my room upstairs (viewing angel from upstairs) felt the whole house was dark cause I came from upstairs and stayed halfway upstairs (didn't go down the stairs all the way).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also when I was trying to get out (energy rush that shot through my body) I heard noise which did not come from my stereo set (knew it was shut off) like static or something came for few seconds then shut off I knew it was made up noise (like in robert's book mentioning this) didn't scare me a bit.
<br>
<br>
I believe reason my feet were stuck is I felt the energy in my left lobe and then it hit my chest it didn't go to my legs so I had to do the extra awareness to get my energy raised at my legs so I can obe when my feet were stuck.
<br>
<br>
Another weird thing is sometimes when I listen to the hemisync tapes and concentrate on the body awareness exercises the volume goes mute for a second. I know the tapes are fine I believe my mind is so focused on the body awareness exercise somtimes I enter a split second trance state then get out of it.
<br>
<br>
I believe the hemisync tapes work because with the helichrysum oil as a marker I feel more energy after I do it and are more relaxed but thats all they do though relax you as if you did a good meditation.
<br>
<br>
I can't wait to pull off another obe I've only been listening to monroe's/tommy's vibration starter stuff for a week now I think these helped a lot as tools.  I'd have to start to build my courage to confront these beings and talk to them, its scary cause its my first time and in real life you just don't see them in your house any tips on that?

That was an enjoyable read and it sounds like you are making good progress. The observation in the quote above I recognise very well. It happens to me in the early part of my projection rundown, and it's one of the markers I use that tells me my physical body is on the verge of dropping off to sleep.
<br>
<br>
As regards the "spirit beings" I think you might feel more comfortable if you thought of them as normal people. Only they are "normal" in the sense of being non-physical. It's just like on the Physical where, depending on genetic heritage, people's skin colour can be a lot lighter than others. Or their facial features may differ quite significantly. In a similar vein, some Astral residents can come across in a "ghostly" kind of way. Others you can chat to and you'd swear blind they were Physical. To the extent where you find yourself questioning, "Am I within Physical or Astral right now?" Higher-level residents, in their raw form, come across as a bundle of sparkly white light. Like a twinkling star surrounded by a radiant aura.
<br>
<br>
It's just one of the things you have to get used to. In that you have to encompass the idea that this Physical reality is not the
<u>
 only
</u>
reality that exists. There are people living within the Physical realm and there are people living within the Astral realm. I used to make the mistake of calling them "entities". Now I use the term "residents" in the sense of Astral residents and Physical residents.
<br>
<br>
One of the confusing aspects about the real-time zone is the possibility of having familiar scenes of your home/garden/neighbourhood, and so forth, in some way implanted in another - often very different - set of circumstances. The real-time zone is a buffer zone between Astral-matter and Physical-matter. As such, you can find yourself in a situation where you are half
<i>
 out
</i>
of one, and half
<i>
 in
</i>
another. Which is a bit freaky to get used to at first. With me, at the point of projection into the real-time zone, I often hear people chatting or get scenes of people moving around in my vicinity. At first I'd get mighty confused and think, "Hey, hold on a minute, these people shouldn't be in my house!"
<br>
<br>
Also, the static sounds you hear, I get that too especially at the point of projection. Plus, don't be surprised if you get to hear all kinds of other popping, banging and stomping sounds; tearing noises like Velcro coming apart, and all kinds of other weird stuff.
<br>
<br>
 For example: I don't know why but, for about two weeks now, just prior to projection, I've been hearing feint music like it was drifting over from a distance. The first couple of mornings I actually stopped to get up and check whether someone in the vicinity was having an early-morning party, or maybe a radio had accidentally been set on a timer, or something. But no, everything was dead quiet as per usual. This morning I came to project and there's no music. So quite why this should come and go is something of a mystery.
 <br>
 <br>
 Anyhow congrats on your progress, and do please try not to get fearful. There really is nothing to be frightened of. But I know only too well that's ever so much easier to say than to do at the time.
 <br>
 <br>
 The best state of mind IMO is to maintain an air of mild curiosity. And the best "protection" you can give yourself is to always bear in mind that you are within a realm where the uncontrolled release of thought-release-emotion leads to reality fluctuations. These fluctuations can - and often do! - range from mild to wild. If you persist, they can very easily switch to crazy and then to insane.
 <br>
 <br>
 So if you find yourself losing it, it's far far better to zip back to Physical (C1) and project again - rather than try and somehow "make it right" within the projection.
 <br>
 <br>
 Best of luck.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>

It's not my fault for the fear factor just the way we're conditioned in life with all these BS'ers preachers about evil spirits in the religion sect, I have to somehow face my fears so to speak like in one psychology book dr. joseph murphy said if you're afraid of swimming do the thing you fear and you won't be afraid of it anymore and don't back down.  I don't think anything can happen if like you said you are just an observer.  I can't believe I came again close to projecting, today so now I know what are the two most important things for success only have 4-5 hours of sleep so you're a bit drowsy and listen to immunize and tommy's vibration starter (they somehow keep the mind alert and focused in the alpha) and do body awareness exercises in the process while you drift off at the verge of sleep.  What happened again I went into a dream state guys chasing me I said wait a minute I'm dreaming then was alert then another dream sequence saw  people moving in across the street in a business place I said let me see if my higher self will reveal to me which store exactly then the word clothing store popped in.  Then all of a suddent I wanted to use the immunizing words (from the immunizing cd) to trigger my self healing (skin burn/rash/eczema condition I have from toxins in the body) I said Plus, Alert, Destroy like I'm supposed to say in the conscious world all of a sudden my skin started to itch (it was working for those few seconds) it was responding!.  Then I said I want to kick some devils butt (actually see people who are opresssed by spirits thats what probably scares me the most to see) because I said that my body tried to seperate again had my astral sight and I was getting very heavy again hearing the static noise thing again then I chickened out I said I'm not ready and somehow I aborted it I didn't know my body was doing this automatically thought I was being possessed or something (at conscious level you are in control not if you obe from lucid though which scared me).  I gotta read robert's book again or do something to convince myself this is normal and there's nothing to fear about.  Thank goodness for his book I would not known how the process was of seperating and would think its something else and never try again.

helichrysum oil normally mostly used to regenerate skin cells quickly for example if you have a mosquito bite, burn mark, bruise, cut, area where you have pain, new cut/scar if you put it on the spot the moment you have say the bruise for example it'll heal within a day instead of weeks.  Even works on moles my bro had a mole on his face he was thinking of laser surgery but put the helichrysum and the mole faded away.  Its usually diluted ie 5 drops to say a 15ml bottle (add any oil you like).  Now if you inhale it undiluted you don't need much like get a toothpick a fraction of a drop and put it under the nose or just inhale it for few minutes, it'll open up your energy centers and make you even more sensitive to energy (thats the side effect though if you like feeling electricity like static) they say for people have anxiety it helps them when they inhale it and they say it could be used for spiritual purposes.  It has a tiny physical healing application first time I inhale it my skin/ezcema spot started to itch so even inhaling it has some physical energy/healing (not a lot compared to our conscious mind if we will it in a lucid dream). Personally I use it as a marker which is the amazing thing when you think/feel of body energy or say a prayer for healing etc you will feel your body produce more current and when you do body awareness exercise along with feeling/desire you will know if you did it right cause you will feel the energy if you didn't do it right you won't feel a thing.  Also the most amazing thing about helichrysum when you try new things out say the hemisync tapes you know if they are working for you you'll feel more energy if not then its garbage no use to you, you will know it.  I haven't tried crystals yet but same applies if it works you'll feel more energy if it doesn't then its garbage.  You can buy small samples 0.5ml for like $5-10 thats all you need (use only toothpick) but this stuff is strong not to use too much but I would say its cheaper than buying agarwood which is the most expensive aroma oil in the world 0.5ml bottle would be like $150 to 300 retail.  Most meditation people use sandalwood it smells aweful (like glue or something) as a incense stick and sandalwood is much milder than agarwood/helichrysum it gets your body to produce very little electricity personally I like agarwood/helichrysum but agarwood is out of the question just do darn expensive.  IF you get helichrysum try get it undiluted if its diluted obviously it won't have much in it need to put more amount on your nose.
