Hi: I've been scouting the Internet for info regarding the Pleiadians. I couldn't help noticing you sign off your posts each time with, "Pleiadian Love and Light". I'm not really a UFO buff, so a lot of what I have been reading recently has a high chuckle-value and that's about it.
<br>
<br>
From what I have read, these people are some kind of ancestors of ours and they visit us regularly. Is this true? As you say you are in constant touch, I thought you would be the best person to ask.
<br>
<br>
If it is true, then lots of other questions come to mind, like, how do they get here, and why? And all kinds of Q's like that. Plus, and I touched on this in a post to the pendulum thread, is it possible for them to pop along and meet me somewhere? That sure would make for interesting conversation, at the very least.
<br>
<br>
I'm just imagining the look on my neighbour's faces as this starship lands in the garden, and I get in for a quick demo tour of the cosmos.
<br>
<br>
Okay, that sounds outrageous from our point of view. But if these people really are visiting us on a regular basis then taking someone for a quick trip to Alpha Centuri and back, wouldn't be all that out of the ordinary. So how about it?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

  Hi Frank,
  <br>
  I've only just spotted your post here, so I'm responding to your 'question' – but it is a BIG question, so bear with me as I try to explain the way it is.....
  <br>
  <br>
  First of all, I appreciate your candour, and the fact that, as you say, you are "not really a UFO buff" and I must say there is quite a degree of "chuckle-value" in what can be read out there on the Internet and in many books that are prominently displayed in bookstores to ring the cash registers.  Frankly, the pulp press makes a lot of money out of hyping-up 'strange encounters' of any kind and the plethora of such incidents in their bewildering diversity does nothing to gain the acceptance of the ordinary man in regard to any 'reality' that may lie behind such stories.  However the serious researcher (not the UFO seeking version of the train-spotter) largely disregards such material and digs deeper to find the real truth behind it all –and there is a wealth of information that points clearly and irrefutably to visitation in our history from 'the heavens'.  Drawings on the cave walls of the Neolithic period have been carbon dated and show clearly depictions that can not be anything else other than what we would describe as 'spacemen' and aliens in general.  Zecharia Sitchin, in his translations of thousands of Ancient Texts gives us a detailed picture of such visitations, interactions with humans, and what they did – including the making of man, by genetic manipulation, in the Edyn (or Garden of Eden, as the later to be written Bible names it) which is located 100 hundred miles south of Baghdad.  In the same area is clearly described in those texts a spaceport and also a Command Centre which the people of the time, the Sumerians, were familiar with and wrote about.  Their references to 'angels' in fact described flying vehicles that had advanced technology in the way they operated, and this is described in the texts.  What came to be eventually written, following the later Babylonian texts, was a much condensed version which we know as the Bible, and from which time it became further corruped and misinterpreted (along with many mistranslations of the original words) so that the view of Christianity bears no resemblance to the actual facts originally known by the Sumerians.  In this modern day we therefore have a very strange notion of angels floating around on clouds, and a 'God' who does not seem to do anything but be there to be worshipped, and 'appeared' to Moses with a collection of Commands to be obeyed.  The whole thrust, in the last 1700 years or so since Christianity was 'officially' adopted by Rome, has been the Fear factor – do, or else.  And any attempt to investigate the real truths has been consistently squashed.  The Vatican has in its vaults to this present time many ancient texts that will never see the light of day, and over 90% of the Dead Sea scrolls have been supressed from publication.  However, from what has been published (often at the expense of learned professors being reviled and threatened) we have more than sufficient from those thousands of texts to indicate conclusively that we have been 'watched over' by extra-terrestrial Beings (who are named in the original texts as the 'Watchers', and many other words when accurately translated add to the picture – words such as the 'Ark' in its original means 'submersible-vessel', a submarine capable of surviving the massive Tidal Wave that rushed northwards from the antarctic at that time (and which scientists now estimate to have been so high that the twin mountains that Noah – original name Utmapishtim – was guided towards as being the only place of dry land and safety).  Ancient maps have also been found that show land contours of the antarctic in great detail and accuracy – something that has not been possible until very recently to do, since it can only be done from satellite orbit.  Since the antarctic has been covered, in our known history, with ice sheets that obscure the land detail completely, then those anncient maps could only have been drawn by a very highly skilled civilization and even then only from data obtained high above the earth's atmosphere to obtain such detail.  Sitchin is only one of many who have researched deeply into our origins and discovered the extra-terrestrial link with man.  Others include:
  <br>

  Robert Temple's &lt;THE SIRIUS MYSTERY: New scientific evidence for Alien contact 5,000 years ago&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  Alan F. Alford's &lt;GODS OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM: The shattering Truth of human origins&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Le Mesurier's &lt;GODS OF THE DAWN: The Message of the Pyramids and the True Stargate Mystery&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  David Furlong's &lt;THE KEYS TO THE TEMPLE: Pyramids, Ley Patterns and the Atlantean Heritage&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Vidler's &lt;THE STAR MIRROR: The extraordinary discovery of the Reflections between Heaven and Earth&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  Ann Madden Jones'
  <br>
  &lt;THE YAHWEH ENCOUNTERS: Bible Astronauts, Ark Radiations and Temple Electronics&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  The cover of the above book states clearly:
  <br>
  "This is NOT Science-Fiction" – and the author is certainly no 'crank', possessing degrees from two major US Universities.  She rips apart the conventional fabric of the Bible in this controversial book that examines, from an expert view of Nuclear-Physics, the events surrounding the giving of the Ten Commandments and exactly what happened regarding the Ark of the Covenant (as a result of which misuse 64,000 people died) and detailing much that, in this scientific investigation of great depth, cannot be ignored regarding Extra-Terrestrial involvement in the early history of the Jewish people.
  <br>
  <br>
  What we find in all of the above excellently compiled works (often taking years of painstaking research at source) is a vast wealth of proof that very high technology was used in the creation of such as the pyramids to a degree of accuracy that cannot even to this day be matched by our so-called hi-tech society, quite apart from the sheer impossibility of even our sophisticated machinary to transport and errect stones at great height on top of other stones, each one weighing up to 200 tons.  Similarly, looking at sites such as Stonehenge and other ancient 'sacred' locations we find – according to the best surveyors who researched and wrote their conclusions – that they are all built according to what is called 'Sacred Geometry', and that they fit exactly onto a twin overlapping circles if drawn on a map.  This is precision of the highest order, and begs the question as to why they should have been sited accordingly and also along ley lines.  Other sites around the world exhibit the same high degree of precision – some, indeed, could only have been planned from outer space because their symmetry of lines in absolute accuracy is not obvious at ground level where they cover many miles.  So, we have not only been visited, it must be concluded, but also helped in this and many other things in our history.  When the reader has perused in detail the contents of these serious works the reaction must be a gasp leading to awe at what man has blithely been unaware of until recently.  I present the above merely as a 'pen-sketch' background to dealing with your main question, for it to be better understood.
  <br>
  <br>
  You ask about the Pleiadians, saying:
  <br>
  &lt;&lt;
  <font color='"blue"'>
   " From what I have read, these people are some kind of ancestors of ours and they visit us regularly. Is this true?"
  </font>
  &gt;&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  There is a misconception in the first part of your question, but regarding the second part, Yes – they do visit us regularly, although in recent years they can be said to be here constantly, encamped as it were, out there in space... around 100,000 miles away but in a 'higher dimension' so cannot be seen.  Their location is convenient for the short-range craft they send out and which is popularly termed UFOs or 'flying saucers', and these of course can dock on the Mothership.  Great chuckle-factor so far, no?  I tell you this, in stark words, because man is dealing here with the Unknown, something beyond man's scientific-based capability to comprehend.  Yet, there is a common-sense factor that should be applied when looking at things that are completely new to man's perception.  The first step is to notionally accept this as a 'foundation' to explore other 'realities'.  From that standpoint then we can begin to examine the further questions that arise.  Without that standpoint there can only be flights of fancy of what is presented, disregarding some 'facts' and accepting others.  What is required is a foothold to a higher perspective, a kind of scaffolding of the mind to reach new frontiers of its exploration, shedding conditioning and pre-conceived notions, but maintaining common-sense:  "Does this make sense?" people should ask.  If so, then however strange, it is not impossible, but only unknown to us in our present perception; and in that way, our perception enlarges.
  <br>
  <br>
  I, of course, as a Channeler, have had it all explained to me over a long period of time (I have been engaged in this for 8 years now, learning all the while – and getting a firm 'foothold' at each perspective in order to reach higher in perception.  This has been a gradual process, because it is not a matter of 'blind faith' in what I receive telepathically; instead, it is knowledge questioned until I firmly comprehended such new 'realities'.  And, believe me, I really 'grilled' my extra-terrestrial teachers with questions, diving down every nook and cranny of what they told me, to ascertain to my satisfaction the validity of what was being revealed.  "You gave us a hard time," they admitted finally.  But, finally I had grasped those higher perspectives and knew beyond a shadow of doubt what it was really all about.  I did not get there by skepticism, but rather by positive questioning and respect at all times.  When I had been told a considerable amount, I was then directed to go to a large bookstore where, to my surprise, I was taken directly to a shelf - I could not see the books clearly unless 2 inches away, so my guide told me to just run my hand along until she said, "stop".  The book I first picked out in this manner was on the very subject we'd been talking telepathically about the previous night.  I had not, until that time of visiting the bookstore, been aware that there was any such thing as 'channeling', nor had I looked or been aware of any books on pyramids, ancient texts or suchlike; I simply had not thought such things would be in print, nor indeed had any interest in those things until my guide started to tell me about them.  That 'procedure', of telling me things and then the following day letting me 'find' books that had the information in them was repeated many times, until I had a catalogue of books that others could refer to to save me having to explain the 'basics'.  From what I managed to read in those books with my very limited eyesight (it takes me a full exhausting day to read two pages maximum at 2 inches away) I was astounded at the correlation.  Quite a few things that I had been told by my guide were not in the books, though the 'general' backround often was.  I was told that my 'job' would be to help people fit the pieces of the jig-saw puzzle together, from all that was available, and adding new channeling as and when required for it to be revealed – which brings me to the present time.  There are several extremely useful channeling books that will provide the reader encountering all this for the first time with a very good and cohesive background to what the Pleiadians (and other groups – there are 5 main groups involved) are doing, and why.  This all fits together with the research that learned people have done recently, along with free-thinking scientists, archaeologists and many other fields of discipline, to give a 'picture' that common-sense can relate to, even though it is beyond man's ordinary perception.
  <br>
  <br>
  I said, regarding the first part of your question, Frank, that there is a misconception about the Pleiadians being our ancestors.  They, in fact, were responsible for overseeing the creation of Man.  Other extra-terrestrial species of Beings, below the level of the Pleiadians (who are 6th Density) have worked on what the Pleiadians call the 'Experiment' of Man.  This Earth is to those higher Beings, a "Living Laboratory" where all manner of species were brought here to evolve in this habitat of vegatation, our ecology.  Many worlds contributed their genetic 'stock' for this great experiment – and the fantastic variety of animals in Africa is where the majority of species were originally placed before the dawn of Man; in fact, Africa
  <i>
   is
  </i>
  the seat of Mankind, and early genetic experiments were tried there before homo-sapiens, modern man as we know it, arrived as we imagine.  Scientists are baffled by not only the distinct remains of what were obviously advanced civilizations, but also by the fact that they cannot find a connection between several 'early' versions of Man, and the 'missing link' still eludes them – because there were several distinct experiments, and not a continuous evolution as Darwin perceived along with others to this day.
  <br>
  <br>
  What I describe here is merely a brush-stroke impression of the vastness of consciousness in creation, a mere glimpse into an evolutionary process that led to the Pleiadians being unimaginably advanced as a species aeons before they even thought of creating Man, and even higher than them are Beings that cannot even be described to give a glimmer of our comprehension.  Others, such as the Zeta (4th Density) and the 'Nordics' so-called because of their Nordic-looking similarity (they are 5th Density) are all involved at this time working under the guidelines set by the Galactic Council (there is plenty of information about that 'body' in Courtney Brown's &lt;COSMIC VOYAGE&gt; dealing with Remote Viewing) to bring the Earth through the Transition that is coming and the Pleiadians themselves will assist, as 'birthers', in taking this Earth physically into a higher dimension when the time comes.  We are reaching the end of the Grand Cycle (as predicted by the Mayan civilization calendar), and the 'finger' of the Photon Band is at one second to Midnight, figuratively speaking, in terms of reference by the Great Central Sun and the orbit of all the galaxies around it.  'Time' is only a notion of Man, and the True Reality we are not aware of from our little corner of our play-room called Earth exists outside of Time.  All Time is Now, in reality.  Even 'Thought', as we know it, is far removed from our conception of it, and permeates everything.  A thought sent out by 'Prime Creator' (as the Pleiadians term it) manifests in 'time' like a ripple on a pond, but that thought is in the 'future' simultaneously as it is in the present.  The Pleiadians in fact come from what we would  term our 'far distant future', and they step down through the dimensions of reality and can pass in and out of any section of our 'time frame' of history at will.  Though they come from our 'future' yet, at the same time, they were there at the birth of Man.  They are our Parents, and we are truly Children of the Stars.  Now we are coming of age, and it is very soon time to make a transition, a leap of evolution, into a higher dimension not only of understanding but of reality itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  You say:
  <br>
  &lt;&lt;
  <font color='"blue"'>
   "Is it possible for them to pop along and meet me somewhere? That sure would make for interesting conversation, at the very least.
   <br>
   <br>
   I'm just imagining the look on my neighbour's faces as this starship lands in the garden, and I get in for a quick demo tour of the cosmos."
  </font>
  &gt;&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  I like your sense of humour Frank, but I think that behind that humour you'd secretly love it were it to happen – but it can happen, in the sense that the Pendulum can start people off on a voyage of discovery in conversations, albeit not 'in the flesh' with those Beings who wil be happy to open new horizons of perception, and all that is needed is to ask.  The Pendulum can be used to at least verify the facts I give here, and those contained in the books I recommend, but with an open heart to receive new knowledge the frontiers of perception will expand further and further, stage by stage, as each firm building-block of hitherto unknown reality clicks into place.  That is but the start.  As Steven Hawkin puts it, "All we have to do is talk".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pleiadians will not reveal themselves 'in the flesh' however, so don't hold your breath in any anticipation.  Neither will the Zeta, for the time being – although they will walk among us when the time is right, and that time is now approaching.
  <br>
   <br>
    Getting back to the humour (I like your style) I see your point about the ship landing (a 'saucer' not a starship, Frank – nobody's garden is
    <i>
     that
    </i>
    big, not even yours!), and it reminds me of when I had a girlfriend in Leicester.  Her next door neighbour was noted for twitching the curtains, and he dreamed of one day meeting an alien. We were invited in to meet him (he was curious about my arrival) and when we were comfortably seated chatting to him and his wife my girlfriend started to tell them about me, adding "He talks to Aliens, he really does".  I turned to her with mock concern, and said, "You shouldn't have told him that – now he knows".  He spilled his drink everywhere, and the 'dream' suddenly became reality for him.  All too much it seems, because we were never invited in again.  But the curtains kept twitching nevertheless.  Maybe he was looking for a 'flying saucer' landing in our garden next door to him.  Who knows?
    <br>
    You finish with this:
    <br>
    &lt;&lt;
    <font color='"blue"'>
     "Okay, that sounds outrageous from our point of view. But if these people really are visiting us on a regular basis then taking someone for a quick trip to Alpha Centuri and back, wouldn't be all that out of the ordinary. So how about it?"
    </font>
    &gt;&gt;
    <br>
    <br>
    Surprisingly, what you say is not all that outlandish.  And I have 'visited' other worlds and dimensions, but not taking off from a conventional craft as people imagine it to be done, but by 'connection' to those worlds in my consciousness.  Those fantastically advanced Beings do not travel those vast distances in a conventional way in any case, but instead use teleportation (the whole ship is transplanted at the destination, in fact).  The process is done throgh a series of stargates, portals in space, according to much higher laws of physics than we are aware of; thus, both space, time and even dimensions are navigated in microseconds in our way of reckoning.  It is not even possible for human beings to teleport a la 'Startrek' since carbon molecules are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated in the normal process of teleportation.  Silicon based Beings, can however, do that with ease since their molecules are geometric in their nature.  There is a further factor that might put you off, Frank, and it is this:  That in the process of Teleportation the 'body' dies at the source, and a new 'body' is created at the destination, whereupon the 'soul' is re-entered into that body, giving life to it and full conscousness.  Unfortunately for human beings it is a 'one way trip', and you can't come back for the reasons I've stated.  Life begins on Earth with birth, and that's the way it is.  When you die, your 'soul' is simply transferred to another dimension – simple as that.  So, no trip as such to Alpha Centauri, sorry.
    <br>
    <br>
    As for even a trip on a 'flying saucer', when I have asked my guide (in the past, I don't bother now any more) the reply has always been, "They're too busy".  They have 'tight schedules', she tells me.  So, despite my ability to communicate 24/7 with many extra-terrestrial species as well as the Pleiadians themselves, I haven't been invited yet, although some have – but I should be so lucky as the saying goes. I think not.  Again, if I were you I wouldn't hold my breath waiting.  But, who knows?  Millions now report having been 'abducted' for medical check-ups, this however is invariably done from an early age and periodic ongoing checks are made on those 'selected' because of special genes that many posess and which are carefully watched and monitored.  Some people are afraid of such things, but it is only in the way that one's pet would be afraid of being taken to the vet for a check-up.  At Man's primitive level, we are in fact as far below those 'Aliens' as we ourselves are above the primitive life-forms on this Earth.  They are not here to harm us, but to nurture us, and we are but children in their eyes to be lovingly brought to 'adulthood' to be ready to join them in the vastness of the cosmos as we evolve, and ever more quickly now we are learning through the guides our true purpose in creation.  Until people Awaken to that reality it can truly be said (in the immortal words of Mr Spock on board the Starship Enterprise – not entirely fiction, because that idea was 'seeded' by guides to prepare us)...."There's life out there – but not as we know it".  Yet, soon, everyone will know it, as reality.
    <br>

MAYATNIK,
<br>
<br>
I find your posts fascinating. They may be long, but the are infitely interesting and helpful to me. I'm very interested in all this ET stuff, so i hope you don't mind if i ask you a couple of questions.
<br>
<br>
Are the Pleiadians known as something else to us on Earth? Eg. Greys or Anunnaki (your information of them doesn't seem to totally correspond with the Anunnaki, but i would just like to make sure).
<br>
<br>
You say Earth is like a labratory to these species. I have no problem with this unless there is no care involved. As you see it, do these beings care for us? Does there appear to be any hostility towards us from any of these races?
<br>

I really like how Mayatnik takes the time out to answer people.  I respect people who post well thought out, detailed answers.  One reason for this is im not able to do that.. partly because of my self diagnosed ADD.
<br>
<br>
Frank does the same often as well as mcarther and timeless and others I cant think of right now.  I like no leaf's detail with the zeta type stuff too. Its one of those skills I just dont have yet.  I wonder if people who do this write out your responses elsewhere then copy or paste or do you just type it out and hit submit?  I have to admit I often cant read the whole post in one sitting (ADD), but thats not the point.
<br>
<br>
Not to change the subject, but it does fascinate me sometimes.  Ill leave this thread now with my little observation.

  EUPHORIC SUNRISE,
  <br>
  I only gave a summary of the postion in my post, since the books that I listed contain a plethora of information and are avoilable at all good bookstores and at

  <br>
  <br>
  You ask:
  <br>
  &lt;&lt;
  <font color='"blue"'>
   " Are the Pleiadians known as something else to us on Earth? Eg. Greys or Anunnaki (your information of them doesn't seem to totally correspond with the Anunnaki, but i would just like to make sure)."
  </font>
  &gt;&gt;
  <br>
  <br>
  No, the Pleiadians are not known by any other name on Earth.  The Zeta Reticuli are a completely separate race.  They Zeta have been referred to by the US government's Majestic12 as the 'Greys' – The Zeta are also referred to in the Ancient Texts of the Summerians and Babylonians as the "I.GI.GI.".  The Igigi were in their spacecrafts when the flood occurred, and they watched it from orbit.  Inanna is reported in the texts of the Epic of Gilgamesh to have cried out, as she looked down, "Oh, my poor humans!"   In those same spacecrafts were also the Anunnaki, and the 'God' Enki who had warned Noah of the coming flood, because it was known to the 'Watchers'.

  This sector of the galaxy has been designated a "Free Will Zone" were all is allowed in the evolution of the human species, without interference. When the Pleiadians refer to the Earth as a Laboratory they don't mean in the sense that we know it here on this planet; the Pleiadians are Beings that have evolved to such an extent over aeons of 'time' that they have Infinite Love and Compassion for all with Wisdom to 'bring up' their children, the Family of Man that is part of Family of Light because they've done it many times before - we are they 'youngest' in the galaxy, and we have yet to encounter off-planet species and know that Love in Reality.  The Earth is also described as a "Living Museum" where contribuiting species from all over the galaxy have 'projects' to gently assist Man without 'interference' in this process of his natural maturing.  Their Teachers and scientists study, and have donated much knowledge to this project.  And at this time especially, the whole galaxy is looking on as Man nears the time of his Transition to a Higher Dimension, a very exciting time because it means that Man will no longer be confined to his own 'backyard' but will begin to see his brothers and sister in the much wider word that is the stars, and who have been eagerly awaiting that time of 'birthing'.  No, there is no 'hostility' towards us, and none would be allowed.  Those Beings who operate their Agendas in this sector must abide by the strictest rules of the Galactic Council or Federation (over which the Pleiadians preside), that governs the Council of Worlds.   We have always been cared for, nurtured and assisted gently towards this.  I urge you to read the channeling books that tell of all this beautiful story of Mankind, and even before that of the Pleiadians..  A good start is &lt;BRINGERS OF THE DAWN&gt; to put  this landscape of creation into perspective.

  With Pleiadian Love and Light,

Hello Mayatnik
<br>
<br>
I am also facinated by your posts and would like to ask some personal questions.  You do not have to answer any of these.
<br>
<br>
Are you an alien?
<br>
Why were you chosen as the channeler for the Pleiadians?
<br>
What have you done to prepare for what's to come?
<br>
What will you be doing in the future?
<br>
How do you read these posts?
<br>
<br>
I also would like to ask a question on behalf of non-homo sapiens.
<br>
<br>
Why do you emphasize humans on Earth?  What's going to happen to other living organisms on Earth?
<br>
<br>
thanks

Mayatnik: Thanks a million for your incredibly informative response.
<br>
<br>
I do like to inject a note of humour in anything I do, but I am deadly
<u>
 serious
</u>
about wanting to fly in a UFO. I have been projecting within Astral realms for quite a number of years, so I'm not exactly a beginner when it comes to non-physical realities and I haven't got a squeamish bone in my body.
<br>
<br>
I used to consider the Astral like one huge adventure playground and would project 2 or 3 times a week mainly from "waking up" from within a lucid dream. To me, it was just a fun thing to do. A place where I could bring my thoughts to life and generally have a laugh. I've never really been interested in anything religious or mystical. More the opposite. I was ambitious and my primary focus was advancing my engineering career.
<br>
<br>
However, a few years ago, I got to thinking more seriously about my adventures within myself, and started scouting around the internet for some info. The turning point, for me, was when I became open to the concept of "guides". Since then I've discovered all manner of stuff and have spent a *lot* of time trying to make sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
Where you say:
<br>
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  <br>
  This has been a gradual process, because it is not a matter of 'blind faith' in what I receive telepathically; instead, it is knowledge questioned until I firmly comprehended such new 'realities'. And, believe me, I really 'grilled' my extra-terrestrial teachers with questions, diving down every nook and cranny of what they told me, to ascertain to my satisfaction the validity of what was being revealed. "You gave us a hard time," they admitted finally. But, finally I had grasped those higher perspectives and knew beyond a shadow of doubt what it was really all about.
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
We are EXACTLY alike in that respect.
<br>
<br>
From this quote:
<br>
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  Surprisingly, what you say is not all that outlandish. And I have 'visited' other worlds and dimensions, but not taking off from a conventional craft as people imagine it to be done, but by 'connection' to those worlds in my consciousness.
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I take that as confirmation they
<u>
 can
</u>
be contacted in a non-physical sense. As I am fairly adept at Astral projection, I'm hoping that is qualification enough for me to contact them this way also.
<br>
<br>
If so, my question is (if I may) is there some particular "sign" or "calling" I can broadcast in order to help make this connection? I was thinking of something I could hold a mental image of. Do they have a national flag, or some other image like that?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Oh, and thanks again for the wonderfully detailed reply. You've given not only me, but I suspect quite a number of others lots to think on.

  Thank you for your response.  Sorry I've not been able to get back to you sooner......My normal 'day' is between 48 and 60 hours, and I'd just done a 55 hour 'day' online counselling and trying to keep up with posts – so I needed to sleep for 14 hours.

  People come to this from all routes, some from 'down to earth' backgrounds – such as engineering, and many other fields.  Many who step on to this new 'road' of discovery do it as a result of an OBE or some dramatic Fate intervention changing their lives.  Others have been pursuing esoteric fields of 'investigation' for many years, and they too eventually find a change in direction to an hitherto not realised perspective when the time is right, and they are, when the guides deem it, ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man is adventurous by nature, he needs to be to evolve.  For the intrepid and Fearless traveller much can be accomplished in a short while – there is no limit, except conditioning and the Will to seek and embrace new horizons.   No matter how strange those new 'lands' or realms of discovery may be, we can get there.  In fact, the notion of 'pyshic ability' that some are seen to be given are innate in all of us, and only needs to be 'switched on' from where it lies dormant within every person.  First must come the openness and receptivity to all that is new, and then must come *respect* - because new horizons beyond the hills of human perception bring encounters with Beings of other worlds, much more highly evolved than us humans.  We are the infants in the galaxy, and out there are our older and much much Wiser brothers, sister.....yes, and parents – beyond the play-room door.  When it is time, that 'door' is unlocked from the other side; we have no control over that mechanism, and it is only when the guides (those beings who watch our progress and monitor) start to show us things.  At first, many believe that they are doing it themselves, but this is not the case.  The guides are effectively, in terms that we can understand, putting a 'video' into the machine and pressing play so that it will appear in our minds, or taking us (when we use such as Remote Viewing) to various locations in space or time, or even other dimensions --- they do this by a kind of 'hook-up', similar to the Internet, and we are permitted to view those scenes.  When the Majestic12 started to do RV'ing they found that they could view by simply using 'co-ordinates' given to them by another person who later took the transcripts of what they saw and heard in their sessions.  Eventually the Majestic12 found that map co-ordinates of actual locations were not even necessary – any 'file number' from their computer would do the same, and that is when they found they could view things that were not even on this earth or in this time or space.
  <br>
  <br>
  I sometimes RV, but I use numbers given to me by my guide if she wants me to see something specific.  The way it works – and can work for anyone – is to allow the numbers to come into your head... just clear your mind of extraneous thoughts, ask "Can I have some co-ordinates to Remote View please?"   Asking like this is a 'positive call' to the guides, to whichever guide is 'on duty' monitoring your sector at the time – in every sense like dialling a number, you get instantly through to the right department; in this case, the guides' RV department.   Then, your mind cleared, receptive and acceptive also, you will hear (or see in your mind's eye) numbers, one by one usually.  If you have difficulty, or the numbers come as a block and are not easy to 'read' or be sure of until you get used to it, then ask "Can you give me the co-ordinate numbers one by one please, slowly?".  One by one is usually best.  Write the numbers down as they are given to you by the guide.  For most RV'ing sessions this will be an 8-digit number (I receive 20-digit numbers to cover many other 'locations' for which I have status to view).  It will be easier to separate the numbers into groups of 4..... for example, 2018 5643.
  <br>
  All that remains, once you have written the numbers carefully down on a piece of paper, is to slowly say them (close your eyes if you feel the room is a distraction, or if you have difficulty seeing clearly in normal room light those images that will be shown to you).  So, you would say, slowly..... 2 - 0 - 1 - 8  [pause]  5 - 6 - 4 - 3.  And, off you go!!!   The only difficulties you will encounter with this is in keeping your cognitive mind out of it, don't try to analyse what you are seeing, but simply let it 'happen'.  Similarly, trying to record it by speaking a commentary of what you're seeing into a tape recorder may not be easy for some, since there will be a tendency for the congitive mind to jump in – so it will be best, until used to this method, to just view and take it in, writing up any notes you wish afterwards.  You will find that the 'places' you are shown will be to educate you, expand your perception, because the guides are Teachers and their job is to increase the perception of the person to a Higher Perspective and understing – so, keep that in mind, and you can then discuss what you've seen later with your guide - or with the Pendulum, if you do not have telepathy at that stage.   I, personally, haven't needed to use the Pendulum for over 6 years now, because I can 'receive' any YES or NO instantly through the fingers of my left hand; my ring finger moves several times in quick succession if the answer I'm asking their 'computer' is a YES....and my index finger does the same if the answer is NO.  But, normally, I just use instant telepathy to talk to my guide, and to any other Being I encounter.  Always though, there must be *respect*, because there is no 'racial' or other discrimination or bias 'out there' unlike on Earth.  If you emanate a 'positive' manner then you will always attract a positive Being, and repel others by the Law of 'Like attracts Like'.  These remarks, of course, I make in general for the benefit of all members who may be reading this.
  <br>
  <br>
  Re my remarks about visiting by 'connection', you say:
  <br>
  <b>
   &lt;&lt;
  </b>
  <font color='"green"'>
   "I take that as confirmation they can be contacted in a non-physical sense. As I am fairly adept at Astral projection, I'm hoping that is qualification enough for me to contact them this way also.
   <br>
   <br>
   If so, my question is (if I may) is there some particular "sign" or "calling" I can broadcast in order to help make this connection? I was thinking of something I could hold a mental image of. Do they have a national flag, or some other image like that?"
  </font>
  <b>
   &gt;&gt;
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  The best, and easiest "sign" for those contacting the Pleiadians for the first time – and this my guide suggests here – is to read about the Pleiadians (Barbara Marciniak's &lt;Bringers of the Dawn&gt; is excellent for this, as it puts into your mind a firm foundation to stand on.  From this you can then just close your eyes (reading it relaxed in bed is ideal) and 'feel' the impressions the text has given you.  By having them in your mind you are sending out a unique 'call' sign to them, and they will respond.  But, again, it depnds on your acceptance of that 'foundation' and a positive desire to learn more with an open and receptive mind for whatever may be given to you by the guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  When I speak about 'connection' I'm not talking about Remote Viewing – I mean here an
  <i>
   actual connection
  </i>
  that is made... an actual transfer of your consciousness by their 'computer' which controls memory and everything else we perceive to put it very simply.  It is their 'computer' that transfers our consciousness from our body when we die, and death, the stopping of the heart, can only occur when their computer terminates the life-long 'connection'.....and so we transfer complete back 'up there'.  So, the 'connection' I speak of here is a transfer of consciousness but not quitting the body.  The Pleiadians use Teleportation as a normal means of moving themselves from one place to another in physical space – and that involves death of the current body, creation by the computer of a new body in a specified co-ordinate location, and then the re-connection of the consciousness (the soul) to that new body.  So, the 'connection' I speak of is much more real than RV, but only a partial connection – you are actually THERE, where transferred to,  but your body remains conscious here.
  <br>
  <br>
  To illustrate this in action, I have the verbatim transcript I saved of an MSN Instant Messenger conversation with SeekingAnswers (SAMUEL) just as it actually happened in real-time for him.  I have withheld posting it until this time, on the instructions of my guide and she now says the time is appropriate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the part showing the actual 'connection' that was made for Samuel by his guide, his guide Mashway starts to type through his fingers during the first part of this transcript.  Notice also, that there is a telepathic concersation going on at times between Samuel and Mashway, and also between myself Karek and Mashway, and this is evident from the transcript.   I present the relevant sections of that MSN chat below, exactly as it happened for you to see for yourself (with full permission by Samuel, his guide Mashway and my guide Karek to reveal this).......

    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   what is it

   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   it's creative and 'stretching' in how it makes you feel.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   o i see
   <br>
   <b>

   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Yes........but THAT is not just an Earth object...... it is art that is 'living' in a sense you can't understand.  It actually expresses ITSELF.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   wiggeld its head in a silly manner

   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   they're trying to show you that they can see you.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   looked very "sily" its a bad word buts its all i got
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   <br>
   They  were told in advance of you coming...... but they know how to react to visitors of all kinds, anyway.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   i know it wasnt hostile from it witch i spoz was the point

   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   they were 'putting it on' for you.....
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i know THATS the word he "PUT IT ON"
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   they're "playing"........ being friendly, acting "silly" if you like, deliberately.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   lol still surprises me, the reality of it... actually really being there  lol. tis just time
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   better than them showing me there teeth
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   They're not like that at all.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   When you get more experience, you'll be taken to 'meetings' that they have...... like committee meetings, etc.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i know its a turn of speech, to show teeth means to show hostility

   DOES IT MAKE UR EYES MOVE AND LEGS TWITCH WHEN UR "there"

   shouldn't make your leg twitch.
   <br>

   <br>
   not alot my leg just jumped 1nce
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   but it felt like moving my eye was moving my eyes there
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i think its coz im new at this
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   You WERE there......... your 'eyes' are not what they seem..... they're what you think they are.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   I touched something, Mashway says – thats why I twitched..... i learnt a lesson, dont touch butons
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   You should not 'touch'...... just observe..... you can walk around,
   <br>
   everything like that is normal.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   you should feel like you've got a 'body' up there - so your 'eyes' will move normally.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   they was but it felt like my mind wa making a conection to my pysical, like I didnt have to do it
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Your mind can be 'connected' anywhere.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   anywere?
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Look at it another way.... your 'normal' place is UP THERE..... you just happen to be 'connected' down here for what is called 'a lifetime' experience.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i see
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   were i was i carnt see a exit
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   The computer just switched you... to up there, to a place chosen to show you.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   you don't need any 'exit'.... you just get switched to somewhere else..... it's what happens in Teleportation, except that here they're leaving your body 'active' here, so you can type.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   I understand.......... o so they dont have "DOORS"
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Yes..... doors are there if they want them to be there.......... but normally you just 'go' to the next place........easier.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   it felt like the large room was incomple, as in only allowed to see so much
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Yes..... that is true.......... but it is the room YOU were seeing........ not the 'restricted' parts..... you don't have that 'status'.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i see, sum computers looked incomplete, like there was more to them
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   what else do you see around that area
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   barly anything, just the "ART" ..... and about 5 aliens (looks like a mix between peiadlens and zeta ??!?)
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   all busy

   They can read your mind, they know.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   ov course lol
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   forgot
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   they gently 'tune-in'.... but mainly they are busy... so aren't listening to everything you think... only if it's about THEM..... just as you would 'tune in' if you heard your name called.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i see
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   its very misty there but no mist and crystal clear. does that make any sence at all
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   That's the way they let you see it... because it's 'incomplete', they're only showing you part of what's really there.   You can't read their minds (or talk to them) unless they allow it..... you can ask, may you speak to someone to say Hello... Just think it in your head now.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

    SAMUEL:

   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   <br>
   I told you above......... Mashway , Karek and I were discussing whether to do that 'experience' for you....... and when we decided, we started to do it......... that's when I told you ... and then you went 'walkabout'..... as pre-planned by the 3 of us.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

    MAYATNIK:

   That's it...... as Mashway says..... it's all part of a 'bigger picture'.

    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   like i said IRONIY
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   no i dont feel its a trick
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   It's not a 'trick'.... they 'connected' you... you were actually 'tapped-in' by them – so that you could really actually *be there*.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   its just my way of making it feel natural to me..... it was spontainios
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Nothing will ever be 'natural' again.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   what do u mean
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   ok mashways calming me down now ur getting me very worryied
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   I mean.....that you are an emissary for the Pleiadians........ambassadors do not use common words like 'trick' to describe the technology of the Pleiadians – their 'computer' *connected* your consciousnous to actually take you there.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   but i just acept things
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   its what iv learnd to just absorb
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   wud i have said earlyer i wanted to frow a party if i thourght it was sum trick
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Karek says, "People on Astral Pulse need to see how you describe your very real 'visit' ...... not as a 'trick' but as a reality" ...... performed by their computer.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   That's ok. I'm trying to indtroduce you to something here....... do you remember that alien...... how he stood, he was proud of who and where he was....... he was chosen from many to be there....... and you were chosen to visit there........ very very few ever have done in 'actuality' by their computer *connection* to transfer your consciousness.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   i see what ur saying

   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   So...... don't waste any more of your time........ you have a duty......... as a Pleiadian emissary, through your guide, on Earth........ to be calm........ to represent the Pleiadians.

   It is a great honor to serve

   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   You may be asked to do other things....... but your main job will be to channel..... and to use the various Pleiadian tools given to you...... one of which you have just been using......... 'connection' via their computer, taken  to the Mothership....... you visited them in actuality......not a dream, or in memditiaton...... but in reality.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   wow
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:

   <br>
   You will gain status in due couse - but you need to be diligent..... and then  you wil be able to use the computer YOURSELF.

    SAMUEL:

    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   can u use it
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Yes.  Because I have the 'status', have passed many tests that were presented to me.......You will have tests too, and when you are ready you will be able to use it and do many other things too.  A guide is always present – we are given that power only under supervision.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   You are in charge of the 'vehicle' called Samuel..... so your consciousness isnormally here...... your consciousness went there....but you were 'aware' of here, as in a dream.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>

   thats correct... here feels not so real

   I understand...........

   We decided it was the right time today, because you were doing very well.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   that was my second day qeustion
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   wow is it normal to come so far so fast!!!
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   ok mashway says it can take sum people years
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   No, it's not 'normal' to have been as quick as you have been, only a matter of less than 14 days from not even knowing the Pendulum, or anything about this.  You were very receptive – so you learned.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Plus it's because I can contact your guide and she gives me progress reports, and suchlike.  I talk to Mashway sometimes, as well as to Karek, while I'm talking to you here on MSN.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i figured
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   why do "I" have 2 learn so fast
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   You don't HAVE to learn so fast........ you are ABLE to learn so fast........ because I am here to help you gain a fast 'rapport' with your guide Mashway, and that you are now doing well.  She will now be able to work directly with you in many ways, for what there is to be done.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i see
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   It doesn't matter what a person is in this world........they could be President of the USA ........ and he still would not be able to do what you have just done so quickly in a matter of only days training from scratch.... it cannot come about until a person is considered by the guides as 'ready' – and that means being open and fully receptive.......You are !
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   wow

   but only because you are here

   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   so how does that work
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   ok she says it becauseim acepting what others wud not
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   That's what I told you......... accepting....... that's the KEY.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   im starting to learn to ask MY LADY guide as well as you now. its coming fru so clear..... its natural
   <br>
   <b>

   why does somthing i wanted to do so much (astralP) feel so like a childs game

   </b>
   <br>
   lol
   <br>

   <br>
   ordinary AP  seems like 1 big waste of time

   No.........

   Each person has to learn at their level.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:

   <br>
   hey they may do as they like

   <b>

   That's what they're here for.  Everyone is different.  Everyone must be respected.
   <br>

    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   o i c that makes sence
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Now........ you have to learn to see with 'detachment'...... but compassion.
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i see to understand
   <br>
   <b>
    SAMUEL:
   </b>
   <br>
   i didnt think there ws any relation
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   Detachment is not 'distancing' – it is seeing things from a Higher Perspective, and the overall picture is much clearer from that perspective..... and everything can be looked at with compassion, it is then not subjectively seen from any human 'narrow' point of view.
   <br>
   <b>
    MAYATNIK:
   </b>
   <br>
   I have to go now.... posts to attend to...... Talk later.

  Samuel is a 17 year old Dyslexic (and incidentally his lexographic and writing ability has improved remarkably over the last few days as a result of gaining his telepathic abilities), and he lives in the UK.  He contacted me about a fortnight ago asking could I help him as he thought he had a guide but had not been able to make any contact.  I gave him personal online tuition to use the Pendulum (I commenced this tuition of him before I posted my Pendulum article to start off that thread), and he used that personal tuition to establish contact and communicate initially with his guide.    Within 3 days he was able to talk telepathically to his guide.  He asked me what his guide was called, so Karek told me it was "Mashway", and he used the Pendulum to confirm this.  But Mashway has now turned off the Pendulum to encourage him to only use Telepathy, and the above transcript shows how rapidly he has progressed in such a short space of time.  His latest report to me – this morning – is that he has told his mother everything (he was hesitant at first to tell her, although she is a healer), and he tells me that she was not only delighted but said that she knew many of the things he was telling her anyway, and is now going to introduce him to clairvoyant friends she has so that he can learn from them also, but that I should remain his Mentor.  Samuel's mother has also now given him a clear quartz Pendulum, which Mashway is delighted with, and Mashway has turned the Pendulum 'facility' back on so he can use it at times, and it swings vigourously - but Mashway has said that Telepathy is the way forward, and the Pendulum is only for "certain occasions", because - as Mashway said to him, and I have also stressed on the Pendulum thread - it is only an aid for inne-development and exploration until one gets a guide and becomes telepathic (using the Pendulum correcly aids this speedily).  Also, as Karek and Mashway say, the Pendulum is NOT a channeling device, and channeling can only be done with Telepathy.  Samuel is now a Trainee Channeler, so - like myself, as a Full Channeler - can only use Telepathy for that, to relay the words of our guides for people to know the Truth.

Your posts are very encouraging and inspiring, MAYATNIK. I hope (really don't want to use that word "hope") i'll make some progress because of them. It feels like i already have actually. I can't seem to thank you enough [

Very interesting read!  I love reading these long posts, it takes up my dull hours at work
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
It's funny that i'm reading all this because the last few weeks sometimes when I wake up on a morning, my ears begin to hurt and I hear voices.  I talk back to them, but when I get out of bed I usually forget the conversations straight away.  It's a woman's voice but it could be anyone.  I usually become a bit frightened of the pain and break free, resisting it - probably not the right thing to do.
<br>
<br>
I've tried talking to a guide during meditations and only recieved a few very quiet words.  The name "Rainbow Seed" which i'm not so sure on.  I've been through a lot of telepathy in the past, where I would hear most my girlfriend's deep thoughts and sometimes close friends/family.  I would sometimes answer questions before being asked.  I get the ability every now and then but it seems to come and go depending on the flow of a certain energy that is flowing through me.
<br>
<br>
After reading the pendulum thread yesterday, I actually ordered a pendulum and recieved it this morning in the post (quick delivery!).  It's also a clear quartz one.  I did a few tests with it this lunchtime and asked it for a "yes" and a "no".  Both swung different directions.  I'm excited about trying more with it after work.

Wow this is a total reality check, I just sat here and read all of what was typed...took me damn near a hour and a half! lol. You know that I just recently posted a new topic about contacting aliens through astral projection, and then a lil' bit later I stumbled onto this post. I thought is this a coincedence? And then I remembered that I dont believe in coincedences..lol
<br>
<br>
Well I must say I really don't know what to make of all this stuff. I can see how some of what you say is true, and then there are some stuff that doesn't seem very true, but not alot. Ive always believed that there was some form of an advanced civilation out there somewhere but didnt know what to think of it or where to look to find awnsers. But all this still doesnt really make sense right now, and I seen you mention the pendulum method to contact your guide, but I must have missed it, guess I'll have to look back over the post.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
First of all, I would liek to thank MAYATNIK for his most excellent posts here - may there be many more of them.
<br>
<br>
I would simply like to make the point that we are reckoned to be the fifth race to set foot upon the path back to our creator, and since the other four races were clearly not of this planet, they must have evolved on other planets in the universe, those around Pleiades being at least one one of them. And then there is Arcturus of course.
<br>
<br>
There is one race reckoned to be behind us on the path somewhere in the universe.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

These are fascinating discussions. I had not really delved into such matters as "advanced civilizations" as for example, the Pleidians. So I went ahead and ordered two of the books that were mentioned in Mayatnik's post:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Bringers of the Dawn: Teachings from the Pleiadians
 <br>
 by Barbara Marciniak, Tera L. Thomas (Editor)
</i>
<br>
<br>
and
<br>
<br>
<i>
 The Pleiadian Agenda: A New Cosmology for the Age of Light
 <br>
 by Barbara Hand Clow, Brian Swimme (Introduction)
</i>
<br>
<br>
There is a lot of valuable knowledge at this forum. It fantastic that we can communicate from all over the world like this.
<br>
<br>
It will be more amazimg when we are all doing it telepathically, I'm sure.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

MAYATNIK,
<br>
<br>
I was wondering if you remember Heaven's Gate?  That incident a few years back where a group of folks who believed that they were in touch with aliens committed mass suicide.  The media portrayed it as a crazy cult.  But now I am beginning to wonder because you say that they exist on a higher dimension and the Heaven's Gate folks believed there was a spaceship trailing the Hale/Bopp Comet.  Astronomers detected no ship, but if it was on a higher level, then maybe it was beyond their abilities to detect.
<br>
<br>
Still, the idea of committing suicide like that does not seem to be very enlightened or spiritual.  What's your take?
<br>
<br>
-Do you know if they were really in touch with aliens?
<br>
-If yes, which race?
<br>
-And most important, Did the aliens tell the Heaven's Gate folk to kill themselves?
<br>
-If not, then what happened with those folks?  Were they just over anxious to reuinite permanently with the aliens?
<br>
<br>
If you have any insight into this, I would be very interested.
<br>
Thank you.  And thank you for all of the time and attention that you put in here at the Astral Pulse.

   LASHER –
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for the very important point you raise, regarding the "Heaven's Gate" people who, as the Media put it were a "Crazy Cult", because they claimed to be in touch with Aliens.  They WERE "crazy" to commit suicide, and that is the danger of any cult.  The Pleiadians stress, in all their teachings, to avoid cults of any kind, even groups that have a 'leader', because such leaders cloud and confuse the Free Will of the individual and produce the Lemming Mentality, often hysterically fanatical following of what the 'leader' says instead of thinking for theimselves.  In fact, all cults have been proven to be suppressive in what they allow their members to think or do, and are a 'closed-minded' single body that is what the 'leader' proclaims to be right, and horrific stories abound about what such cults have done to people and their minds.  Cults don't just mean the obviously fanatical, and there are many of that ilk where the 'agenda' is cleverly disguised – such as religions where the 'thinking' of its flock are very closely monitored and controlled and such groups or bodies are strongly discoured, even 'punished' if they read outside the 'prescribed doctrine', or even talk to others who are not of that 'pursuasion'.  Any group, organization or website that promotes an 'exclusive' view (and this is most often evidenced by references to 'secrets' or 'salvation' available "only to members" – who usually have to pay in some way for being a member, and often large amounts of money and  restriction to their freedom of thinking) are cult-ish.   It is the opposite that is required for Free Will, and for the individual to grow in their own way; thus, not 'exclusive' but INclusive – allowing for all, and respecting all..... that is the Pleiadian teaching, and the reason to avoid groups dictated to by leaders.  Dogmas are set-in-stone rules that limit growth, quickly lead to stagnation and when tied to a 'leader' who has made such rules there is only one Will, that of the cult's leader.  A key element of most cults is to even restrict any 'power' to those at the very top, those in the 'inner circle' – so all the people can do is follow like sheep, since the 'mystical' power to communicate with an invisible higher source belongs to the few who then issue proclamations of what the rank-and-file are required to do for their supposed 'higher-good', even if that means to commit suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  I shall answer your questions, to shed light on what really was going on with the "Heaven's Gate" cult.....
  <br>

   " -Do you know if they were really in touch with aliens?
   <br>
   -If yes, which race?"
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  The cult leader had established contact with an Alien Race, yes.  No race of etra-terrestrial Beings working in this sector of the galaxy is permitted to encourage cult followings, and there are many other strict rules applied by the Galactic Federation through its Council, which governs the activities of the Council of Worlds of which each participating member may have its own interests but may only participate with regard to the Earth project if they not only observe the 'rules' but actively assist in aiding Man in his evolution and especially in this time of the Transition, according to the Pleiadian Agenda to rebirth the planet Earth into a Higher Dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, which particular race of Beings were contacted by that cult leader is irrelevent, because they did NOT advocate any of the actions that were undertaken by the cult.  In fact, such actions were purely those implemented by the "Heaven's Gate" leader,  Further to this, he received no instructions from the time that it was seen that his actions and thoughts were fanatical, and he was merely referred to the 'teachings' and to study them carefully and think so as to better understand. Anyone can contact such Beings, but they are never encouraged to pursuade and coerce others, especially they are not encouraged to withhold their communication ability but to help others to have the same one-to-one communication ability – since this will always avoid such behaviour that is evidenced in cults of all kind.

   " -And most important, Did the aliens tell the Heaven's Gate folk to kill themselves?
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  At no time whatsoever did the Aliens suggest that those people should kill themselves.  In fact, the 'rule' is to promote living and survival at all costs.  Suicide is, in any definition, an escape from this world.  Since we are all sent down here (and in fact volunteered for the experiences that were pre-set for us to gain Wisdom) this is an anathema, and an avoidance of people's opportunities to not only learn but by interaction to help others, and share their experiences.
  <br>
  <br>
  We live in a world that is fraught with stress for those who follow the 'rat-race' on the econmically-driven treadmill that is called 'Modern Society'.  More and more now, people are beginning to see this, and are opting out wherever they can – I, for example, have chosen to live my life in total dedication to help others; I had a career in Management, was a successful stage musican, but recognised that I was simply a part of the 'machine', being used to make money for Fat Cats and that like-mentality.  As a musician my 'job' was at its core to get the audience to fever pitch, whereupon they would buy the products available on the premises.  I could charge double what other musicians charged because I had the ability to draw people in to fill an otherwise empty stagnant club that was dying, but what I was paid was nothing compared to the large profits that were made by the owners as a result of me being there – and that's all that mattered to them.  I put my heat and soul into my music, and so do many musicians – but they are exploited and the public is beguiled by glossy mogul-promotion, even to the extent of creating an 'artificial' "superstar-type product" out of somebody who does not even have any intrinsic musical ability.  Such is the way of the world, in all spheres now, and people are further indoctrinated by the Media and TV especially to conform to an "image".  As a result of young people being made to feel inadequate when seeing their idols on TV slim and glamourised with unreal "beauty" many go out and spend way over their means on products that have no beneficial effect (and even worse, adversely affect their minds) so we have a dramatic rise in society of such as feelings of inadequancy, anorexia, stress induced illness (95% of ALL illness is stress related) and even suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is, as a result of people becoming aware of the reality of our so-called Civilized Society that they are sometimes sadly drawn into cults, fanatical religions that promise them nirvana and enmesh them into an entrappment even worse than the one they seek to escape from.   Escape, and especially suicide is not the answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  I gave up my career to look after my wife who was ill with a severe Nervous Breakdown, and retired to the countryside in order to get her better in that environment.  She did get a lot better over the 10 years that I cared for her night and day till her death from other causes.  We worked as a 'team', but totally individual, respecting and encouraging each other's hopes and dreams.  That, for me, is the only way to be – as an individual, respecting always the Free Will of others.

   "-If not [told to kill themselves], then what happened with those folks?"
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  They were not told to kill themselves (as I've said above), but they were in possession of certain knowledge that I possess regarding what happens when a person dies – but I, unlike them, am very careful how I explain things in order to avoid misunderstandings; also, I only explain - if indeed permitted to by my guide (to whom the best interests of people is paramount) – what is correct.  And the leader of that cult not only had a distorted communication (because of his inability to address his own inner-development) but he was grossly irresponsible in his leadership of those people he had gathered to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truth of the matter, concerning what we call 'death' is simply that the body is merely a 'vehicle' through which we each (that is, the 'soul') experience physical life on this planet, and it is in how we live that we attain Wisdom or avoid the lessons.  When we 'die' we simply vacate that vehicle, stop operating it.  Some vehicles of course are difficult since they are heavily conditioned by the circumstances that are often imposed upon them and which they need to break free from, but never is abandoning the vehicle the right way.  The way forward is to interact and by that means assist others in their growth to make a better world to 'live' in.  This world is like a large 'stage set' in which we each play our parts; so, our body is a 'character' in that production, weaving a thread as we go through life.  The Tapestry Weave is as preplanned, but it is up to us how long it takes to weave the picture as it was meant to be.  When our part is played out, then it is time to exit stage right and so we (our soul) is 'beamed up' – not exit exit stage-left in an escape.  Because, when we get up there we find out the true reality of all the lessons missed if we run away from life, whatever it may bring.  'Up there' we have Teachers and guides also, and spend time in classes reviewing our previous life, and planning with our teachers and 'classmates' in projects how we can learn in the next life lessons that the supervisors set for us.  Often, such souls in that 'class group' elect to come down and meet up at various times in the next lifetime; so, you see, Earth is a 'practical' exam in those terms.  That is why Murder is the worst crime – because it aborts the exam that the soul is sitting, as well as disrupting all the interactions that would have been made with others in that person's lifetime – in that way, others suffer also, not only in grieving the loss of that person but in so many other ways that they can not imagine, because what was meant to be can then never be.  I know, because my wife was murdered, and that changed the whole Tapestry.  So, this job has been given to me – a new 'weave' to accomplish what was meant to be in another way, and also help others see the Truth of what it is really all about.

   " the Heaven's Gate folks believed there was a spaceship trailing the Hale/Bopp Comet. Astronomers detected no ship, but if it was on a higher level, then maybe it was beyond their abilities to detect."
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  The 'information' that there was a spaceship trailing that comet was known to some others, apart from the "Heaven's Gate" peole – and Courtney Brown was one such.  Because Courtney was author of &lt;COSMIC VOYAGE&gt; concerning Remote Viewing, and the one who exposed in all its details the RV methods of the Majestic12 covert government group, then being so high profile was subjected to interrogation by the Media and divulged that this was in fact the case, that the Mothership was indeed coming in to our system at that time.  Such information should always be balanced by background facts, and sadly the Media is only interested in sensationalism, thus it not only had little credibility with the general public, but was seen by the "Heaven's Gate" people (who also had the information) as being their escape route to be 'beamed up', as they thought.  And it was a stupid thought, due to distorted knowledge given by their leader.  When people die it does not depend on any Mothership or any such – it is automatic, and dealt with by the Universal Computer. (of which the Collective Consciousness is a part); the 'soul' (it's 'essence' and its memories are simply returned to the Computer, and re-allocated to another body or realm as appropriate.  The Computer knows where they belong, and puts them there in other words.  All this talk of 'computers' from our earth-perspective is not easy to grasp, especially due to the heavy conditioning of religion though it is even so more notially plausible than the 'image' of a God and Angels floating about in a Wonderland doing nothing all day except figuratively float on clouds.  The reality of any realm is not that different to how we interact and do things, except that the Higher Realms are infinitely more Wise and have technologies beyond anything that we can imagine from this earth-perspective.  So, we can look at that famous series "STARTREK" and if we look beyond the obvious, then we can begin to get a glimmer of what it may be really like.  For instance, when (in that series) a Telepathic Being is put up onto the 'Viewscreen' it is not a TV screen at all, but only represented in that way for us to comprehend, and it does not need a TV camera at the other end.  Nevertheless, even to such highly evolved species there is a genetic continuance of 'norms', so such things as houses, art, the outward manifestation of such communicating can be still represented as a 'screen' but in fact is far far more than that.  For instance, the Aliens have a 'device' which would look like a Chevalle Mirror to us, and which they step through in order to attend meetings and concerts when they want to interact, in every way, as participants or an audience.  Lewis Carroll knew this, and built that knowledge into his fictional work, "Alice through the Looking Glass".  And, as I've mentioned in other posts, Teleportation is not possible for our carbon-based lifeform.  The crew of the REAL "Enterprise" of the REAL Federation are not the carbon-based humans of the future, they are of a physical form that can utilize Teleportation..... that is, they have  silicon-based bodies.  They can also exist without bodies, but when working in physical space they take on a body as appropriate in order to navigate at our dense level.  As such Beings come down through the densities they move slower and slower (although still much faster than we do).  Thus, the Mothership needed to approach under cover of the comet, because it had partial density and was moving relatively slowly.  Once stationary, it could then increase its vibration and 'go up' a density, effectively becoming totally invisible to our eyes and even the most sensitive scientific instruments.  The Mothership is now stationary at 100,000 miles away from the Earth, and the Computer maintains that position and all necessary functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  SeekingAnswers (SAMUEL) was taken aboard the Mothership when his consciousness was 'connected' by the Computer to it (as described in the verbatim transcript given in my earlier post above).  He described several Alien species working together on that craft, all participating on behalf of the Federation.  You also saw described how they wiggled their heads to say, "Hey, we're really here Samuel – and we're friendly" although those Beings had a very prestigious job that only a few were chosen for out of the many that aspired to become the spacecrew and underwent long and exacting training for.  Those Beings know how to be with anyone, whether a President or the smallest child – not in terms of deferring to 'earthly status' but in seeing the person as they really are, an individual human being, and those Aliens are incredibly Wise, with Unlimited Love and Compassion.... and here to do a job to help Mankind at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  To learn more about the Mothership and how in fact humans have been taken up for visits (yes, even members of the US government) I recommend reading the book by Norma J. Milanovich
  <br>
  &lt;WE THE ARCTURIANS&gt;
  <br>
  because the Mothership is of Arcturian Technology, and was loaned to this Earth Project by that species along with all their expertise.  (Each species has in fact given their very best for use by the Federation in all of this).  As a matter of interest, Norma is the wife of the leading Computer Expert at NASA, and he could find no reason why her computer started to produce character on her screen of its own accord, and which were making sense.  This is a common phenomenon reported by many channelers, and even those who are starting to make contact or writing 'inspired' things for others to see.  I recall myself, when I first strted my training under my guide as a Channeler, that my computer would just 'freeze' up if they didn't want me to write something in a particular way... and it was not until I rethought my sentence that the computer would suddenly unfreeze and I could then write it.  Friends have reported the same thing happening to them until they too revised a particular piece.  The reason why they do this is not to take away Free Will, but as a way  of teaching and getting us to 'think' and be totally receptive  to their input rather than allowing our cognitive mind to interfere and colour what we are saying with our preconditioning.  To be a Channeler means to be exact, and not to mislead in any way.  And that is where the "Heaven's Gate" leader went completely wrong, by not listening carefully and so as a result misguided others.  First, in the Pleiadians' teaching comes inner-development, because only by proper use of the gift of Telepathy can their teaching be passed on to others – above all,  to preserve Free Will at all times.

  <font color='"blue"'>
   Were they just over anxious to reuinite permanently with the aliens?
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  Well, to clarify this for those who may not have read all my posts, we ARE in fact the Aliens experiencing evolution in a 3rd Density body in a lifetime that we 'live', and of course we return to being 'them'.  When we are back 'up there' our interest is always focussed on helping those down here in whatever manner we have the status for 'up there' – some are guides, some man spacecraft (a very dedicated  and highly skilled job that entails the crew not having a 'home' life as such), and there are many levels up through the realms or dimensions.  The "Heaven's Gate" people became euphoric about what they learned, and simply wanted to escape this world to be like their brothers and sisters 'up there' – and in so doing they missed the whole point of what it is all about. For them, the grass was greener on the other side, but they would not find the green grass they were expecting; instead they would find demotion, lowering of the status that they already had 'up there', because their actions were self-seeking and those of the 'deserter' to the cause they had been sent down for.  Shakespeare (himself a clairvoyant, and built into his plays much that was coded) said, "All the world's a stage,
  <u>
   we each play our part
  </u>
  " – and sadly, they opted out.
  <br>
  <br>
  In conclusion, returning to the theme of this post regarding cults and groups, I have stressed in all my posts that one-to-one communication is the way forward, not 'group consensus'.  We should share our experiences – and this Forum is ideal for that – but each should (and will, if they are allowed to do themselves without coercion) develop in his/her own way at their own pace.  Our society promotes the idea of 'excellence by acclaim' and unfortunately all those who are on University bookshelves are not the Wisest; in fact, a child sometimes has more wisdom.  It is very sad, that children get intuition knocked out of them..."Don't say you've been playing with your 'invisible friend' – people will think you are mad", many a parent has said in their conditioned embarrassment, not wanting their child to show them up in public.  So it is, that children are forced into moulds, to go through college and university conforming to the set-in-stone ideas that are so often msconceptions due to previous conditioning but which are acclaimed.  The 'invisible friend' is put to the back of the mind, and then the door closed even... until, one day, a person sees the Light... and reopens that door.  So, I ask everybody to always be open and receptive, for beyond the door of our conditioned perception lies a true wonderland of exploration – but one we can work with by absorbing that greater knowledge outside the frontiers of man's closed mind... to work with for the good of all, not to escape from.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, in my Pendulum thread &lt;AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE KNOWN – You'll see!&gt; you will indeed begin to see if you explore individually, with true openness, respect and willingness to learn from that unseen source all that the guides are waiting to bestow.  Yes, you will obtain some seemingly incorrect answers – that is deliberate, to get you to think, to teach..... because the answers will never be given on a plate; we must work towards understanding.... little by little, in order to firmly grasp that new perspective beyond the frontiers of our present perceptions.  The Pendulum is not a 'toy' – in fact a crystal Pendulum has always been the symbol (in its traditional 'diamon' shape) of communication between us and those on high in the heavens who gave it to mankind and taught its proper use (which became distorted over time, hence my thread giving the true origianl method).  In fact, the Pendulum is the real equivalent of the fictitious 'communicator' that Captain Kirk used in the "Startrek" TV series and Movies; their Computer
  <i>
   reall does
  </i>
  lock on to it, and knows exactly who you are and where you are.  The only difference is, that it is not there to 'beam up' anybody - You're here to live your life, and make it a good one !
  <br>
  <br>
  Some say that my posts are very long.  My answer is, that "too little knowledge is a dangerous thing" – and of what there is to discover there is far more yet to be presented, but of what I give to you from my guide, there has to be sufficient detail for it not to be misunderstood, thus building a firm foundation to stand on and survey the 'landscape' at each increased level of perception.  In order to be able "to see the wood for the trees", as the saying goes, it is necessary to paint the picture clearly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you Lasher for your valuable input – sharing thoughts and interaction with discussion are the way forward always.

Hello everyone,
<br>
This is an interesting post, and has stirred some attention in me. Ever since reading this post I have been looking up info on the internet about Pleiadians, and other alien life forms.
<br>
<br>
I've also had some strange coincedences also. For example; have any of you ever watched, Total Recall, with Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well this is a part where a lil' mutant girl guesses that he is a taurus. Well later that night when I was looking up info on the Pleiadians I found that they are from a star named; Pleiada, and that it is located in the constellation of taurus. Well its not really a big coincedence, but there are some more bigger ones. Like there is a lady named; Barbara J. Marciniak, and I was on here site reading about her studies, what she does. I read an excerpt from one her books, and it told lots, and lots about the significance of the summer solstice, and how it pertains to opening your mind for telepathy, and the other things she mentioned. Well I was born on the summer solstice. Now I think that is an alot bigger coincedence, but perhaps im just too...whatever that word is..lol. But here is an alot, alot, alot bigger coincedence that happened last night. I SAW A FRICKEN U.F.O LAST NIGHT!!!!, and so did my friend. My friend Kevin, and I were sitting back in my laundry room smoking a cigarette with my sis, and an old friend. Well my sis happended to turn off the light, and right when she turned off the light me, and Kevin both noticed a light in the sky just above the tree line, and after about 2 seconds of looking at it it dissapeared, and I just kept quiet, and calm for I knew that Kevin saw it also, so I waited for him to say something first cause he had the right away in the conversation that were having at the moment anyways. He was like, "Did you guys just see that?", and I just looked at him and said, "yeah". So I got the impression that he thought that I didn't see it, but I happened to say U.F.O when the others asked what we saw. Okay on to the other part of the U.F.O incedent. It was about 20 seconds later when we all were gonna head into another room when Kevin was like, "Whoa!, I just saw the U.F.O again, but it was on the other side of the tree line, and then darted from the lower right to the upper left really fast, holy excrement!" But this time I missed seeing it, damnit! Oh well..atleast I saw it.
<br>
<br>
So mayatnik thanks for the great post for it has inspired me to look in different places, and has stirred a new topic for me to study, cause everything else has well, gotten boring...lol

I don't know what this is all supposed to mean...Maybe it's just really all a coincedence, and means nothing, or this is all a part of a whole new area of exploration of spirit, and mind that i'm sure will shock me to the core, and make me rethink reality, and my beliefs of the universe....

Thank you for your detailed response to my question, Mayatnik. [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
Of course every one of your posts makes me come up with fifty more questions. [:O]
<br>
<br>
I guess that's where the pendulum comes in.  If I can get a good connection with my guide going, then I can ask her instead so you can get some rest.
<br>
<br>
I got my pendulum this week.  It was that crystal one I ordered.  It's very nice.  I tried it for the first time last night.  I was very tired and about to go to bed.  I did the cleansing with water and the prayer ritual and then I asked a few questions (starting with the "please show me a yes" etc) The pendulum did move for me, but very tentatively.  I plan to work with it more over this holiday weekend (Independence Day in the U.S.) .
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I would love it if my guide would do automatic writing with me through a pencil or keyboard.  Since I am not a typist, if she were to type through me with my eyes closed, that would assure me that my own thoughts and imagination are not getting in the way.
<br>
<br>
That's a real obstacle for me to overcome.  My unbidden thoughts and imaginings.  For example, when I pray for someone, I usually picture them in my mind, sitting or standing with light around them. Sometimes this works fine.  But other times, I cannot seem to hold the image still in my mind.  The image will begin making faces or acting weird or inappropriate.  It's like some part of my unconscious mind is trying to mess up the prayer.
<br>
<br>
So, I am concerned that this "party-pooper" part of my consciousness will get in the way with pendulum work and channeling and will confuse me as to whether I am communicating with my guide, or just some mischevious part of my unconscious mind.
<br>
<br>
I hate to waste the time of my guide with this sort of nonsense going on.  Any suggestions?
<br>

<section>
Wow. Well I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is Daniel and I have been a friend of Edwards (Mayatnik) for almost a year now. The circumstances of how we came to be friends is a story in itself but I will skip the big intro and get to why I am here (It's almost 4 in the morning here and I'm running on empty!)
<br>
<br>
I have been struggling for a long time now. Edward has helped me through some dark times and he's been with me through some facinating, wonderful moments as well. It has been a long and drawn out battle for me but I have finally stopped struggling and have let go. I have been reading his posts and posts of others on here for awhile now but have been in a state of confusion for a long time. I quit my high paying job, left many friends behind and decided it was time to do God's work. I struggled. I got worried, depressed, I drank, and pretty much ran away from what I knew I had to do.
<br>
<br>
The real "shock and awe" began a long time ago when I started to use the pendulum. At first it seemed hokey to me ... "yeah right" i thought. I started out with a friggen bathtub plug on a shoestring as Mayatnik helped me create. Silly I thought. Struggling to let go of my skeptism I finally got fed up and ended up throwing the damn thing accross the room one day. Weeks passed and I didn't even give the pendulum a 2nd thought. Edward would always ask me if I was practicing or what not but I'd always say "Oh i'm going to go out and buy a REAL pendulum. Low and behold time passed and I never put much effort into finding a "real" pendulum. Well one day, buy TOTAL chance and Synchronicity I ended up at a new age shop about a 2 MINUTE drive from my house! (I've lived here 5 years and had no idea this place existed) To my suprise I found an assortment of beautiful Pendulums. One specifically caught my eye. The man at the counter asked me how it felt, if I felt a connection bla bla bla I said yeah give it to me! So here I was with a real pendulum ... no bathplug dangling in front of me to make me feel silly. A real shiny beautiful Pendulum! And the circumstances that brought it to me were surreal, synchronicity at it's finest. There must be something to this I thought!
<br>
<br>
So with Edwards help I practiced. At first it was still silly to me and I felt I was fooling myself. But with time I started to get a sort of raport or connection with my pendulum ... hard to explain ... like when I went fishing as a kid and could feel the fish nibbling ... I knew when the pendulum was moving on it's own but it still was hard for me to believe. At first I asked silly fear based questions ... unimportant things. With time and Mayatniks help I learned to ask better questions. Then came the panic. All of a sudden I really started to believe. I got excited. My God I thought. A yes or no answer to ANY question in the world I wanted. It made sense. In my past I had met Wayne Dyer and he told me I could have a yes or no answer to any question I ever wanted, I just had to keep going. I wish I was that wise I thought back then! It was all making sense. The puzzle pieces were fitting together. Then the panic. I fell. I fell hard. I started to go out more with my friends, spent all my money, got drunk waaay to often, I was becoming an alcoholic. I stopped doing spiritual things. I stopped meditating, I stopped living and eating healthy. I had fallen apart. (This is when I decided it was time to quit my job and focus on getting myself back on track) I quit and the first few days were good ... I visited old friends, tried to organize, but then *boom* something really bad happened. I did something Aweful that I still have not told anyone to this day and still seems surreal in my mind. I screwed up. Big time. Days went buy and I lived with FEAR. Thinking I was going to get caught. There was no way I could get away with this. But the days came and went and nothing happened. God saved me. This was not the first time but this time I knew it. It was God showing me I need not worry ... just to let go. I tried. But I was so depressed that weeks had now gone buy, I'd quit my job, had NO money (still have 0$) and people were starting to question me and think I had lost my mind. I became a hermit. Did not leave my house much, drank, smoked marijuana, I ran ever deeper away from truth. But then, very recently, I had a moment, I looked at myself in the mirror and said ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
<br>
<br>
So I am back. I am more alive now than I ever have been! In just days my life started to transform! I let go. I had a conversation with God and told him I was tired of fighting, tired of struggling. I asked for his will to be done. I let go. I've been flying ever since!
<br>
<br>
Now. Back to the Pendulum. I ran away because of the answers I received, they scared me, I did not want to here the truth. Everyone says they want truth but the truth (no pun intended) is that most people are too afraid to here the real truth. So they hide. They lie to themselves. They run away, as I did. No more. I have started work with the pendulum again and it is amazing! Whooo i'm so excited I just can't hide it! Step by step i'm slowly losing my fears!! Amazing! Following my heart and my intuition combined with my Pendulum things are happening that I cannot even put into words!!!! Magic! It's alive like never before! I can feel changes! big changes! BIG changes! This is what I have been waiting for ALL MY LIFE! I am awakening to things! realizing things. remembering things .... i feel like a kid again! Whoooooo!
<br>
<br>
The only word of advice I have for those starting out with the Pendulum is this. Have an open heart and an open mind! Judge nothing! If you are skeptical ... the pendulum will not work for you right away until you lose that skeptism and trust! Trust in God! My hope is that I have given some of you a spark to open your hearts and give it an honest try. People have opened there minds to stranger things and found joys and wonders that words cannot express. If you believe with an open heart that you will receive the answers to your questions this is what you will receive! Ask and ye shall receive! This is truth! I just wanted to jump on and say thank you to Mayatnik and hopefully help some of you find a treasure that may change your life and bring you much joy and truth. Anyhow it's really late now, I've gone on and on so I will leave you now and end this with a thank you. Thanks for listening my dear friends and may love and joy find you wherever you are.
<br>
<br>
- All my love
<br>
- Daniel

I ve shared this story in this forum before but I will again and I'd like to hear Mayatnik's opinion.:
<br>
<br>
I had a "dream" 2 years ago in which I was contacted by aliens. They told me that they were in contact with a certain well known mystical society, and had been for a while. And that that was there big secret. Then they woke me up with a strong vibration all over my body. (The obe vibes) I was startled but did not say anything. 2 days later a mass sighting of a UFO was seen in my city complete with photos in the front page of the newspapers. And also around that time a series of interviews with UFO contactee Sixto Paz from Peru began to show up on the sunday´paper for 3 weeks in a row. This "coincidence" has led me to believe that this might have been a real contact.
<br>
<br>
I have not heard anything since then. I which I had.

   TravellinBob –
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Alien 'encounters' take many forms, from the 'dream-state' to the 'conscious' to the so-called 'abduction'.  But, of those that are examined, the validity of such experiences is found in the close correlation of details in the content.  There will always be a certain number of reported occurrences that are distorted views of what really happened, and this is because the conscious mind later 'imposes' conditioning, fears of the unknown and even a desire to make those incidents 'plausible' to others by unconsciously emphasising or de-emphaisising certain features in that experience.  When I have interviewed such people, it almost always emerges that there are additional facts that have been 'forgotten' for various reasons.  So, I always usggest that, as soon as possible after such an occurrence, the person should write a detailed account of what transpired.  In the case of lucid and prophetic or premonitional dreams especially this is important so as to see clearly what the cognitive mind will otherwise try to interpret in other ways. I used to have, starting from the early '70s, very lucid and detailed prophetic dreams, which I not only fully wrote down but also showed to at least one other person at the time.  Those 'dreams' incidentally were seen in due course to all come true in every detail.  I don't have those type of dreams any longer, since there is no need now due to the 'abilities' I have been given (and which actually started to be given to me as increased clairvoyance since 1985) and now including instant telepathic communication with any species I am linked up to to by my guide, not only in 'audio' but visually also and including 'visits' arranged in time, space or other dimensions.  In actuality, the so-called 'dream state' is a return to reality (in truth, "life is but the dream") at a time when we are not in our perceived 'waking reality'.  The only type of dream that I have had since is the 'teaching' type, for purposes of my training – and these were to show me clearly how a 'dream situation' is really a virtual
  <i>
   play-out
  </i>
  to test how a person would think and react if a given sequence of 'events' were presented in our waking life.  These of course would not be the obvious, and therefore not necessarily according to our view of the dream 'scenario', because if that were the case then we might remember the dream and just follow that dream sequence and thus avoid the lesson that would be presented.  That is how the guides work in the background of our perceived reality here on Earth, and which is not understood by those who write about 'Dream Interpretation', so my guide has asked me to address these things at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the general subject of dream interpretation, many 'theories' abound in attempts to make sense of these phenomena that occur in our 'sleeping state' – from the notion that what we eat before retiring affects our dreams (cheese, bananas etc, have been put forward) to so-called cognitive 'associaton' (a dream fragment being 'symbolic' of something in our waking 'reality', some suggest) where the mind is said to be trying to 'work out' and make sense of everyday issues as we sleep.  Both these 'theories' are true in the sense that our sleep and waking modes are two different levels of consciousness.  However, what
  <i>
   really
  </i>
  is happening there is that the 'dream' is making links or a bridge between the subconscious and the conscious, testing and even opening up the mind in some instances to new perceptions.   As I have mentioned and alluded to in several of  my other posts, a dream can be an actual 'visit' while in that subconscious state and remembered later, or it can be the 'play-out' type or similar (in which I give the analogy of the guide putting in a kind holographic-video that – which is assembled for that very exercise or experience appertaining to the person's prescribed needs – and which can actually be 'stepped into'  for the person to 'experience' in dream state, and pressing &lt;play&gt; - during which the guides also make notes!).  I have actually been permitted to witness what goes on in the 'background' as such a 'video' is prepared and then given, even to the 'lead-in' and 'tail' which the dreaming person never sees but which sets programming parameters for linking the subconscious with the later conscious mind.  These things have been given to me so that I can better do my 'job' in pulling the various pieces - as people perceive them - of the jig-saw puzzle together; in effect, I know what goes on in the "office" (as my guide describes the various 'departments' dealing with all matters appertaining to human beings).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the case of your specific 'dream' TravellinBob, it is clearly what the TV people's in-house studio jargon calls an "actuality" scenario – it really happened, in other words.  Whether you consciously remember all of it is another matter, and also what 'colouration' your waking mind has imposed on it.  I checked with my guide, as I always do, and she confirmed after checking the (akashic) records that this was so.  You are on a 'list' of many people who are from time to time, as and when deemed appropriate, given such 'dreams' or other types of encounters (depending on the person, and what is required).
  <br>
  <br>
  Where you say: &lt;&lt;
  <font color='"blue"'>
   " Then they woke me up with a strong vibration all over my body. (The obe vibes)"
  </font>
  &gt;&gt; this is not always the method of awakening a person and there are several employed if it is felt necessary for the person to awake at that time – all of which are effective, and reinforce in the mind a then conscious-memory of what has transpired.  In your case, it also formed a link to other events in your life, and also those that would come about which you could also relate to this and other avenues of exploration you would feel drawn down.  Thus, the Aliens work to enlighten - and are, as they told, you 'in contact' with many, and also seek to form regular links with them, as well as such 'societies' that are themselves seeking further enlightenment.  'Mystical' societies are in every way more likely to seek contact than others, but – as I stressed in my earlier post – this is not about 'group' consensus, but only about individual awareness of the true reality.  Sadly, groups are prone to distorted messages from over zealous leaders of those groups, so close attention and open sharing of what
  <i>
   each
  </i>
  individual gains contact to is vital to avoid misperceptions and especially the 'closed society' menality of some.  You were given that specific information so that you could investigate further, and increase your inner-development along with awareness, but always you will develop better from an individual point of view at each stage as your perspective increases, and 'Mystical Societies' or any such group are merely stepping-stones to observe, rather than become part of what is in such groups by their very nature a coloured 'belief-system', where only the few 'know' the reality (if indeed they clearly do see it).  On the contrary, what is now more and more being perceived to be happening in the world is open for ALL, and the lone-individual sharing such knowledge as is given to them is more likely to have an unclouded view as they progress.

 <br>
 The situation with regard to 'sightings' of UFOs has been especially intensely active recently in South America, with many reporting individual contacts also of various kinds, even more than incidents reported from other places at times where there has seen to be a 'focus' regarding Aliens.  In our recent history there have been corroborated sightings from many highly credible sources.  In World War II, for example, pilots were reporting seeing (and even having actual close encounters) with Alien Craft of incredible technology, and post-war (1947 brough a general awareness) there have been many such sightings that, on examination, closely correlate.  Many sightings that military airfoce pilots and radar operatiors witnessed have been heavily suppressed, but sufficent have come forward to tell their incredible encounters.
 <br>
 <br>
 In Britain in the 1970s there were a large number of sightings and actual 'encounters' around the area known as the 'Pennines' and centred on the moors around Keighley, Todmorden and Halifax (I have lived close by or in those areas – and there is a very strong 'magnetic' feel about those surroundings that I have not felt elsewhere).  Elsewhere though, such as the Midlands of the UK, there was a mass sighting of an incredibly huge Spacecraft passing over a large town there which thousands of people witnessed, and this (the Mothership) took a whole 20 minutes to pass by, and filled much of the sky as it did so.  This 'spacecraft' that all attested to seeing, was reported to have been at least half a mile in diameter as they perceived it (in actual fact, the Mothership is 1.5 miles in diameter – but this would have been difficult for the onlookers to 'estimate' just looking up from ground level since there were no relative reference points to ascertain with any accuracy the actual height and thus its true size).
 <br>
 <br>
 Though much is now available on the internet, the serious researcher should always seek the source, rather than just quoting what other researchers often offer and which may be inadequately sourced.  Very often, therefore, it is the initial reportage and books of that time of 'prime research' that give the best picture that may later, unfortunately, become hyped up by researchers going down rabbit-holes of their choice and bias rather than giving a balanced and focussed view.  Two excellent no-hype books that I can recommend to get the reader thinking and for further investigation (the Pendulum is ideal for that) are:
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;THE FIRE CAME BY: The riddle of the great Siberian explosion&gt;
  <br>
  by John Baxter and Thomas Atkins (both highly credible researchers).
 </b>
 <br>
 The above book explores what Isaac Asimov is quoted as saying "One of the greatest scientific riddles of all time".  The Russian government is far more openly interested in pursuing UFO and related phenomena than the West, and even has offices in Moscow where anyone can go in and share their experiences so there is a vast amount of documentation that the Western Governments do not seek to know about publically, and in fact resist all attempts by Russia to make those generally public outside its borders.  So, this book goes to the souce of what happened in 1908 there, and much background information is presented.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;THE PENNINE UFO MYSTERY&gt; by Jenny Randles.
 </b>
 Randles is a very serious and world respected researcher and investigator into such things, and she documents here the startling facts of the investigation into this in great detail.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the case of such books that are now out of print, the easiest route for obtaining them is through
 <a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  www.amazon.com
 </a>
 since Amazon has a large network of people who can supply rare and out of print books very often in mint condition, and I have used this excellent service myself when wanting to source references concerning ancient Egypt which were not otherwise available, and all that is required is to type in the title and Amazon will offer suppliers, details and prices which you can then choose from and purchase if you wish in complete money-back safety.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another book that is worth reading, is
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;ABDUCTION: Human Encounters With Aliens&gt; by John E. Mack, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
 </b>
 <br>
 It has to be pointed out, that such books as this are not always 100% accurate, and some fall far short of this.  But, in the Pleiadian teachings there is no "thou shalt not read", rather it is the Pleiadian teaching that all should be read – even disinformation – to obtain a balanced view, and especially to get away from the 'closed mind' mentality; the more one reads on the topic will, in general if approached with a
 <i>
  positive
 </i>
 attitude lead to further questions to explore and thus be enlightened.  To do otherwise is to promote and promulgate Fear of the unknown.  Always remember, that Love is the opposite of Fear, and if material being read seems to be promoting or disseminating fear by its accounts, then it should be viewed with caution and suspicion as to its motives (and/or the conditioning, and any inner-fears not adequately addressed, of the person writing it).
 <br>
 <br>
 Misinformation is prevalant in the world today, and is woven throughout the whole subject of UFOs and anything associated with Aliens, and 'Cover-Ups' along with 'Conspiracy Theories' abound and are hotly debated.  The whole thing is further confused by downright lies by people with ego-enhancing personal agendas, as well as the pbulication-bandwagon that seeks to make vast amounts of money out of anything that is sensational, controversial and therefore can whet the public appetite in order to ring the cash registers ever more loudly.  So, it is important to read material that is discerning so as to not fall for the hype.  The Pendulum will be found to help in this respect, so that as you peruse a list of titles it will tell you which are relevant to what you will benefit from by pursuing at that time.  Bear in mind with this as with other things, that the Pendulum knows what you need for your inner-development – and that is not necessarily to simply give you 'answers on a plate'; thus, you may find yourself reading material which (if you use your Pendulum whilst reading it, and you should do this) you will find possibly quite a few 'no' responses to what you are reading, because the object is to teach you to discern the gold from the dross and simultaneously increase your 'intuition' with growing perception.  So, users of the Pendulum should ask questions of what they are reading, to not only verify what is on the printed page but to also explore deeper, at every opportunity so that they can learn more and be better enlightened.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the category of 'Conspiracies' and 'Cover-Ups' there are three  books that I can recommend here, because they present a very balanced view with much detailed documentation from good sources which they have thoroughly investigated:
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;BEYOND TOP SECRET: The Worldwide UFO Security 'threat'&gt; by Timothy Good – with Foreword by Admiral of the Fleet The Lord Hill-Norton GCB
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;COSMIC TOP SECRET: The Unseen Agenda (Explosive Revelations of terrifying conspiracies)&gt; --- by John King, Editor of 'UFO Reality'.
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;THE STARGATE CONSPIRACY: Revealing the Truth behind extra-terrestrial contact, military intelligence and the mysteries of ancient Egypt&gt; by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince.
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 It is not concerning 'conspiracies' as a subject in itself that the above three books have their merit; rather, they excel in the background information the reader gains that is very relevant to establishing a firm foundation for viewing much clearer a higher perspective and is a summary of further  good works that take the reader even further and beyond any 'conspiracy' factions that seek to cloud or smoke-screen the true reality now coming out.
 <br>
 <br>
 Just two small examples, from the above books --- Courtney Brown is shown in context with events at the time of the Hale-Boppe Comet, when the Mothership was approaching in its tail, and those who have not read Courtney can obtain a plethora of detailed information regarding not only Remote Viewing (and all that the Majestic12 were involved with in that regard) but also full details of the Galactic Federation and their rules, channeled.  The 'cover-up' regarding the Face on Mars is also expored (or rather exploded) and a great deal of documentation has been brought to light from the files of NASA Control and the recollections of those involved at the time.  Regarding the astounding facts concerning the 'Face on Mars' and what was supressed about this, an excellent book unravels the crucial evidence including photographic and measurement data, along with verbatim transcripts of what transpired after the NASA public 'blackout' (and such 'blackouts' occurred about other things too that those "in the know" did not want the public to know, like on the moon) – so I thoroughly recommend the following book:
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  &lt;MARTIAN GENESIS: The Extraterrestrial Origins of the Human Race&gt; by Herbie Brennan
 </b>
 <br>
 This book not only reveals with photographs and a vast wealth of information what great insights are emerging from the astounding discovery of the very large 'Face on Mars', but also gives connections to Israel and Egypt among other things, in tracing our connection with extraterrestrials in our origins.  Incidentally, although not discussed in the book is the connection of the word 'Hebrew' – my guide tells me that this was originally 'Ibiri' and the Egyptians referred to them as the Nibiri... and that, further to this, it was the Nibiruans when on their long visit to Earth, as Master Geneticists, experimented to created modern man and even cross-bred with them from their own race to create the Sumerians and imbued the Sumerian Civilization with Nibiruan teachings and philosophies.  Not all races on Earth are Nibiruan in origin (that is to say, not all are from Sirius A start system which includes obviously the 'Sirians', Greys and – by connection – the Zeta Reticuli who split in their evolution into two species), and some on Earth are from Orion origins (such as the French).  The Balinese (as a matter of interest here) are from the Pleiades, distinct from the other groups – but it is all part of a much bigger picture that the reader (especially with the Pendulum) can investigate further.

 Your account of having suddenly seen UFO activity, in the presence of others, is typical of what can happen in the 'right conditions'.  Suddenly the overall consciousness is moved up a notch, and what is not normally visible to our eyes then is made possible to come into view.  UFOs have always been there, but it takes a leap of consciousness to perceive them.  More and more over several decades now they have been seen.  We can see what we have a will to see, and what is given us to see.  And that is just what happened that night as each person saw at a higher vibrational level UFOs that were only partly in our dimension's density.  In other words, you saw with a kind of interdimensional x-ray vision what is going on in our skies, and now being seen by more and more people as our general awareness grows and becomes more receptive, thus we receive into our minds that which, even when physically visible, can extend beyond the visible spectrum into the electromagnetic and further into higher dimensions.  You will find, as you read more and reflect on these things, that you will see and experience with greater acuity of inner-vision.  But the key is always to seek new horizons of discovery without Fear.  There is much to learn, far beyond the frontiers of Man's limited perception.

 I note your re-appearance 'back on the scene' after a long period of you being away, but as I have said many times to you – the Pendulum was given to you by Fate to explore and grow; that was a long time ago, and Fear, as you admit, has held you back, although you earnestly desire and have proclaimed on many occasions past that you want to move forward.   SeekingAnswers not only learned the Pendulum and investigated with many questions but passed through to being telepathic, all in the space of about 3 days.  So, when Fear is overcome that growth can be instant.  Therefore, I look forward to your new zeal leading to many question sessions that await you with the Pendulum, and for you to hopefully share with us your results in question/answer format along with your new thoughts following that, on this forum.  To progress each person needs to banish their Inner-Fear and, as the Native American Indian saying goes: "Walk the Talk".  It's easy to do if you just allow yourself to let go of the hand-rail of habituation, and let yourself float without Fear in the buoyant waters of new discovery; in fact, it will only be over-trying or thrashing about that will make you sink back and want to reach again for that handrail, so just relax and float toward new Adventures.

 Thank you for your post, and your request for any suggestions.  I deferred responding until now because you have only just got your new Pendulum, and, as you say, you intended to spend time getting used to it.  So, I look forward to hearing how you've got on.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the meantime, I have only a few comments (as other factors will arise later).  Firstly, you said that you initiated the Pendulum funtioning by asking it "Show me a 'yes', please".  As I mentioned in a previous post to a member, and which is also in the original Pendulum thread instructions..... the correct initialization should be "GIVE me a 'yes', please" (and similarly for 'no' (along with ensuring that you are in 'advanced' rather than the Dowsing 'default' mode).  Depending how strongly in your mind you project the meaning of 'give' when you use the word 'show' the Pendulum may indeed function correctly, but since not all project strongly at first it is strongly advised to use the correct word, 'Give' in that initialization, since what you are asking is for a movement to be
 <i>
  assigned
 </i>
 to you, or given to you in other words, and that exact movement will be different (side-side or in-out for 'yes' and the other corresponding movement for 'no') according to the genetic make-up of the individual starting to use the Pendulum.  After initialization and making absolutely sure what corresponds to 'yes' and 'no' it is possible to then say, "Show me a 'yes'" etc. So, I reiterate that point here for anyone new to the Pendulum, and also suggest any who haven't done so to read my Pendulum instruction posts carefully, since a good understanding of this tool's basics in the 'advanced' mode is essential to learning and, naturally, accuracy in use.
 <br>
 <br>
 I note that you say the Pendulum moved "very tentatively" for you.  That reflects your present outlook, and can be expected to become more positive with confident use.  The way to confidence is simply to use it.  Like riding a bicycle, if you are not confident then the results will be predictably unpredicatle, and at the very least you will tend to 'wobble' in your efforts.  Also, don't make it an effort as such, just take it easy and don't try too hard, and it will come naturally.
 <br>
 <br>
 You say:
 <blockquote id='"quote"'>
  <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
   quote:
   <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
   Ultimately, I would love it if my guide would do automatic writing with me through a pencil or keyboard. Since I am not a typist, if she were to type through me with my eyes closed, that would assure me that my own thoughts and imagination are not getting in the way.
   <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  </font>
 </blockquote>
</font>
<br>
What I read here is to do with the word 'assurance', which you feel you need in order to proceed.  In other words, you have a lack of confidence, due to various factors you have encountered in the past – many of which, I feel, have come from books.
<br>
<br>
Before I proceed to address the above quote I note another point in your post, because it appertains indirectly to all of this, ragarding confidence.    You say, elsewhere in that post, about praying for people and visualising the person with a light around them.  This is similar to what is done in Reiki 'Distant Healing' where Reiki energy is sent to a (physically or emotionally) sick or troubled person.  You say this works sometimes, but at other times – as you say – it has the effect (I quote you here):
<font color='"blue"'>
 " I cannot seem to hold the image still in my mind. The image will begin making faces or acting weird or inappropriate. It's like some part of my unconscious mind is trying to mess up the prayer.
</font>
.
<br>
This is perfectly normal, and not your subconscious playing tricks with you, rather it is your subconscious not sending the healing because it knows something that you don't.  In Reiki Distant Healing, it is taught that one should never try to
<i>
 force
</i>
healing on a person, and that the recipient should be willing (even if this is only at a subconscious level).  So, before sending any Distant Healing (or 'prayer', essentially the same thing in intent) a message should be 'sent out' to the person's subconscious.  That person may be thousands of miles away, but their subconscious will receive the message and respond.  If the person is not willing and receptive to healing at that time (and this does happen! you only have to be a volunteer hospital visitor to realise this is the attitude of many who are still in the stages of blaming others or similar for their 'misfortune') then the answser from their subconscious will be 'no', and this should be respected.  For this reason, any wish to heal others should always be preceded by sending the message, "Do you wish to be healed at this time?", and you will sense the response.  If in doubt, or if the picture of the person fragmentates or does not hold the energy during that transmission, then simply re-picture and say/think "I send you my best wishes" and focus your emotion into that sending, and in that way you will have transmitted energy that will be perceived by the person at a subconscious level and which they can then, if they wish, accept of their own Free Will as a 'goodwill' intent, rather than healing which they may not be ready to accept.  This Free Will aspect is clearly evidenced when giving Reiki energy/love to an animal, especially cats and dogs, but all kinds in general will respond in a similar way.  Your pet or any other animal will enjoy the Reiki energy given when your hands are held on either side of the animals head (or body, if small).  But, the animal will move away as soon as it has received enough energy, and that should again be taken as a clear sign, because even animals have a right to Free Will, so nothing should ever be imposed – whether on humans or animals.  That then, is the answer to your misconception, and any other similar apparent 'mischief' that the mind seems to play has its origin in such factors, or is due to conditioning (read about or absorbed over time).  The cure to this is always to simply free the mind, let go of preconceptions and go with what is in front of you now, with full quiet confidence that you will be guided.
<br>
<br>
Directly relating to the above quote, it is best not to look to far into the future.  You will find yourself guided in the right direction, as you grow.  And though your desire at the moment is towards 'Automatic Writing', that is only one of many ways that channeling and similar communication can be done.  It really depends on what your guide decides is the most appropriate both for yourself and what they wish to do through you as the 'vehicle'.  You may, for instance, find the 'gift' of Psychometry given to you.  This is something that I do if appropriate.  And the word 'appropriate is key in all of this, because it depends on situations, especially what is needed in interaction with others in order to help them and what they need to 'link' to.  Very often people are afraid of one thing but not of another – so, some will shudder at the thought of having a Tarot reading and recoil from the though of it (because of misperceptions about such as the Death card etc), whilst others will be put off by the thought (to them, in their way of thinking) that they are witnessing some sort of disembodied entity taking over your hand to do guided (automatic).  Some clients are not able to take the idea of telepathy or the notion of any non-physical communication, so in such instances I find that the Pendulum, or holding an object in my hand and being able to visualize through it (Psychometry) gives the client something to relate to... a physical object is moving or is in use, and quite apparently giving answers.  I recall giving a Psychometry reading to a professional Tarot reader who had called at my girlfriend's house – and even he (a professional) was shocked that I was able, just by holding his pencil, to describe in detail the front of his house, his living room and the contents of a Display cabinet that was the cause of a relationship problem he had not been able to come to terms with, despite his long experience at Tarot.
<br>
<br>
So, it could well be that a range of 'gifts' will be given to you, but certainly whatever will be given will be what you required, so just allow yourself to be guided at each stage.  I look forward to you sharing your experiences with the Pendulum and other aspects as you get more used to it.  Just remember, quiet positive confidence is all you need – the guides do the rest!
<br>

With Pleiadian Love and Light,

<section>
This topic is interesting. I have noticed in the past that there can be a certain sense of 'snobbery' about aliens, ufo's etc by OBE people, as it is perceived that the astral is 'above' such mundane things like ETs and make the subject irelevent.
<br>
I have the opposite view. Everyone dreams of the thing that would change humanity's present course. IMO the only really viable thing that could do that for the population at large is direct evidence of ET life, its transforming influence is unimaginable.
<br>
<br>
I don't have any problem with aliens per say, or the fact that they might visit us. In fact aliens are perfectly consistent with what Robert Monroe discovered about the universe, the astral etc, (which is a big plus for me as I am now an official Monroe fan!).
<br>
<br>
If you read Far Journeys (his second book - I havnt read his 3rd yet):
<br>
<br>
He is told by the 'inspecs' (his guides) that the physical planet Earth is a 'consciousness growth centre', specifically the ELS or 'earth life system'. However, they also tell Monroe that there are 'many other consciousness growth centres or schools, as you call them, throughout what you know as the physical universe' (FJ p.97).
<br>
<br>
Later, in his vision of a possible future earth in the year 3000+ he asks this question a second time (second confirmation, the engineer in him!) he asks one of the 'upgraded humans' the same question and she 'rolled', saying 'you cant count them if you wanted to, there's that many, and new ones coming online constantly! (FJ p.226).
<br>
<br>
Finally, Monroe's description of the Gathering (FJ, p.229) refers to this possible future event (3000+) in which earth's vibrational level will rise so that its inhabitants become super advanced, kind of a  merge between the astral and the physical. It makes me wonder if the earth would just 'blink out' to outside observers (ie humans living 'off earth' and other ET civilisations) due to its increased vibration.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, upon reaching earth orbit Monroe actually describes seeing a flying saucer, it is a physical object and  emits 'm band noise' (so there are people inside it). the inspec affirms his suspician and tells him that the physical spacecraft is not a human construct but has its origin 'as from your physical universe, although not nececerely your own time frame'. The inspec says that there are many such craft around the earth and they are there to watch the 'big event'. In addition, there are also beings from other energy systems outside of the STI who are watching (sti: space-time illusion, or 'our physical universe' in which humans and all other 'alien' physical civilisations reside).
<br>
<br>
So to sum up a long winded account, (sorry, I get carried away with things sometimes!) I have no problems with ET civilisations. These people are just like us, except their 'growth centres' are somewhere else. If you read Bruce Moen he will tell you that one of his own 'disk members' is currently living out a life on another planet in our physical universe. Earth is simply our own local system.
<br>
<br>
The only claim we have to being unique in any way is that there is a slight chance that we may have been the first planetary civilisation to be created, if Monroe's vision of the early history of earth is true. According to his vision, after the great success of the earth 'garden', others started creating their own gardens and they are now widespread throughout the universe. The problem is that while other civilisations seem to have progressed quite rapidly, we are stuck, which is why so many other civilisations are way ahead of us, even if we were here first!
<br>
<br>
My view is that the 'Pleiadians' are members of one such growth centre who are activly coming over here to give us a hand.
<br>
<br>
BTW, as an aside, the reports we get of rather nasty aliens may well be true as well, as I think that although on the whole alens are more advanced than humans, like humans, you get all sorts and some may be less than friendly.
<br>
<br>
FRANK_
<br>
I think you should try to contact some of these guys on the astral.
<br>
This is easier than it sounds as 'like attracts like' so people of human origin tend to belong to a particular region of the astral just as I'm sure people from other growth centres reside in their own groupings, thats why we dont bump into them every day on the astral. However it does sometimes happen. Bruce Moen says he has met a few who have come over from their region of the astral to look at ours.
<br>
the cultural differences can mean that their region of the astral may be strange, so you would have to be prepared for that if you wanted to do a tour.
<br>
I think the problem is getting an ident, without that your are unlikely to find them. Bruce Moen is lucky in that one of his disk members is currently living on another planetery civilisation at present, making it a lot easier.
<br>
Perhaps if you ask your guide?
<br>

   GANDALF –
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  I was submitting my latest post at the same time as your post, so I am posting this now in response to your post above.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for that highly illuminating information regarding Robert Monroe's work.  I have not previously heard of him, but then I'm not able to read very much with my exptremely poor eyesight, so I don't go looking and instead simply take what my guide channels through me.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am always fascinated when I come across other channelings that correlate with what I have been telepathically told.  And Monroe is no exception to this.  Although I've never read any of his writings other than what you present above, from reading your post account there is very close correlation indeed to your descriptions (as summarised, I presume).  In fact, there is total agreement with what has been channeled to me with one exception – and that is with regard to humans on the earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  You write:
  <br>
  <blockquote id='"quote"'>
   <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
    quote:
    <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
    The only claim we have to being unique in any way is that
    <b>

    </b>
    , if Monroe's vision of the early history of earth is true. According to his vision, after the great success of the earth 'garden', others started creating their own gardens and they are now widespread throughout the universe. The problem is that while other civilisations seem to have progressed quite rapidly, we are stuck,

    </u>
    <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
   </font>
  </blockquote>
 </font>
 <br>
 I refer to the parts in the above quote that I have made *bold* and *underlined*.  In those there is a discrepancy between what is said and what has been channeled to me.  This does not mean that Monroe is wrong however, since it depends on the context of the actual channeling he received, and what Monroe himself may have omitted to preserve clarity in making a point at that time.  I, myself, do not reveal all that is given to me since perspectives are being broached that depend on a firm foundation at each stage – and in this particular regard the point about 'planetary civilization' is another landscape in itself predating the Earth by many millions of years.
 <br>
 <br>
 Briefly, we are the 5th of a series of discrete evolutions [I mention the first High Civilization connection between the Sumerians and Nibruans in my above post] after other separate evolutions of 'human-like' species on other planets, and joining us on 'planet earth' are those souls that went through a period of genetic evolution on other planets.  They in turn were brought from other star-systems to our Solar System before the Earth was 'inhabited'.  That history is long and often with much pain in their evolution.  Always, towards the end of fixed periods, 2600 and 5200 years in our notion of 'time' they were visited increasingly by the Pleiadians, who were and always have been, in the background monitoring evolutionary progress.  There came a time when the Earth was chosen as a new habitation for souls, and initially 'humans' were created.  These were later joined by souls that had genetic evolutions on the other worlds.  It is for this reason that we see differences in physical appearance, and even in wide differences in cultures.  I may write more on this at a later time, concerning other planetary evolution.  But, since at the moment the focus is on UFOs then your contribution regarding Robert Monroe in general is very welcome.  And, as I said, such discrepancies as may appear on the surface are very often just a matter of context in the broader picture.
 <br>
 <br>
 So, once again, thank you very much  for your illuminating and corroborative account.
 <br>
 <br>
 With Pleiadian Love and Light,
 <br>

After reading your post this morning, I used the pendulum.  This time I said "
<i>
 Give
</i>
me a yes, please" and "
<i>
 Give
</i>
me a no please"  I then asked a series of questions.
<br>
<br>
Is my name David?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Is Madonna's Health improving? (Madonna is my dog who has a bladder infection)
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Is my VCR broken?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Is the Evanescence CD an appropriate birthday present for Christine? (my sister)
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Was my dream last night about the possessed cats a message that I should not be moving to Los Gatos in two weeks?
<br>
<b>
 No
</b>
<br>
Should I have a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich with a large ice coffee for breakfast?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Am I speaking with my Guardian Angel?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Am I speaking with the being that made the unicorn music box play when I was 18?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
Am I speaking with a Pleiadian?
<br>
<b>
 Yes
</b>
<br>
<br>
I got mainly tentative "yes's".
<br>
I was afraid that my question about my dream would be a yes too, but I was relieved to get a "no" on that one, considering we've already put money on a cabin and hired the movers.
<br>
I was a little surprised that I got a "yes" on my breakfast selection.  It's probably not the healthiest breakfast in the world, but it's what I'm in the mood for.
<br>
<br>
The last three questions are the same as questions I asked on my first try with the pendulum.  That time I got "yes, yes, no".  This time I got "yes, yes, yes".  I should probably assume that the second one is right because I did not initialize my pendulum correctly the first time.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I gotta run.  I'll try more tonight or tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
Take Care!

   LASHER –

  <br>
  <br>
  Nice choice of questions there, for a real first-run!  It is what I would expect from a balanced mind such as yours, especially with an eye to a good breakfast which the Pendulum obviously knows you appreciate (and therefore wouldn't argue with).  As to what constitutes a Healthy meal, too much accent is placed on diet these days to the extent that people worry so much about their health that they end up eating even more because of what I call the circular-worry-syndrome.  When clients come to me and tell me they have tried every diet in the book and can't lose weight and ask what do I recommend I tell them this – "Eat what your stomach fancies, because it knows best"... of course I give them other practical advice also (about avoiding 'junk food' and excessive regular intake of protein, added E-numbers for flavouring and preserving, etc) but, in general, if we eat what we feel drawn to, without glutonizing and at meal times mainly, then we will not be victims of the worry-syndrome and our bodies will regulate themselves.  So, initially clients laugh when I tell them, "Eat what your stomach fancies"..... but then they come back, thinner and much happier, and say, "Thank you - I didn't believe it.....but it really does work!"  And the Pendulum was answering in your best interests – co-incidentally agreeing with what you fancied anyway!  Just as an additional 'health tip', eat leisurely, a good early breakfast (the Englishman's bacon and eggs with toast is a good starter) and avoid a big mid-day meal (unless you are going to siesta, because it slows the metabolism just at the time when you need the opposite, to be fired with energy), and use carbohydrate (such as potatoes) for a slow steady release of energy, rather than the &lt;quick-release quick-depression&gt; effect of sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding your last question:
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   "Am I speaking with a Pleiadian" ... Yes
  </font>
  <br>
  As you rightly assume, you got a 'no' the night before (your very first attempt, due to the Pendulum not being initialised and 'attuned' to you properly until this second proper session.  It frequently happens (unless a person has a very strong connection with their guide anyway at the time of starting the Pendulum) that the first communication, or several, will be through the 'computer' or monitored only.  The response telling you that you were speaking with a Pleiadian confirms the fact that considerable interest is being taken by the guides now to help you progress.  Never feel that you are wasting their time, because they understand you better than you know yourself, and they know that you need to learn, so ask away, anything and as much as you like – and if questions 'pop' into your head seemingly from nowhere then put them to the Pendulum, and see where it takes you.  Incidentally, any members who get differing responses to this question, or a response such as that it is your "Higher Self" or similar, they should bear in mind that the Pendulum is a teacher, so will respond to your stage of progress.  You may find that different 'monitors' are interacting through the Pendulum, or that at the moment it is sufficient for you to know that, in any case, all input to you through the Pendulum comes through your Higher Self in the transducing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you once again for sharing your Q/A session with us, and especially your comments which help greatly as a background to them, to give members a 'feel' for it especially if they are just strting out with the Pendulum or are unsure as to what to ask and what to expect.   Enjoy your sessions, and I look forward to any more input!
  <br>
  <br>
  As I was writing this post a funny thing happened..... I suddenly got a flash of memory, a déjà vu... because I recollect writing this very post some years ago, and my guide has just said, "Yes!  You remember!"   There is something about this time that will no doubt come clear to me; in the meantime my guide simply says, as she often does, "Wait and see"  I won't worry any and look forward instead to whatever comes, for half the fun is in the happening and life is but a great Adventure - Just thought I'd share that with you.

Greetings MAYATNIK,
<br>
<br>
There are people who believe that the pendulum is being moved involuntarily as it is held between the fingers.
<br>
<br>
Would the pendulum work if it was suspended from a static object such as a light fitting, and one sat the appropriate distance from it?
<br>

  Greetings Adrian,
  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for the two points you raise – and which raise a third point that you don't mention, but which struck me as I read your post.
  <br>
  <br>
  You see, I could have answered those 2 points quickly and very easily just by channeling (in fact, I knoow the aswers anyway) – but I remembered that I had answered these points in detail (the one about holding the Pendulum quite a number of times) in the thread
  <br>
  &lt;AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE KNOWN – You'll see!&gt;
  <br>
  and the one concerning suspending the Pendulum from a fixed object, I had answered in reply to *Beav*.  So, the thought came into my mind to do a check, and retrieve the information I'd already given – about the 'suspension' particularly, and to see just how many times I'd explained the holding of the Pendulum and how it actually works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thus started an interesting hour or so, as I searched the thread.  I had never looked back at any posts, but I knew what I'd written and remembered what members had replied.  We are on page 13 of that thread now, but I knew that what I sought would be on page 8 or before – so I commenced my search backwards from page 8.  And it dawned on me that the thread was in need of summarising.  I found a number of explanations on holding the Pendulum and what actually 'works' its movements, and have selected a reply I made to
  <b>
   goingslow
  </b>
  that I found on page 3 of the thread.  But – sod's law – I had to search all the way back to the beginning to find the reply I'd remembered making to *Beav* - Yes, there it was, on page 1 posted the 19th of June (the day I started the thread).  So, that point about whether the Pendulum will work was actually answered right at the start, yet members are apparently – as you say – still wondering about this..... which means that even though it was at the very start of the thread it has obviously been missed and indicates that the thread is now too long for newcomers to read all the way through, and in fact implies that, understably, members are just responding to the end of the thread.  I shall therefore consider how best I can rewrite the instructions and information in a form that is quickly and easily readable – perhaps as a Main Summary with Side-Notes and a FAQ section.  This will obviously take me some time, at least a week – because I want to be able to respond to any further input appertaining to the topics I am now dealing with in the meantime to keep up – so I would ask members to please bear with me, and I shall to make all points as easily referrable to as I can.
  <br>
  <br>
  I quote below my replies which I found on searching the thread that should hopefully cover your questions  at this time.

     Just hold the Pendulum as you would carefully hold something valuable by the fingertips (so as to not let it slip and fall). There is no need to hold it ever so tightly, just make firm contact with the string or chain.
     <br>
     <br>
     Your subconscious IS what controls the Pendulum, and the answers (that move the Pendulum) come THROUGH the subconscious, direct to the fingers without interaction from the intellect and the congnitive - which normally moves your fingers when you react to events in the world around you – such as locating a pen on a line in your writing pad in order to write a letter, and ensuring by co-ordination that your hand enables the flow of writing that you do).
     <br>
     <br>
     The hand does in fact move very minutely, but this is not the same as when you move your hand deliberately (by cognitive nerve impulse). The Pendulum is the *interface*, like a speaker at the end of the Hi-Fi chain. Messages come into the subconscious and are modulated by the electromagnetic field of the body – which then is amplified and converted into physical 'energy' that activates the movement and produces the *answer* that you see. But, while this is going on, that 'link' between the source and your body sensing and transducing mechanisms (on a subconscious level) is being constantly improved with practice, and that is why the Pendulum is so effective at training a person to be Telepathic seemingly effortlessly (in conjunction with the way the guides work, because the know every minute detail of that intricate machanism that science does not understand relating to the subconscious).

    ==== MY REPLY =&gt;

   <br>
   It is necessary to actually hold the Pendulum, and what was suggested earlier up the thread by Beav will not work. I understand where Beav is coming from with this, because many object can be moved by Telekenisis, and I have seen it done several times with a Pendulum that was not being held but was suspended from a doorframe. The Pendulum, when moved by Telekenisis does not however function as a Pendulum - it simply moves. those who are adept with Telekenesis can make it give a 'yes' movement by will-power, but the movement is always slow and sluggish to get started, and shows no 'character' either in its movement so is entirely impractical, and can not be consistently made to move in the required direction in any case - and what would be the point of projecting your will to an object when tha information isn't being transmitted in that manner.
   <br>
   <br>
   The Pendulum moves by modulation of the electromagnetic field then interacting with the instrument and the movement is fully and dynamically responsive. As a point of interest, when I am teaching, I have sometime had occasions when I've needed to actually move a person's Pendulum remotely (from where I am sitting usually about 4 feet away) and I simply 'tell' (by just thinking) the Pendulum to respond with a 'yes' or 'no' to show the kind of strong movement it is capable of when the pupil is more 'attuned' to it (if they are only causing a weak swing at first, because one of the inhibors of swing is negativity in the person or lack of confidence in themselves). So I too can make a Pendulum respond without actually holding it, simply by thinking and projecting into their electromagnetic field, thus it modulates and moves the Pendulum. When I do it in that way the response is quick, dynamic and strong (unlike when suspended from such as a doorframe, which doesn't have a dynamic emf - and which, in saying that, proves the point of how a Pendulum really works). But, me controlling another person's Pendulum is not them receiving in the normal way, so outside of the occasional necessity to demonstrate, it would be at best only a cheap party-trick, and a cheat. The Pendulum would certainly not fulfil its purpose as a communicator of Truth or otherwise

I am not happy in re-presenting what is now 'second hand' information by virtue of requoting it, and I would always much rather channel freshly for each occasion.  However, I have done it this way here to demonstrate that the information IS in fact there in the thread.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for bringing to my attention the need for me to summarize the thread, which I who know it so well found difficult to find information even though I knew what I was looking for and knew it was there.  Be assured that I shall, as always, make every effort to clarify the situation at the earliest possible opportunity.

  has contacted me on Messenger, and told me about a post that was in her thread in 'Spiritual Development' called 'SPIRIT GUIDES'.... I hadn't seen it (not had time unfortunately -  due to my eyesight problem making reading very slow I don't get around the forums as much as I'd like to).  Anyway, BMR suggested I copy it into here for the benefit of any other members who may not have seen it, since it is relevant to questions been asked my those following the Pendulum topic and wanting to contact guides through it.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, I reproduce that post (by Euphoric Sunrise, 1 July) here:

     <br>
     in the "Spiritual Development" section. – 1st JULY.
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a rather timely topic. Thanks to MAYATNIK's post on pendulum's in Astral Conciousness (it's a sticky, it's pink, and 12 pages, you can't miss it), i may have just then had contact with two of mine, provided the pendulum was giving me correct answers, and provided there wasn't any personal influence etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    The pendulum 'told' me there were two guides in the room with me. I then asked each guide questions through the pendulum. What's most interesting, though, is i asked one of them if they would touch me on my left shoulder for confirmation, the pendulum swung for 'no'. So i thought, ok fair enough and left it alone. Now just before when i had put the pendulum down i felt something on my left shoulder. It was like a heaviness or something. So i picked up the pendulum and asked it if was a guide and it swung for yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    Needless to say, i'm pretty excited at the moment because this is my first contact with any of my guides that i am can remember. Of course, it may just all be coincidense, but i'm still pretty happy.

 That post was, of course, in it's correct thread – since it was about 'spirit guides'..... but Bad Moon Rising and I felt it would be good for members in this section, to share with those here also.  My grateful thanks to Euphoric Sunrise for that account.  Each experience shared is a step further in enlightenment.

I thought i should post what else i have done with the pendulum since then. I'm thinking i should post this in the pendulum topic, but since we seem to have ventured there here i'll stick it here for now.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how reliable this information i got is and i still don't fully believe it myself (it's not that easy to trust a necklace with such things as guides).
<br>
So i asked the pendulum if i had four guides and it gave me 'yes' (i had gone up from 1, so i had tested all previous numbers). I thought of ways i could figure out what my guides were.
<br>
I thought animals, and that i am very attracted to black panthers, and i've read that an animal you are fond of may be a guide. So i asked the pendulum if a black panther was my guide and it gave me 'yes'.
<br>
Amongst other questions i came to aliens. I wasn't even sure if it was possible to have aliens as guides, but i asked anyway. I went through each race i was aware of and in the end i got that i have 2 pleiadian guides and 1 reptilian guide.
<br>
Now, this information could be totally wrong. From what i've read reptilians don't seem the sort to have guides, but then i really don't know anything about them myself.
<br>
All i know is i've asked the pendulum multiple questions about this at different times of the day, on different days, and all the answers always tell me that the information i have been given is correct.
<br>
I'm actually starting to believe my desires are controlling the pendulum as the answers i'm being given are very pleasing. I suppose any answers about guides would be pleasing though.

   Euphoric Sunrise –
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  I copied your original post to this thread rather than the Pendulum thread, because this one is dealing with matters one 'stage' on as it were and not purely Pendulum alone – so 'spirit guides' is a typical spinoff, and ideal for this thread.
  <br>
  <br>
  The account you give of your Pendulum session is interesting.  It illustrates how a line of questioning can go astray and lead to puzzling responses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session seems to be concerned with you wanting to find out your position regarding guides.  You say.....

    <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
   </font>
  </blockquote>
 </font>
 Now, since I wasn't there, I can only assume that you asked:
 <br>
 &gt; Have I got a guide....YES
 <br>
 &gt; Have I got 2 guides.....YES
 <br>
 ----- and here I recollect that in your previous post you mentioned 2 guides being present – you'd checked this.  It may wel be that two guides were indeed present at that time; perfectly logical to assume.
 <br>
 &gt; Have I got 3 guides..... YES
 <br>
 ----- this would seem to be unusual.
 <br>
 &gt; Have I got 4 guides..... YES
 <br>
 ----- logical 'alert bells' would start ringing for me at this point.  This seems in every sense far from ordinary; a crowd is gathering!
 <br>
 <br>
 It is important to detect quickly when answers start to 'feel' wrong.  And the guides in the initial stages are teaching just this very often.  What they are saying as well is, "Don't expect the answers on a plate".  You are clearly anxious to find out as much as possible, quickly, about any guide that you may have.  Since you will hopefully have read in the instructions that you are unlikely to have more than one guide (and/or 'monitor') at any one time in your learning, then the maximum would be, sensibly thinking, two.  So, the Pendulum is also saying, "Have you thought properly about this line of questioning?"
 <br>
 <br>
 In fact, the ideal question to put at the earliest stage in this type of questioning would be:
 <br>
 &gt; Am I thinking about this in the right way... NO
 <br>
 <br>
 Let's revamp this questioning line then:
 <br>
 <br>
 (I'm not permitted to do too much of this, because you have to find your own answers – but here's how it might start off).....
 <br>
 <br>
 &gt; Have I got a guide?... yes  &lt; - a small swing here, merely affirming.
 <br>
 &gt; Does everybody have a guide?... NO &lt; --- very positive answer.
 <br>
 ..... sudden thought crosses your mind to ask...
 <br>
 &gt; Does everybody have a 'guardian angel'?... YES
 <br>
 &gt; Is this in the same way as Mayatnik calls a 'monitor'?...no
 <br>
 &gt; But the Guardian angel does 'monitor' in a sense?...YES
 <br>
 &gt; Is this to see how I progress with 'life lessons'?... YES
 <br>
 &gt; And does the Guardian Angel make a report daily on this?...YES
 <br>
 &gt; Is a 'Guardian Angel' similar to a 'guide' in what they do?... NO
 <br>
 &gt; So a 'guide' is completely different?...YES
 <br>
 &gt; The Pendulum said yesterday I had 2 guides with me?... YES
 <br>
 &gt; Were they both my 'guides'?... NO
 <br>
 &gt; One of them was my 'guide'?...YES
 <br>
 &gt; Was one of them 'observing'... YES
 <br>
 &gt; Is that 'normal' ... NO
 <br>
 &gt; Was it anything specifically to do with me... NO
 <br>
 &gt; But usually only one 'guide' is there?...YES
 <br>
 &gt; Mayatnik said that often a person gets a 'monitor' guide first...YES
 <br>
 &gt; This is often the case before a guide is 'assigned'?... YES
 <br>
 ----- Note: The Mayatnik question affirms the fact that Mayatnik said it, but does not state in itself that it is true what Mayatnik said.
 <br>
 ----- So,
 <br>
 &gt;  Is Mayatnik right about this, regarding a 'monitor'?...YES
 <br>
 ----- Note: No ambiguity – a direct affirmation, stating this to be true.
 <br>
 &gt;  Am I doing alright with my questioning?... YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Are you my guide now?... YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Are you what Mayatnik calls a 'Teacher-Guide'?... YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Will get another guide after I have learned things?... YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Will the next guide be my 'parmanent guide'... &lt;searching&gt;
 <br>
 ----- The Pendulum spins here, searching, because there are quite a number of variables – how well you learn, what you learn, will another 'teacher-guide' be necessary..... too many variables at this stage...
 <br>
 &gt;  Pendulum Stop, please.  &lt; --- Then Pendulum stops &lt;searching&gt;
 <br>
 &gt;  Have you been a 'guide' for a long time?... YES
 <br>
 &gt;  A very long time?   (the Pendulum may not move to respond here)
 <br>
 ----- Note: 'Time' is relative to the Earth, it is OUR time frame.
 <br>
 &gt;  Were you a guide before Man came on the Earth?...YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Have you been a guide on other planets?...YES
 <br>
 &gt;  Did you have to have special 'training' to be a guide?...YES
 <br>
 <br>
 We could go on for ages, following various similar lines of questioning on this topic alone – finding out about guides, getting to know your guide, where they came from, etc.
 <br>
 <br>
 The important thing to remember in the first stage of learning, is getting used to just talking to the Pendulum, and recognising what is 'common-sense' in order to get rid of conditioning and work on inner-development.  Strange as it may seem, when you get to exploring perspectives beyond anything we are remotely familiar with there is still the element of common-sense that should be applied in asking questions, and also thinking of analogies where something is unfamiliar.   So, questions after the style of....
 <br>
 &gt; Is this like [or similar to]..... &lt; - here describing a known situation.
 <br>
 &gt; Am I thinking along the right lines here?...YES/NO will tell you.
 <br>
 &gt; Would I be better putting that question a different way?
 <br>
 ----- and you can think of many more variations.  The idea is to adopt a 'conversational' thread, just as you would sitting with a Wise Friend.
 <br>
 <br>
 You say:
 <br>
 <blockquote id='"quote"'>
  <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
   quote:
   <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
   I thought animals, and that i am very attracted to black panthers, and i've read that an animal you are fond of may be a guide. So i asked the pendulum if a black panther was my guide and it gave me 'yes'
   <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  </font>
 </blockquote>
</font>
<br>
The idea of animals comes from such as Native Indian and Shaman cultures, and such 'guides' are very powerful to them.  I am not going to go into detail here because it is a vast area of exploration.  Let me just give you a small clue though – an animal guide is not a real animal but has the 'attributes' that animal is tradionally said to possess, and in that is much power for the mind to connect with higher consciousness.  The thing here would be to read a book, or two preferably – and then ask practical questions about the subject.  A similar thing applies in our culture where many refer to their 'Higher Self'.  It is the same as the animal-guide in the sense that it is a bridge to Higher Realms beyond our own individual (higher)self.  Communication takes place
<i>
 through
</i>
the Higher Self, and not just to that Higher Self (although, depending on the culture and conditioning, a person may feel more comfortable with talking to or through that Higher Self as a kind of buffer between them and what may be 'out there' in the at-present Unknown.  In such a case, as with an affinity to an 'animal guide' (through reading for example, and/or absorbing elements of that culture) then the Pendulum will understand how the person feels, and answer accordingly.  The True Reality is always greater than our perception at any stage, because all is relative to what we can grasp at each perspective level.
<br>
<br>
You go on to ask about Aliens – Pleiadians and 'Reptilians'.  The fact that you mention Reptilians tells me that you have been picking up on things you've heard or read.  Now is the time to clarify your thoughts by reading more about these things, rather than asking have you got them as your guides.  Obviously you have a strong desire to be part of all that's new but you first have to gain a 'balanced' perspective by reading and questioning about what you read, sentence by sentence would be a good start.  Build on the answers you receive, and if it starts to feel confusing then go back to a lower rung of the perspective and take another look from that height at what you can see that makes sense.  Only when you feel you have a firm foothold at that perspective should you move up further.
<br>
<br>
You sum it up clearly in your final paragraph:
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  I'm actually starting to believe my desires are controlling the pendulum as the answers i'm being given are very pleasing. I suppose any answers about guides would be pleasing though
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
The Pendulum will not take you higher until you feel sure and confidet about what you're learning – and then you will start to get consistent answers that make sense to you - practice along the lines of the model Questions I gave above, and apply that thinking to different topics.
<br>
<br>
The fact that SeekingAnswers has done it, and can attest clearly to that, is proof it can be done.  There is no race to 'get there' in this, and each person has matters of inner-deveolopment that take priority each of those different in themselves.  So, just keep asking questions - as many as you possibly can - and enjoy the journey!
<br>
<br>
With Pleiadian Love and Light,

The questioning i used was "Do i have at least one personal guide in total?" and so on until i got to five, where it gave me a no. So yes that would probably be the same as you assumed. As i said before, i'm a bit suspicious of the answers i'm getting. I am leaning towards the idea that i'm getting incorrect answers because of either my desire/excitement, and/or my questioning. I'll work on it.
<br>
Thanks for the guidance ([

<section>
MAYATNIK, and all.
<br>
I dont't wish to ghange the current topic but just to say thanks and
<br>
I have, today, finished reading the book you recommended in an early post (I think page 1)"Bringers Of The Dawn". I would like to thank you for the recommendation. It has bought me up to speed on all that has happened, is happening and going to happen (probable).
<br>
I  would summarize the book as a concise and profoundly informative overview of the planets history, and am quiet amazed at the many parallels (yet with a different perspective) to other authors I've read over the past year on my search for personal development. To mention just 3, the first one that came to mind was Carlos Castonadas last book he wrote, which I cant remember the name now, in it he was describing these non-physical beings which feed on emotions, fear and anxiety etc. hence the need to manufacture fear etc.(lower frequency stuff). Then  they(Pleiadian)  refer all the time, to frequency, both of sound and light, which reminded me about what the Munro Institute and Bruce Moen have been discovering and documenting as is also what the Astral Pulse is about (generally speaking)
<br>
We are ment to be here!!!.
<br>
<br>
I was very pleased to read and understand the purpose of the 12 chakra centers as till now thought it a daunting task to attempt to study sensibly and grasp clearly.
<br>
<br>
Their (Pleiadian) constant emphasis on our (human) potential ability to become the  interdimensional and multidimensional beings, that we are (again) ment to become, is very exciting.
<br>
I was not expecting the surprise I got at the second last chapter (21) when thy give a formula, INTENTION - BREATHING- PILLAR of LIGHT and SPINNING for those who wish to accelerate. If I read this correctly then there is a very simple method of perhaps
<br>
going astral at my finger tips (thumb). I intend to practice this to see what happens. If its a goody I'll post the full version.
<br>
<br>
Ive enjoyed the book immensely and will be reading it again.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Mayatnik and all on Astral Pulse

Quite interesting - tonight all the things i was questioning seemed to link each other - and this with the help of our (astral pulse members) friend MAYATNIK - thanks again MAYATNIK.
<br>
<br>
Until this day (or yesterday it`s 1:25 PM right now) i was reading topics only from &lt;&lt;Out of Body and Astral Experiences&gt;&gt; forums.. But yesterday i just kinda` want to see more of this site`s forum (i`m a regular user of this site for a month or two - and studying AP for about several years - but not so active until 2 months now) and I found &lt;&lt;Astral Consciousness&gt;&gt; - and it was impossible to miss the 13 pages topic "AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE KNOWN - You'll see !" - i read some posts and after that (i thought it was nothing interesting - i was just scrolling
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
) I went back to the &lt;&lt;Astral Consciousness&gt;&gt; page and i saw something that OPENED my mind and eyes !!! I saw Franks topic "Question for Mayatnik" and it seemed impossible to me ! Why you might ask.. well because Frank is a more spiritual advanced person in my eyes (and in every newbie eyes i guess) and usually he answeared topics like "Question for Frank" and now he was posting a topic "Question for Mayatnik - by Frank" !!! Then I said in my mind: "This MAYATNIK fellow must KNOW SOMETHING" So I began reading (i still have to read "AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE KNOWN - You'll see !" topic) Anyways thank you Frank for all your help..
<br>
<br>
I haven`t tried the technique yet but i certainly will !
<br>
<br>
Another thing I would like to mention is while reading "Question for Mayatnik" i realised i made progress in my attempt to AP - i got to partial paralysis

And my question is this: What Does AP has to do with EVERYTHING (with the universal truth and all) ?? I mean is it a waste of time ? Or is it another method ?
<br>
<br>
This is all - i won`t ask other questions although i have a LOT of them - but as you said MAYATNIK I`ll discover the truth myself (hope i`ll be able to do it soon) for the sake of the journey

Tao: Thank you ever so much for your kind comments.

While I have quite a lot of experience at Astral projection, in the general scheme of things I'm just a tiny fish in a very large pond. Mankind is bordering on discovering a whole new "science". And while we
<u>
 all

, in our own way, are the forerunners of that... in a hundred years or so, people are going to look back and laugh at how limited we all were.

What I wanted to ask you Frank - have you developed a kind of BIG curiousity for "the pendulum thing" ? Or am I the only one who thinks that this is the key to Everything ?
<br>
<br>
What I mean is do you find "the pendulum" more important then Astral Travel ?  - because I have kind of "put aside" the AP exercises recently (thinking that "the pendulum" is more important)..
<br>
<br>
PS: I wanted to ask MAYATNIK something too.. but i saw that he answears more on the other topic (that`s the best way) and I shall post my questions there.. (after i finish reading all that has been said)..

All the best,

The direct answer to your question is, no.
<br>
<br>
However, as a result of Mayatnik's posts, I

 have
</u>
developed a BIG curiosity for "the Pleiadian thing". To the extent where I am currently in the process of working towards attempting contact within non-physical realms.

I have already posted my little experience on another post but maybe it has something to do with this, so Mayatnik could you tell me if what i saw looks like some E.T. guide ? Here it is :
<br>
<br>
"I was in my bed, but light was still on. Eyes closed, i was totally relaxed and was thinking very hard "i want to meet my guide, i want to meet my guide ..." over and over in my head. Little by little, in my mind, i saw i was traveling in some kind of tunnel (i wasn't APing, but in my body, in was just in my mind) with squares on it, it was like this for about a minute, and then i was in the air, a pinky sky with clouds and a big mecanism of wheels like in a clock behind the clouds, and suddenly a horrible face came out of one of the cloud, the same type you describe i think : it was humanoid, smiling, but without hair, with pink skin, a very small mouth, kinda like a "grey" alien but with normal eyes. I was really afraid and get back in a normal consciousness state immediately, thinking it was a neg or my imagination. Sh*t, it might have been my guide ... As I was wanting to see him ... Hope he didn't take it bad hehe
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
Do you think it could be that ?"
<br>
<br>
I let you be the judge ...
<br>
I have tried to do it again but i couldn't success in creating the tunnel. I'll try again tonight with all the new info i get from you.
<br>
<br>
Thanks

 It's late at night here, and I notice your are in France – so whether you'll see this before bedtime I don't know.  But, I'll try to get it on the boards as quickly as I can, with my comments you ask for.
 <br>
 <br>
 First of all, the 'tunnel' you mention is partly to do with a particular 'state' where the natural chemicals of the brain free the conscious mind... so it just happens when conditions are right.
 <br>
 <br>
 People actually use various 'methods' to try to induce an 'altered state' of consciousness, and some of those methods are on these forums.  They work, or do not work, depending on the individual.  There is a place for all such methods in this modern world where stress and conditioning block natural access to the Higher Realms.  In fact, we are all born with the innate ability to do it – then it is often knocked out of us while we are still children, and we are forced to 'conform'.  For many, conditioning is hard to break, so a particular 'method' often gives the person something to latch onto for this, and the 'believing' in the method helps as much as the method itself.  but, being able to just 'do it' naturally is the best, and the easiest.  I just 'go' when I want to...and you seem to have the ability to let yourself be an a sufficiently relaxed and natural state as to be able to do this.  The natural way is always the best, and will always work if a person is sufficiently relaxed and can shed conditioning and Fear.
 <br>
 <br>
 What happened was real, as the 'tunnel' progressed to the landscape.  It wasn't imagination (often thinking it is imagination is the biggest problem that people have, then the conscious mind takes over and snaps them out of it; the way is just to go with it).  So it was, that a 'face' was presented to you.  This is typical, and thousands of people report encounters in exactly this way so there is too much correlation for it to just be a picture; it was presented for you to see.
 <br>
 <br>
 From what you describe it is clear to me in my experience (and my guide affirms what I am saying here also) that you were being presented with a 'test'.  Why should you be presented with a test in this way?  One of the reasons is to get you to think about your notion of 'aliens'.  The 'face' presented to you was not a normal 'Grey' type species, but there were similarities (small mouth etc).  The guides can present themselves in any form they choose, but that 'face' was chosen obviously, and it would seem to be to test your Fear.  Fear is something to be overcome.  The next time it happens, the way forward is to just remain calm and wait to see if the 'Being' (however presented) speaks to you, which will be 'heard' in your mind).  Or, you can just say, "Hello" perfectly naturally, as a greeting.  And see what transpires from there.  You are simply being allowed to have this experience through your mind, and there is nothing in that which can harm you.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have just quickly dashed this off, and I will leave it at that for now so that you may be able to read this tonight.
 <br>
 <br>
 Look forward to hearing more from you on this.
 <br>
 <br>
 With Pleiadian Love and Light,
 <br>
 MAYATNIK.

My problem is that i tried again to create the tunnel but i can't as clearly. The closer i get to it took me 1h30 a few days ago, i saw a bit of the tunnel but at the end was an image of an old military parade (begining of the XXth cent.) which seems familiar but i don't know why and it vanished in a matter of seconds (about 10)... I think my problem might be that i am not "mentally" relaxed enough, as i know what i am expecting to see (last time i just wanted to relax and was thinking of nothing, just following the tunnel). I'll try again tonight if i can and i'll tell you what happen. Does it help if i call my guide in my head ?

What do you mean by 'my guide affirms what i am saying here also" ? On my particular experience or in general ? However, thanks for this explanation, i understand better what was happening now (i feard a long time to have encountered a "neg" that was attached to me) !
<br>
Was this face "my" guide or any of them ? I know i won't be afraid anymore now, i'm confident and want to experience talking with my guide(s).

<br>
<br>
Well it seems i have failed the test [V] Is this problematic ? Would i have another chance in the near future ? Does it depend on me or on them ? Could they be disapointed by my reaction ?
<br>
When you say i'll hear the guide talk, you mean physically i'll hear words or i'll just have an impression of knowing what he wants to say to me ? How would i make the difference between him and me talking in my head ? Is it very clearly another voice ?
<br>
<br>
Do you think that starting to use the pendulum could be good for me as i have seemingly met "face to face" one of the guides ? Maybe they'll answer my questions and i'll have some instructions for the next time ... ?
<br>
<br>
Btw, i have a question that might seem odd but .. what exactly does our guide do for us ? I mean does he really guide us in our everyday life or is it more like someone we know and chat with so we tend to elevate ourselves spiritually with the information he gives to us ?

Well i have done a little search on the various ET races you're talking about, and i've found that the greys (and the reptilien) were enemies to us, is that right ? Then how could they be our guides ? Or do only the pleiadians are our guides ?

Greetings Kalonek,
<br>
<br>
<br>
I understand your concern. You have got to realise that much of what you will read (especially on the internet) is not to be trusted.
<br>
There are many charlatans around who try to teach people wrong information. Whether they know it is wrong or beleive it to be correct is irrelevant, it is still wrong.
<br>
<br>
With the pendulum however, you have in your hands a tool to verify any information you read and with it you will find only the truth. I suggest you check everything you read, including this post and others here with your pendulum.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Dave

     Parmenion, is a great example of how quickly one can grow with the pendulum as I was telling Mayatnik last night, his questioning skils are superb and he has learned how to quickly jump from one string of questions to another to get to the answers he is looking for and confirming them as well. Take a look at some of his Q &amp; A sessions they are fabulous learning tools.

i have started using the pendulum, and discovered i had 5 guides : 3 pleiadians, my higher self and another one from the higher realms. But the pendulum keeps telling me i'm not using it right, though i do exactly what is said by Mayatnik. And i don't know if it's normal that the pendulum just move from an inch at max. I never know if i'm not interfering with it with little "pushes" ... Big dilemas for me ... Maybe you could check quickly with your own pendulum if i'm doing things right or not ... Would be great (but i know you are busy now).

Thanks anyway for you answer !

<section>
<b>
 Kalonek,
</b>
<br>
<br>
I had the exact same problems with worrying whether I was interfering or giving little nudges in the direction I
<i>
 though
</i>
the answer should be. In the begining I'm sure it happened from time to time but here are some tips I used to get past this stage of doubt.
<br>
<br>
My first tip is simple.
<font size='"1"'>
 Practice!
</font>
<font size='"2"'>
 Practice!
</font>
<font size='"3"'>
 Practice!
</font>
The more you do it the more you will get to know your pendulum and the more
<i>
 alive
</i>
it will become to you.
<br>
<br>
Second tip is to relax before begining a session ... at least when you are a novice. This worked for me and I found it helped when I wasn't anxious or stressed out. I'd usualy take a hot bath beforehand and maybe a little meditation or deep breathing to help clear my mind.
<br>
<br>
Then just learn to let the pendulum dangle freely in front of you and try to clear your mind of any doubts or fear that might pop in.
<br>
<br>
For me it took awhile to find a point of focus or something to hold my concentration on but with time I found the bottom
<i>
 point
</i>
of my pendulum (it looks like a purple sharks tooth) was the perfect area of concentration for me.
<br>
<br>
Then I just let my mind clear and keep focusing on the area, eventually it begins to swing in a circular motion slowly, slowly and as long as I keep my mind clear it speeds up and then it will either begin to swing back and forth or side to side ... once I got to know my pendulum I could see the tip or point that I was focused on nibble. Almost like when you are fishing. You can be holding the rod in your hands, even if you swing the string, shake the reel or the whole rod itself while talking to dad or just day dreaming about catching the big one, once you've done enough fishing you will just KNOW when you have a bite. It is unmistakable. This is the same feeling I get with the pendulum. I notice a slight
<i>
 bite
</i>
and then it starts to swing in that direction. Eventually when my focus became stronger and I learned to have faith a white glow started to appear around the
<i>
 shark's tooth
</i>
(I have no idea what the proper term would be) [
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
] Sometimes it will just continue to swing round and round and round and I have learned that this is
<i>
 search mode
</i>
and if your question is poor it may search forever and ever or just come to a complete stop.
<br>
<br>
Just thought I would throw in my 2 cents in and give you some ideas. I am definately no pro but these things have worked for me so if they bring even a grain of truth and learning to your lessons I am greatful. Take care.
<br>
<br>
-All my love

 Hello Karek. May I ask a couple of questions about Kalonek at this time?  YES

 Thank-you.
 <br>
 Is Kalonek interfering with the pendulum withlittle "pushes"?  YES
 <br>
 Is this a big problem?  NO
 <br>
 If Kalonek lets go and relaxes and tries not to force things, will this problem be corrected?  YES
 <br>
 With practise, will Kalonek do very well with the pendulum?  YES
</font>
<br>
<br>
And dont worry about the size of the swing. An inch is fine. The length of swing will vary as you progress with the pendulum. When it does, why not ask it why?
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Dave

<section>
Mayatnik, you mentioned the term Healthy diet, which got me interested in replying. Do the Pleiadians you talk about have opinions on ethics, such as killing other beings for food? A. Einstein has said "Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet". I'm a vegan and I have pretty much the same opinion. In the east there are plenty of teachings which promote vegetarism as one of the primary leverages to raise the level of consciousness. It's basically thinking about the wellbeing and survival of others before yourself, also a way to diminish one's ego.
<br>
<br>
What I have understood from a few sources is that these higher stages of consciousness, among or thru meditation and yoga for example, are quite essential in communicating with 'aliens' and the like, 'higher beings'. Of course, I might be wrong, these are just my subtle primordial impressions on the subject.

I will give it more thought in the future.
<br>
<br>
Edit: I suppose this should go to Parmenion.

<section>
Greetings Joyrex,
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to take the opportunity to respond to your excellent questions. This is a topic that I have been giving much consideration to and now, with the pendulum, I have the means to find out the truth of the matter. Posted below for your consideration  are the questions and answers from my session with Karek using the pendulum.
<br>
<br>
** Any notes I have made for this post will be typed in green
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello Karek. May I please ask you some questions at this time?   YES
<br>
<br>
As joyrex has mentioned, Einstein said "Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet". Is this true?    NO
<br>
<br>
Is becoming a vegetarian crucial for mankind's development?  NO
<br>
<br>
Is becoming a vegetarian important to mankind's development?  NO
<br>
<br>
Will eating meat obstruct mankind's evolution?  NO
<br>
<br>
Will becoming a vegetarian make a person become healthier?  NO
<br>
<br>
Will becoming a vegetarian help psychic development in an individual?  NO
<br>
<br>
<font color='"green"'>
 These answers are contradictory to what I had believed to be the truth. So naturally I was not satisfied to leave it at that. I continue with further questioning.
</font>
<br>
<br>
Is the Human body designed to eat meat?  YES
<br>
<br>
Has this always been the case?  NO
<br>
<br>
Has man always eaten meat?  NO
<br>
<br>
Is it true that mankind is not supposed to eat meat?  NO
<br>
<br>
Did mankind evolve to become meat-eaters?  YES
<br>
<br>
Did man take it upon himself to start eating meat?  NO
<br>
<br>
Did it become necessary for mankind to start eating meat?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was it necessary for mankind to become meat-eaters?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was meat always available for mankind to eat?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was there a shortage of other foods?  YES
<br>
<br>
Did mankind use up the other food resources?  NO
<br>
<br>
Did food just stop growing?  NO
<br>
<br>
Did Man become unable to grow food in the soil?  YES
<br>
<br>
Did food growing fail because of bad soil?  NO
<br>
<br>
Was there a drought?  NO
<br>
<br>
Were the crops drowned?  YES
<br>
<br>
Were they drowned in heavy rainfall?  NO
<br>
<br>
Were they drowned by rivers overflowing?  NO
<br>
<br>
Were they drowned in a flood?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this flood recorded in history?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was this the great flood in the time of Noah?  YES
<br>
<br>
So, before the flood mankind lived as vegetarians. Is this correct?  YES
<br>
<br>
After the flood, because of necessity mankind began to eat meat. Is this correct? YES
<br>
<br>
When the land became dry again should mankind have stopped eating meat?  NO
<br>
<br>
Would it have been of benefit to mankind to return to vegetarianism?  NO
<br>
<br>
When the land became dry once more did the food begin to grow in the soil again of it's own accord?  NO
<br>
<br>
Did mankind work the soil to bring back the crops? YES
<br>
<br>
Prior to the flood did mankind know how to grow and cultivate crops?  NO
<br>
<br>
After the flood was mankind taught how to grow and cultivate crops?  YES
<br>
<br>
Did this teaching come from the higher realms?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was this teaching attributed to the 'Gods' of that time? YES
<br>
<br>
Was it these same 'Gods' who taught mankind to eat meat?  YES
<br>
<br>
Was mankind taught to farm and eat meat for the benefit of mankind?  YES
<br>
<br>
Zecharia Sitchin in his translations of ancient texts tells how the Gods created certain crops of wheat and rye that could be grown and harvested to produce good yields, but that the Gods also taught hill farming and shepherding of animals to give a source of food where agriculture was not possible.  Is this what happened   YES
<br>
<br>
<br>
Was it in mankind's best interest to continue to farm meat along with the cultivation of the crops?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this how civilisation began to develop to the way it is today?  YES
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"green"'>
 ....which brings us back to the present day.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
By now the human body has become accustomed to meat. Is this correct?  YES
<br>
<br>
Would it be harmful to revert back to vegetarianism?  NO
<br>
<br>
Would it be harmful to revert back to vegetarianism completely and immediately?  YES
<br>
<br>
Would it take time for the body to change to suit a vegetarian diet?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is it necessary to begin the change back towards a vegetarian lifestyle?  NO
<br>
<br>
Would it be beneficial to mankind's development spiritually or otherwise to do so?  NO
<br>
<br>
Is there a direct connection between psychic development and vegetarianism?  NO
<br>
<br>
Is it true that many psychics believe that there is a connection between psychic development and being a vegetarian?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this related to the fact that in Eastern cultures where greater emphasis is placed on spiritual growth, they eat less meat?  YES
<br>
<br>
Do these cultures eat less meat because it hinders spiritual growth?  NO
<br>
<br>
Do these cultures eat less meat because the conditions in these countries are more favourable to towards fish and crops that are grown?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this the only reason?  NO
<br>
<br>
Do some people in these countries believe that meat hinders spiritual growth?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this a misconception that has grown over time?  YES
<br>
<br>
Is this due to the fact that because of conditions for growth and farming they have always eaten less meat than in Western cultures, who place less emphasis on spiritual growth?  YES
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"green"'>
 I know you did not specifically ask but since we are on the subject of vegetarianism I decided to go that little bit further and ask about genetically modified foods.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Are Genetically Modified crops good for human consumption?  NO
<br>
<br>
So, are they harmful to humans?  YES
<br>
<br>
Do they cause illness   NO
<br>
<br>
Will eating them make us ill?  NO
<br>
<br>
But you say they are harmful to humans?   YES
<br>
<br>
Are they harmful to humans biologically? YES
<br>
<br>
Do they harm human genes? YES
<br>
<br>
Are they harmful to humans in any other way?  NO
<br>
<br>
Are they harmful in any other way?  YES
<br>
<br>
Do they harm the planet?  YES
<br>
<br>
Do they have an adverse effect on the ecology?  YES
<br>
<br>
And this would cause many problems. Correct?  YES
<br>
<br>
Would this seriously affect life on the planet?  YES
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"green"'>
 Here is where I ended the session.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope you find these Q&amp;A helpful to you joyrex. It has taken me several hours of questioning with the pendulum to arrive at the questions and answers that I have posted here. Due to a shortage of time I leave the other question (communicating with 'higher beings') for you to ask the pendulum about.
<br>
<br>

<section>
I appreciate your answer a lot Parmenion. The answers of Karek seem quite logical, although the ethical aspects (i.e. suffering of animals) were not discussed. Also from personal experience I can tell that leaving meat out of the diet considerably makes me healthier, or so it seems. Surely there might be more aspects to this cause-and-effect that I have not yet found out. Maybe I will get my own pendulum..

<section>
Regarding the meat eating, what about the stone-age hunters? According to Karek, it is not true, and those primitive people must be vegetarians. So, is it a big contradiction to known (presumably) facts here?

Hi Parmenion,
<br>
<br>
I'd really like you to ask Karek about the animals suffering because people eat meat. I pretty much know what he is going to answer but I would like to hear it. Infact, it would be possible to ave peolpe eat meat without torturing the animals and treating them like objects. Am I right?

Dear Chill,
<br>
<br>
I will not be making any effort towards answering your questions here as you have shown me on the &lt;AND THE TRUTH SHALL BE KNOWN- You'll see!&gt; thread that you have no interest whatsoever in any reply I may make. In your latest post on that thread you make no reference to my reply, choosing instead to slate Daniel, MAYATNIK and the "Pleiadian's Dogma". I had in fact, explained how the Pleiadian teachings are completely in contrast with 'dogma' in the post you chose to ignore.
<br>
<br>
Please note that I am not offended in any way, nor do I think that anyone should read my posts just because I put them up. I will not however waste anymore of my time.
<br>
<br>
I wish also to point out that I feel it is inappropriate to pass personal remarks on people here at a spiritual forum. Not only do I feel that this is the case but it has also been pointed out on several occasions.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
<br>
Dave

CLIFF NOTES!!! YES!!!!!! Way too much to read on this and the other Mayatnik forum. I find the first Mayatnik post on the other forum tells almos the whole story. But a good synthesis as the whole deal would be nice as an ebook for the libary.

I agree on the Cliff Notes!!  I stare at computer screen all day long at school (finishing a degree in Network Engineering).  Then trying to read everything is hard on the eyes... And it doesn't help that Parmenion writes as much as MAYATNIK.  I don't mean that in a bad way, whereas he is just as thorough as MAYATNIK, it is just all very very long

hello
<br>
I haven't read ALL the thread, so maybe what ui'm asking has been asked before but...
<br>
Where does this put god?
<br>
if we were created by "aliens" is there no god in the sense that we tend to think of him?

<section>
WalkingThePath,
<br>
<br>
From what I've read, and seem to understand, it seems that there *isn't* a god as we understand it. From what I've gathered, we were created by an Alien species who's incredibly intelligent, but there are beings that are *above* them.
<br>
<br>
Also, from reading, I'm kind of under the impression that we are one of the dumbest races in the universe, lol.  That's probally not putting it the right way, but hey it happens!  Hope that helps!

<br>
<br>
What does "god" mean for you?
<br>
<br>
If god means an intelligent entity - "creator" - who created earth, life and humanity:
<br>
In what ways did he create it, in what way did he control the evolution of everything we see? If someone says we were "created" by aliens: in what way did the create us? did they invent our bodies, or did they just use the genetical material which evolved on earth up to that point in time and improved it? Are WE only our bodies, i.e. was this influence a massive regulation of our lifes from a "non-godly" source which leaves no place for "god"? Or are we so much more that this doesn't interfere at all with god's "plan"? Or maybe it was god's plan that we were modified by aliens?
<br>
<br>
If god means a unpersonal spiritual force which is ultimately identical with the whole of the universe:
<br>
Is this god intelligent nevertheless, is god more than just the sum of everything there is, does he have a will, a direction?
<br>
<br>
Do we see and know enough to answer these questions?
<br>
<br>
I can't give you answers here -- you'll have to find your own. If you believe in God, look where and what he is in your world. If you (actually or in a thought experiment) believe that aliens interfered with out evolution, look where and what they are in your world. Are these 2 in conflict, or is one of it the smaller and part of the bigger, and you only saw a small, different part of the bigger before?
<br>
<br>
It's not easy to answer questions about god. But maybe everyone can get a working model which he can feel comfortable with, neither too abstract nor too restricted.
<br>
<br>

Once, I asked Parmenion if he could go in depth a little more on Nibiru, and then he went back and edited one of his posts, which was right before mine, and I noticed he posted that the questioning took a long time (I believe the word 'hours' was used), took up a large part of his time, etc. I thought he was hinting that he'd rather not do what i requested, so I removed my post out of respect for him so maybe he could make better use of his time.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, he had already seen the post and was working on it with Mayatnik. When either Mayatnik or Parmenion realized I removed my post, Parmenion assumed I deleted my post because I simply lost interest or never had any interest in the first place, and I could tell from his next post on the 'New Plant Approaching?' thread that he wasn't too happy. I posted afterwards apologizing and explaining everything I just explained above but I don't know that he ever saw it. As I said before, he sounded a bit unpleased. He even asked Karek if she wouldve gave more info on the subject of Nibiru, had I not deleted my original post, to which karek replied 'yes' to.
<br>
<br>
I think I now understand why Karek said 'yes': If I hadn't deleted my post, Parmenion wouldn't have gotten irritated and would've had a longer Q/A session, most likely. We both made the wrong presumptions.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to Tisha's Netiquette post, I think I'll start using caps more often. I never realized it actually got on some people's nerves [

<br>
<br>
Most of the Bible's tales that have to do with God, and God communicating with people, and God taking strolls on beaches, and creating man, etc., are actually tales that originated elsewhere and came into the Bible after being edited to fit into a monotheistic religious text. For example, the Bible's story of the creation of man is just a tale based on tales from Sumeria, only the Sumerian deities (the Annunaki) were taken out completely and replaced by a single God: El, Yahweh, etc. (there is a topic is the Magic forum about the names of God). This also accounts for the grammatical 'errors', when God was actually plural, as if he had colleagues or was one of several.
<br>
<br>
So though you can't really use the evidence that we were created by beings from outside Earth to say that there is or isn't a God, you can show, whether it is accepted officially or not, that the Bible itself has more to do with ancient Sumeria and its culture than it does this God, should it exist, and that the Bible was referring to things that we are only beginning to relearn.

Dear No_Leaf_Clover,
<br>
<br>
Regarding the &lt;NEW? Plane Approaching?&gt; thread and in particular the post from myself to which you refer;
<br>
<br>
Firstly, and for the record, I edited the post in question for spelling. I was most definitely not hinting that I did not have the time to answer your question. In fact I was quite eager to find out the facts of the matter for myself. As I was and am quite busy your question was the perfect opportunity for me to do a little investigating on the subject. I can appreciate why you say you removed your post now though.
<br>
<br>
The tone you picked up on in my post on the &lt;NEW? Planet Approaching?&gt; thread was not one of irritation but of disappointment. I would have been happy to do a much more extensive post on the subject of Nibiru and the Pole Shift at that time but due to the deletion of your post it was not appropriate. I am curious as to why certain members assume that because I am in communication with Karek that I am prone to getting 'touchy and defensive'. I speak and write in clear English and have no quarrel with anyone here on a personal level.
<br>
<br>
With your consent I propose that we put this down to a mutual misunderstanding and chalk it up to experience. After all, we are both human.....well, last time I looked

edit...Even got the name wrong!

<br>
<br>
Dear Justine,
<br>
<br>
These special genes that are possessed by many people differ from the norm in a number of ways. They are coded to receive information that is being 'beamed' down to the planet on a constant basis. All human genes were originally coded to receive such information as Earth was designed to be a living library and humans the 'key-holders' to the information. Human DNA was taken apart and mankind was left with a double helix DNA structure whereas before they had twelve strands of DNA. The two strands of DNA that were left intact were sufficient to keep the body and mind functioning but removed all of the information that had been originally made available to humanity.
<br>
<br>
The rest of the DNA was not removed from the genes altogether. It was just taken apart. All of the DNA that was LIGHT-encoded ( LIGHT meaning information) was rendered unless and the information unavailable to humans. In many people now these tiny filaments of LIGHT are starting to rebuild and these people are beginning to awaken to the true reality around them.
<br>
<br>
You will find a lot of information about this and much more in the books recommended on the first page of this thread.
<br>
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Dave

the bottom part, I, once again, made an incorrect assumption. It's fine. It was my fault, anyway, for not reading all the way through your post.

YIKES!  it sure is a lot to read on both topics.
<br>
<br>
My question is:  Why don't they just land at some big event somewhere where everyone can see them,  and stop and say hello, like civilized beings?
<br>
<br>
Why all the mystery and the channelling and the abductions?  Do they really think we would not understand life on other worlds or dimensions?  I think there are many of us who would.
<br>
<br>
If they are that advanced, they can get here.  Oh sure, landing would put the world in shock and panic.  But that will happen no matter when one of these "exalted" races finally puts in an actual appearance. It is just not something you can get ready for.
<br>
<br>
So I am waiting to say "Hello, sit a spell and have a cup of coffee."   If they want credibility, they need to prove their reality.  If they created us, then they have to accept us -- as is -- warts and all.  If they want to help us, then there is no time like the present.  If they have good intentions, then perhaps it is time to show and tell.  If they do not have good intentions, then they need to leave us alone.
<br>
<br>
I also refuse to believe we are inferior beings - evolving, yes.  Inferior, no.  We have purpose and life and existence.  Our lives are valid just as they are and just as they will be from generation to generation.
<br>
<br>
So, how about it?  Next time you chit-chat with them, why not tell them to "Come on down and stay a while".  Their response might be the most interesting thing about them.
<br>
<br>
Call me a skeptic.   Call me crazy.  But I am sure I am not the only doubting person in the world.  When I see them, and can shake whatever they call a hand, I will make them feel welcome and be ready to listen for hours.
<br>
<br>
Until then, I will continue to doubt and question the source of all this channelling.[

<br>
<br>
There has to be some kind of a alien life form - but not necessarly that evolved - they could be like some kind of bugs or i don`t know ! why everyone expects them to be more clever ?
<br>
<br>
I think they could be bugs !
<br>
But i also think there are more species ! Maybe some of them are more evolved !
<br>
But there`s a maybe - so this means this is my opinion.. JUST my OPINION

  Hello Everyone,
  <br>
  <br>
  I received the following email from Ivan (*wantsumrice*) entitled "
  <u>
   BUNCH OF QUESTIONS
  </u>
  " so I have decided to post my reply here in &lt;QUESTION FOR MAYATNIK&gt; for all to share – as the points raised certainly do need to be put into the right perspective to avoid further misconceptions, such as Ivan has in general about these issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  I reproduce Ivan's email below:

     A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS
    </b>
    <br>
    Ok, because of karma is there a real reason to care about the people in lithuania who are suffering? i figured because its karma they are learning a lesson and that we shouldnt need to worry about them...because they are learning. If we interfere wouldnt we be interfering with their learning?
    <br>
    <br>
    Another...Alex and i have a strange connection...would you know anything about this? because lately we've been experiencing the same feelings and the same revelations.
    <br>
    <br>
    What is the deal with people who mock and make fun of other people? If their lives were already planned then how come they make fun of other people? OR were they supposed to make fun of those people so that THEY (ppl being made fun of) are to learn a lesson?
    <br>
    <br>
    Since our physical self basically has no say in anything in our lives, then our whole self must be in our subconcious right? If its in our subconcious then wouldnt we have two lives (one in our subconcious and our physical self?).
    <br>
    <br>
    Since we are being aware (spiritaully aware) in our lives right now that would be great jump in our spiritual developement right? Also, if we are aware, and it took so much time to be aware, do we have to do this again in our next lifetime? or is it that because we are aware now that we dont need to reincarnate later?
    <br>
    <br>
    haha, i know these are a lot of questions, but could you please answer them? theyve been plaguing my mind for a while now

  I don't know where you've got this idea from Ivan.  But, if it is from your reading of the book you bought very recently, entitled &lt;BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH&gt; (which I recommended to you), then you have clearly misinterpreted what was written there – so I would suggest you reread carefully and reflect on the material given there, because the background to everything appertaining to this point, and all the other points you raise here and much more, are all covered in great detail to be assimilated so that misperceptions will be removed.  The answers are not given on a plate – as I have said so many times – and the material needs to be really well absorbed and thought about.  Most of all, people need to build on what their intuition tells them as a starting point, to assist the removal of colouration due to conditioning fed to the people of Earth by their so-called 'leaders'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karma is there to be 'worked through' by people.  It is a societal thing, rather than an individual one.  But the lessons to be learned do affect the individual, wherever they may be – so they don't have to be in Lithuania or any other trouble spot in the world for them to benefit from the opportunities to learn.  Karma is visited upon a particular society or country, due to the initiation of a person or a group, and its effect is born by society in how they deal with it or choose to ignore it; it may then encompass the whole of several countries for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hitler was one example, where his country listened and followed what he said, or were in fear of  'consequences' to them if they didn't.  The people did not have to follow one little man.  They could have easily overpowered him, or just refused to kill people en-mass.  In their hearts they knew what was right, but their conditioning was so great that they didn't follow that inner-promting, and so followed Hitler instead – yes, they followed, even if they did nothing to stop what was happening.  But, the German people should not be judged for bestiality, but should be looked on with Compassion... because they had a lesson to learn.  And so did the rest of the world after that.  But, the world has not learned much since.  Mass killing, for the 'just cause' (yes, Hitler thought his cause was just too!) is still killing.  And, whether you are there being shot at, bombed, or starved then – in this modern age especially – you can see that people are suffering in those ways.  So, when 'just cause' leaders say kill there is a need to remember and hopefully learn that time... not the next time, but that time, when that far-off country is experiencing a Karma that will spread and engulf you too, if you do not stand up for what yu feel in your 'inner-prompting'.  Love is the key, Compassion is the way.  There is no such thing as 'enforced peace'.  Peace comes when people are happy.  So, the way to resolve Karma is to have Love and Compassion for all, whoever or wherever they may be... and to say NO to killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  I wonder why you mention Lithuania, Ivan, when there is the issue of Israel and Palestine... a Karma that has been going on for a long long time, and still people cannot see through the fog of conditioning.  The aggressive stance of countries against an unseen 'threat' they perceive, called Terrorism, is aimed in all directions by world leaders.  It does not emanate from any specific source, and has now become endemic.  Yet, what do our leaders do?  They posture aggression towards such as Libya, Iran and other countries that are supposedly 'harbouring' terrorists.  Let us be clear here – the UK and the USA has many terorists in their own country, so all that is achieved is the escalation of Fear.  Terrorism will not be stopped until the cause has been addressed; and that is injustice that started it all in the first place.  There will always be underground resistance to injustice, there always has been.  Yet the lesson has not been learned in all these centuries – to address the injustice, not squash the resistance to it.  And, at any time we each and every one of us have the opportunity, in seeing those injustices continuing, to say 'No more!' and do all we can in peace and love to help those in distress.  Not bomb their country to pieces!  And what about the injustices at home, in our own backyard?  We do not say, "Bomb us!" – No, people quietly hide those things away at the back of their minds.  Karma is visited for us to learn lessons, and not repeat history.  The solution is before our eyes to see, and in our hands to deal with in Love and Compassion, not to shelve away or cloud in self-seeking words like "If it is in our economic interest".  Each human being is a precious creation, and should be respected.  So, next time you shrug, just think – there are lessons of Karma to be learned. The point is.....When?  I have made my choice, to cry out against all injustice in the world, and plead for Love and Compassion which I extend to all, irrespective.  Will you?

  Again, I don't know where you get this confusion from.  The book makes it absolutely clear, if you absorb it all and think.  And I have myself written about these things so many times.
  <br>
  <br>
  First of all, let's put this into perspective.  We come down here to this physical 3-D world to experience.  We have a route map that is preplanned.  You can buy a route-map in a garage, but it does not mean you have to follow every turn of the roads to your destination (your 'destiny'), and there are many side-roads that you can explore along the way, and many people you can encounter – at each time there are opportunities to learn things.  It is up to you, what you choose to learn or choose to ignore.  Will you go with the 'incrowd', and mock those who are not of your group?  This is what has happened so often in religion, in its 'excusiveness', its 'club' nature, where all others have at times been seen as only fit to ridicule, or pitied because they don't have the 'right path'.   Or will you be an 'individual', even seen as eccentric because you will not conform like a sheep?  Let others ridicule – it is their lesson to learn, not yours.  Your lesson is to know your path.  And that path is not absolute, it is like any other path; it leads somewhere else.  When it is time to move on to another path, then the opportunity will be 'felt' and it is up to the individual to use their intuition to act.  So often, people stay within the 'comfort zone' they have arrived at (which, in the bigger picture, is merely a 'wayside inn' on the journey).  Whether it be a religion, Mediumship or whatever... in the long term, these are only transients of experience.  I, myself, as an online channeler, will very very soon now move on to other areas... what my guide calls the 'next stage'.  It is my choice to do this if I want to, but I am ready and so I welcome that opportunity to work with new horizons, in the way that I did when I came here to Astral Pulse.   So it will be, of my choice, that I shall soon leave the Astral Pulse after a few more posts and other tasks,  my job here then done – because here is merely a place for sharing for a time, for interaction, to teach or to learn (and we all do both in that interaction).  As my signature says: "We never stop learning – it goes on forever".  So, don't stick with the 'comfort zone', whatever it may be.  When the time comes to move on, then know this in your heart and be happy, then you can spread that happiness to others you encounter on your further journey.  We are but infants in terms of our older brothers in the galaxy, who we call the Higher Beings and who watch over us to nurture us in our evolution.  There's a big world out there, and it stretches up to the stars.  Grow tall, my friends and explore all you can – in that way you will find your way back 'home'... to your true home, your destiny.  This is a Free Will world, so it may take some time, as you wander down the myriad alleyways that beckon, but if you look within, and heed that inner-prompting, then you will see the next place on the route-map given to you for this journey.  Your subconscious knows the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The human body is simply a 'vehicle' for the journey, and the way forward is to steer that vehicle through the experiences presented in the current lifetime.  The 'person' is what others perceive, and will be what you project.  If you are in-tune with your true self (your subconscious awareness) then that is what others will see if you let it show.  So, always look within, and don't hide what you find – because that will help shine a light for others too along their way.  Emotion is the deepest quality, so express it – not in negativity (anger, frustration, hatred) but in the strongest emotion of all; love. Because, Love overcomes all Fear, and all negativity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Life (conscious awareness, according to perception) will always present obstacles, and this applies also to the Higher Realms – not just in terms of human existence.  The Higher Beings are themselves learning still – they are learning by nurturing us... by gently assisting us without interference with Free Will (a very strict rule they observe, unless there are greatly extenuating circumstances that would subvert the overall plan of Prime Creator), while we are learning to overcome conditioning by those in our history past and present who take away Free Will of the individual by media 'imagery' and 'thoughtforms' that become embedded in the consciousness of our Earthly life, collectively termed 'society'.  Shakespeare said, "All the world's a stage, and all the people in it merely players.... we each play our part".  Shakespear was a clairvoyant, a man who saw beyond the societal perceptions – and he saw the struggle of the individual, as each interacts with others in the weaving of the Tapestry of Life, according to the blueprint laid for our evolution.  A man of vision!  So, wherever you walk, along whichever path, vision is vital for you not to stumble – keep your 'inner eye' open to better see the way.  You don't have to conform and give up that Free Will.  True, there are still some places in the world where you can be put to death, or imprisoned for trying to have Free Will; even in your own locality, there are constraints that are in place to prevent Free Will – these are often termed "in the public interest"... but are they always?  Or, are they merely fences put up to keep the sheep within and effectively control them?  the choice is yours – your Free Will, to recognise and deal with each experience as it comes up.  There is an old Native American Indian saying: "Walk your talk".  So, if you see the way, don't just mumble – set off with confident stride, and let others see you know where you're going.  It is up to them, of their own Free Will, whether they see or not.  But do not be fettered by the Will of others, for each has their own journey, and should be free to walk their path.  If they choose to harm others, then their lesson is plain to see.  Love is the way.  Show others that way, and the road will be Light!

   </i>
  </font>
  <br>
  <br>
  In each incarnation there are young souls and old souls, so some have been on their journey a long time and have learned much.  For those who are old souls, their incarnation is most often in order to help others and they have a driving within them to do this that is evident.  The higher Beings, some of whom do not need to reincarnate again in 3rd Density choose very often to come back down to help guide others in this Earthly plane many times in our history, and in all countries of the world, past and present.    Due to conditioning in the world, it can take a variable time for the younger souls to awaken, and even old souls are often prevented from doing what they feel at first due to restrictions on them by society.  So the first step on awakening, is to get out of the bed of conditioning and greet the true reality they see, away from the comfort zone where they were kept slumbering, to draw back the curtains and let in the Light, unbolt the door of Fear and step outside to the fresh air of new Knowledge that is there over the threshold of habituation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this particular time in our evolution especially, thousands of old souls have chosen to be here to assist Mankind as it prepares for a giant leap forward which is coming very soon.  In addition, those of the Higher Beings that do not chose to incarnate as humans at this time are neverthless very actively involved in assisting in other ways.  The Pleiadians, for example, are here to help as 'birthers' into that higher dimensional leap for Man, centred around the time given by the Mayan end-dtate of 2012; that date is simply a 'point' in our time-frame that is at the end of the Grand Cycle, when the Phton Band is directly engulfing the Earth in its powerful rays of energy.  The Zeta, have a very active and practical role assisting Man leading up to the event known as the Pole Shift, and beyond that time leading up to 2012.  In the same way as we are many nations yet all one Family of Man, then in the larger scheme of things – including all the Higher Realms – we are all one Family of Species, in different stages of our evolution (some many many more stages further advanced than we can imagine)... but we are still all one Family in the overall Creation, of which we, as humans, are yet but infants in all of this.  So, whatever you may perceive as an individual is but a facet of the True Reality, and which is why we need to interact, and to share as we journey so that our paths may be bathed in Light.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Pleiadian Love and Light,

Hello?? Can we get real here?
<br>
<br>
How are you guys making a living?
<br>
How do you earn your money?
<br>
How do you pay your bills?
<br>
<br>
I've just lost my job due to the bankruptcy of my employer. It leaves me with 2 unpaid salaries and a loaded credit card of travelling expenses unpaid by my former employer.
<br>
<br>
So, here is my real, down-to-earth question:
<br>
<br>
1. Does your Pendulum help me to pay my bills?
<br>
2. Can it help me to solve my marriage problems?
<br>
3. Can I get filthy rich with it?
<br>
<br>
If the answer to all questions is "NO" then this forum is, with all respect, a nice novell for 5 graders....
<br>
<br>
PS: Yes, I have out of body experiences. Wonderful ones. But they don't pay my bills nor feed my kids.

Benja, this site is more about spiritual development than making money. If money is what you're looking for, you'll have to look somewhere else. A theme I've often seen here is that for the spiritually evolving, materialistic things should be seen with little to no importance.

Hi Benja,
<br>
<br>
I know when you are in "survival mode", that spirituality might seem like a novelty.  I will assume that anything I might say to the contrary will probably annoy you and be dismissed out of hand, but I still feel I need to try.  Please just give me 1-2 minutes of your time?
<br>
<br>
I ask you to please consider one thing:  Let's say (hypothetically) that you died right now.  From this perspective, think back over the last 2-3 days about all the little things you didn't pay attention to because you were too focused on what you believe to be "reality".  Maybe you got to hug somebody that you love, and now you realize it was the last time that will ever happen.  Maybe you heard your daughter laugh.  Or maybe she cried and there was something you did to comfort and show your love for her...or maybe you could have but didn't, and now that your "last chance" is gone you really WISH you had.  Maybe you could have taken an extra second to admire a sunset that you didn't notice or did not feel you had time to appreciate.  All simple things we take for granted and often fail to notice.  These particular examples might not apply to you, but I'm sure if you really reflect on this with an honest and open heart, you will see something beautiful that was...or could have been.  Seeing and appreciating these things in every moment of our lives is a fundamental aspect of "spirituality".  It is always practical in the now and exists soundly in "reality".  The critical thing is just to start deciding to see and appreciate these things in the moment to moment reality of our lives.
<br>
<br>
If you can see even the slightest glimmer of truth in anything I have written here, even if you feel hostile to what I am saying and think I'm a delusional idiot with my head in the clouds, I hope you will take a few moments to
<u>
 really
</u>
think about it.  I once felt much as you do, although my "reasons" for feeling that way were different than yours.  I read a book that totally changed the way I approach life.  Its message was simple, yet very profound.  It neither requires nor advocates any "religion".  It was spirituality that you live in moment to moment life and not something you hope to do when you you have the "luxury" of spare time.  Maybe it will help you like it helped me?  The book is called "The Power of Now", by Eckhart Tolle.  If you have a halfway decent library, you could probably even borrow it for free.
<br>
<br>
Whatever you decide, I wish you the very best.  [

wow chill!
<br>
<br>
you are so right, and i think that so many spiritual people get so caught up in reading spiritual books or trying to AP out of the body and they seem to forget the basics and that is the needs of the body and the needs to sustain life (i.e. breathing, eating, staying healthy and yes of course work to sustain all those things). when you posted that next post asking "where is the spirituality in that?.. a/ everywhere, you hit the nail on the head. Being spiritual is about living, experiencing and being happy with yourself, cause if you are not happy you wont feel fulfilled. Now taking that into account then
<u>
 Soulfire
</u>
hit the nail on the head aswell, and that was living life, fulfilling all the basic needs and also taking the time to admire all the
<b>
 beauty
</b>
around you. Once those basic needs are met and you start to see the beauty around you then you start to feel a sense of well being, happiness and contentment, this raising your energy levels and making other spiritual endeavors such as meditation, AP, and even talking to your guides much easier and way more posative.
<br>
<br>
So benja... i understand you need your basic needs met and i understand you are stressed about money and have trouble AP'ing because you are stressed, but trying to make money from a pendulum or thru channeled information isnt the way to go about it, so like i said in my original post in response to yours..... go get a job [

Soulfire, Chill, Soul - thanks a lot, i enjoyed reading!!
<br>
<br>
I studied Maslow about 15 years ago during Management Seminars - I think he still is right, because if got to pee than I won't succeed in OBE if my bladder isn't empty....so, probably Maslow was of higher spirituality (...) to find out the priorities in life...
<img alt=";-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
Eckhard Tolle's "Power of Now" is in my 700 books library, a bit dusty though, but still there. Sorry to admit that the book bored me after reading half of it. I liked most the part where he describes women's almost masochistic (my interpretation) attitude to love and stay in their pain...
<br>
<br>
Soul, I enjoyed our chat last time. My job applications by now count for about 70 negative responses. Apparently the economy's Maslow theory has just gone nuts...
<br>
<br>
So, with your permission, I'll now use my power of NOW and empty my bladder and will have an espresso before going on with job search. Oh, by the way, the pendulum said yesterday, I definitely should go ON with stock trading to get filthy rich. Just made some bucks last night after "penduling"....
<br>
<br>
Hail Myathnik for his Pendulum idea!!! (has he gone to aliens or in hospital for some treatment? - he said he soon had to leave, no?)
<br>
<br>
*lol*
<br>
see ya guys.

Hi again Benja,
<br>
<br>
You can spend your whole life waiting for something to happen to "make it possible" for you to be happy.  Or you can spend your life BEING happy and use that energy to help create the things that you desire.  Given the fact that you sound so unhappy where you are right now, maybe it is at least worth considering the possibility that your current approach is not working as well as you think it does?
<br>
<br>
Have you ever stopped and considered that there are people on this world who have less money than you, or more complicated life situations than you?  Have you ever considered that SOMEHOW, many of those people manage to have a more positive experience of life than you seem to be having, despite the fact that their life situations are "worse" than yours?  If you can accept that this is at least "possible", then maybe it is worth considering that there is a lot more to being truly happy than just the "things" you have come to think/believe are necessary to create happiness?
<br>
<br>
Many people who already have all the things you "think" will make you happy still manage to be extremely
<u>
 unhappy
</u>
.  No matter what you "have", it will never be "enough" until you learn to appreciate it.  Like anything in life, you have to practice appreciating things where you are
<b>
 now
</b>
to improve that "skill".  Having appreciation for what you have now increases your energy.  More energy makes it possible to make clearer decisions and take more effective actions in day to day life.  Taking more effective action in life can bring you the "things" you want.  If you take this approach, not only will you achieve what you desire, but when you "get there", you will be able to appreciate what you have accomplished.
<br>
<br>
Waiting around until something happens to "allow" you to be happy is a lot like an athlete waiting to become an all-star before they decide to start practicing the skills that will get them there.  Happiness is a skill, and like any other it needs to be practiced to be mastered.  The only way to practice anything is to start right now...
