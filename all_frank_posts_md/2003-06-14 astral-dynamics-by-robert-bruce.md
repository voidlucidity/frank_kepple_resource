<section>
Now I'm sure some of you are thinking, "Haven't we all read this?". However, surprisingly I've noticed that there are a number of members or guests who ask about the book in their posts.
<br>
<br>
This book is a modern classic. There must be twenty books on out-of-body and astral projection on my shelf, however
<i>
 Astral Dynamics
</i>
stands apart as a masterpiece.
<br>
<br>
Just about everything regarding astral projection is in the book. Mr. Bruce breaks the book down into a series of six parts. These include such areas as: Elements of Projection, New Energy Ways, Core Skills and Projection Exit and Techniques.
<br>
<br>
I have read the book twice so far, and will most likely read it again. It makes an invaluable reference work too, if you want to reread a particular area regarding raising energy or the rope method.
<br>
All in all, a very comprehensive guide to "getting out".
<br>
<br>
Very best,

I found the chapter on NEW energy ways very interesting and informative, and I believe it is the most valuable part of the book.

Well done Nick,
<br>
<br>
Ive noticed that so many people here haven't read AD. Roberts book is fantastic. In fact it was his Treatise on OBE that first got me so enthused about it being possible to project, and his ROPE technique that got me out the first (of just three so far) time. I'm even going so far as to put a deposit down this week for his four day residential workshop in Wales.
<br>
<br>
Astral Dynamics is a must have in any serious astral library.

<section>
Greetings,
<br>
<br>
AD is much more than the treatise on OBE. However, in the library there is also a treatise on N.E.W. and a 90 day OBE course. Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you buy the book, there is alot of material in there which is not available for download, and it is all put together brilliantly in a structured step by step format.
<br>
<br>
One subject AD does not cover directly is Astral projection/phasing, it is rather all about achieving OBE to the etheric plane, the "real-time zone", and how to get to the Astral planes from there.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I must agree. This is a great book. I am currently reading it. I was not sure about it at first, but having read some of it I would suggest it to anyone. I find it is not only very informative and helpful but a pleasure to read. It is not technical but written so anyone can understand the concepts. It is just a great read.

<section>
It looks like that the refered book it´s
<i>
 really good
</i>
. Well, it may be as you say but i have a
<i>
 little problem
</i>
with the book: i cannot read it! [
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
]. And why? Because i live in Portugal, a very closed country (in spiritual terms i mean) and a place where almost no one reads (now with the young people that´s chaniging a little). As so, it´s difficult to find "strange" books. The "Astral Dynamics" book does not exist here, and i don´t know how to get it.
<br>
<br>
Can i obtain an ebook version of the book? If not, wich is the beste website where i can read something almost good on such teachings, as Robert Bruce book?
<br>
<br>
I have the book "Astral Projection for begginers" from Richard Webster. Do you think that it´s good? Wich are the differences between that book and the Robert Bruce book (technical differences i mean: what is teached in one book that it´s not teached in the other one?)?
<br>
<br>
thanks

<section>
I have not read the book you have so I cannot tell you the differences. How hard is it for you to get books from a place on the net such as
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.amazon.com
</a>
? If you have no way of getting the book then the forums are a good source of information. Most of the information in the book can be found on the forums. Just do a search for something you want to know about. If you cannot find an answer feel free to ask. I do not think there is an ebook of Astral Dynamics, sorry.

Hi Kaz,
<br>
<br>
Go to Robert Bruce's website and download his Treatise on OBE as well as New Energy Ways (NEW). His website is at:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astralpulse.com/
</a>
<br>
<br>
Also, as fallnangel77 indicated, you can order books online such as from
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 amazon.com
</a>
as well. They have a UK site and I'm sure they can ship to where you live.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I do prefer the book over the downloads. The book is a complete text which is also something you can refer back to. Best to buy the book in my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Hi mothernatura,
<br>
<br>
You might want to try sending an email to the publisher of Robert's books. That would be Hampton Roads Publishing. Perhaps they can shed some light on the question.

<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/rb/rb.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
and you will read the following (reproduced in part):
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce is an internationally respected mystic, hands-on metaphysical researcher and arcane experimenter. He has provided an altruistic consulting service to the global Internet community since 1992.
<br>
<br>
For over 25 years, Robert has actively explored the mechanics, energetics and dynamics (how things work) of all things considered paranormal -- especially OBE; the human energy body, Kundalini, clairvoyance, healing, occult criminality and countermeasures, psychic attack and self-defense.
<br>
<br>
While disliking labels, Robert is probably best called a Metaphysicist. Somewhat of a recluse, Robert is rarely seen in public and his services have never been for hire. Robert values his privacy and prefers to use his abilities helping others, and of course as research tools.
<br>
<br>
Robert is the author of Astral Dynamics, and was a co-author of the book 'Capturing The Aura' (ostensibly to be released in March 2000, by Blue Dolphin, USA). He currently has several books and tutorials underway -- all in various states of sad disrepair... according to Robert. His World Wide Web sites carry some of his earlier written work. These are now being regularly updated with new material relating to Robert's work and interests.
<br>
<br>
Born in England in the year of the Horse, under the star sign of Cancer, Robert currently resides in The Land Down Under -- near Sydney in sunny Australia: home of the year 2000 Olympics. Everything else about Robert is subject to change without notice!
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce will glady answer serious questions relating to his work, including questions on OBE. However, Robert would much prefer it if you read his book, Astral Dynamics, beforehand.
<br>
<br>
<br>
And What Of Robert Bruce?
<br>
By Dan Carlson (Canada)
<br>
Like so many of you, I was drawn to The Astral Pulse by some inner part of me that needed something. Something that would fill the type of abstract curiosity that I am fond of. It is a type of curiosity a person really cannot describe, but rather something like a longing or some force drawing you nearer. Although I did not realize it at the time I would find the mystery and adventure that so many movies and documentaries contain. I would find that mystical, spiritual, and self-enlightening topic that consumes me.
<br>
<br>
When I finally got hooked up to the Internet, I fell upon The Astral Pulse almost immediately by pure chance. As I started to read the treatises, the tutorials, the stories, and the poetry I realized this was the sort of thing for me. These things were the things I was longing for yet until that point I did not know what I was looking for. After reading and practicing the material Robert Bruce had been writing I wanted to know him. Like so many of you I began e-mailing him with many questions and he replied with many answers. Soon enough we developed a good friendship through the e-mails. For about two years we conversed over the Internet with e-mails and when I decided to take a vacation to Australia, I knew I had to meet Robert Bruce.
<br>
<br>
In December of 1998, after traveling in Australia with friend for a month, I finally ended up in Perth and met the man behind the Treatise. Although I only had enough time and money to stay a week, I learned and listened with much enthusiasm. Robert Bruce fascinated me and I soon found out what an extraordinary person he was. He would talk of Astral experiences he had and the meaning behind them. Not only did he talk of the Astral World but also of Higher worlds and the Physical world we live in now. He has many insights to these worlds and his knowledge of them is quite extensive. Metaphysics is a way of life in his home and that really made me feel at home. It was such a pleasure to be exposed to that type of subject matter day after day for the few days I stayed in his home. Metaphysics, though, is not the only thing about Robert that is great.
<br>
<br>
Robert has a warm personality and does not have an ego of any kind. He is very humble and very easy to talk to. Him giving so much to the Internet free of charge is just a reflection of who he is. Robert is selfless, caring, genuine, and a good human being in general. His sense of humor is wonderful and I instantly clicked with him. He is also a great cook and his curry chicken is fabulous. Robert's family is just as caring and fantastic as he is. His mum, siblings and children are all great and very nice people in general. The good people also extend into Robert's friends as they are just as welcoming as he is. As I was witness to Robert's world I was instantly consumed by it. I cannot think of nicer man who is willing to give so much and expect so little. Meeting Robert, for me, was a soul composing experience.
<br>
<br>
All in all, I wanted write a little bit about Robert Bruce because he is the genuine article. And since I have actually met him, I thought I would share my experience with all of you. I could have easily written a novel about Robert Bruce but I hope that in someway I was able to convey the unquestionable good nature of Robert Bruce. I also wanted to stress that when you read what he has written you are reading words from an admirable person. I personally feel very proud to know Robert and I am very happy he has finally released his book "ASTRAL DYNAMICS". He has worked very hard on this book and you will realize that all the hard work has paid off when you read it. Again this is proof that he has selflessly given a lot of his time to help teach others what he knows.

Hi!
<br>
As far as I've seen the book isn't translated in dutch...
<br>
I have just received it in the mail this weekend through
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///bol.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 bol.com
</a>
, it's the english version, because they don't have it in dutch. I don't mind, I read english just as easy as dutch. I haven't had the time yet to really start reading the book, but from what I've seen it is quite easy to read so it shouldn't be a problem.
<br>
I'd say check out
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///bol.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 bol.com
</a>
for the book, it's quite cheap and you'll receive it within a week.[8D]
<br>
I can't wait to start reading it!

Hi everybody,
<br>
I just would like to echo the praises of this book,I have read plenty on astral projection, inc all the works of the late Robert monroe,Ive even tried the Hemi-Sync, or Binaural brainwave generator sound files,Ive done a course on the "Mysticweb", but nothing comes close to this piece of work.
<br>
Robert Bruce seems to me to have not just covered all the potential problems and how to overcome them in this book, but he for me, thrown in a large part of himself also.
<br>
He comes over as though he is talking directly to the reader, and goes at length to make his points totaly clear, leaving the reader in no doubt as to what is required, to get results.
<br>
Whats more important to me is,he isn't talking in "Iam the greatest listen to me" kind of speak, over elaborating or using need-less vocabulary. Its just a good, honest, easy to understand, errrrm? Masterpiece yes and a must for any APer.
<br>
