<section>
I have looked around the net for stuff on AP and what it is, who goes there, what to expect etc. So I have some questions that you will be able to give some half decent answers.
<br>
<br>
1. When in in the astral plane are there harmfull entites? Or are they just out to scare you?
<br>
<br>
2. Is there just the astral realm? Coz I have heard there are :-
<br>
<br>
The Astral Dimension: This is a world beautiful, serene places full of spiritual harmony. But also have evil entitys that harm you/follow you back to the real world?
<br>
<br>
Custom Realm: Where you make your own "world"
<br>
<br>
The Mental Dimension: This is where you will be able to see Wars and disasters etc, because of great amount energys.
<br>
<br>
The Buddhic Dimension: This is a warm, abstract world filled with utter peace and infinite love. It is a dimension of pure White. There is no sight or sound perception here other than the all pervading, brilliant White.
<br>
<br>
The Atmic Dimension: This dimension appears be the spirit world. Here, spirits wait for those they loved during their time on earth. This is the happy place of the gathering. It is the place where the reunion of souls takes place.
<br>
<br>
3. How easy is it to get back into your body? I read that if you wake be for you are back in your body it's then quite painfull.
<br>
<br>
4. Any other information a newbie APer should be aware of?
<br>
<br>
Thx

Well I have not encountered any harmful or scary entities in my travels yet. From what I have gathered there are some kind of entities, either real or thought form, that will try to scare you and most likely will succeed at times. As far as there being any harmful entities I have not heard any actual cases of anyone encountering anything harmful. The only harm is what you allow you to do to yourself. It can be harmful if you allow yourself to become overcome with fear and do not realize that it is just your fear that is the cause. You cannot really be hurt while projecting.
<br>
<br>
I believe there is more than the astral realm, but I have not had enough projections to actually say this for sure or what they are. I very much believe there is a Buddhic realm and I believe I have accessed this plane, though not actually projected there. There seems to be a basic belief of planes, though names and numbers may differ. They are Physical, Astral, Mental, Buddhic, and I never can remember the names of the next few but they deal with highly evolved spirits. The physical is ovibous, this is where we are now. The astral is the next plane which seems to deal alot with emotions. Mental being of mental energies. Buddhic is a place of peace, love, spiritual energy and rejuvination.
<br>
<br>
Getting back into your physical body usually just involves you thinking and "feeling" for it. If for some reason you cannot get back this way do not worry, just go with the experience and you will get back soon enough. Your astral body knows the way back and will go back when it needs to.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I understand your concerns. Actually, I could find a lot information on this Website. Check this article by Robert Bruce about astral entities.

<br>
On the Physical, many people are trapped in belief systems; ranging from total envelopment to simple colour prejudice. Problem is, you lug all this with you to the Astral. Such that, if you project expecting to have to deal with demonic entites: demonic entities you will have to deal with. If you let this continue often enough, you will most surely begin to feel "possessed".
<br>
<br>
The other extreme is: if you project to the Astral expecting to see your picture of almighty God surrounded by a zillion Angels: that is precisely what you will get by the plane load. To the extent where, if you let it continue, you will most certainly begin to feel like you were one of "God's Messengers" or such like.
<br>
<br>
Another big problem is, not only do you lug all your emotional baggage with you
<i>
 to
</i>
the Astral...
<u>
 you lug all the emotional-baggage developed on the Astral, back with you to the Physical
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
Also, on the Astral, you can come across "fragmented energy". These can take many forms. Some of these fragments (that I call Scamps) take great delight in trying to scare you. If successful, they feed off your emotional energy and use it as "fuel" in order to make themselves appear something much bigger, and much scarier, than they really are.
<br>
<br>
When you come across these critters, for the first few times, they easily catch you out. But after a while you get so used to them they no-longer bother you. This is because they scan your thoughts and realise they aren't going to surprise you and get the desired effect. So they just leave you alone (but you can still, occassionally, get caught out). Same too with other "energies" which often take great delight in bursting through people's "protection". Again, what you have to realise is these entities can scan your thoughts. Thus they know, with absolute accuracy, where your mental weaknesses lie.
<br>
<br>
I've flipped through posts here and there, on various BBS's, that follow along the lines of, "I visualised "XXX protection system" before I projected but still the demons came... help!"
<br>
<br>
What these people are failing to realise is that it is not the "protection system" in itself that keeps the demons away. It is your
<i>
 belief
</i>
about it that determines whether it works for you or not. However, I would recommend people take one step further than that and realise the true picture of how beliefs, thoughts and emotions (biggest one being fear) colour your Astral experiences.
<br>
<br>
Once you get more proficient at projecting, you often come across people with bits missing. Half-corpses of men, women and children, writhing in agony after having been mutilated by bombs, missiles, swords, natural disasters, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
It takes a while to get used to such images. But you must resist the temptation to react emotionally as you, yourself, will become Astrally-enveloped by them. Logic and reason play a big role here. What you are seeing is the aftermath of various destructive actions on the Physical. You just hope that eventually a "facilitator" will come along that will have the power to transport these people to levels where they can become whole again.
<br>
<br>
It's the mutilated children that still effect me, though, even after years of Astral experiences. It's happening less and less now, but when first seeing such  things I'd wake-up, in the Physical, with a feeling of wanting to cry my heart out. But the trick is to simply let the emotional energy dissipate, drift off to sleep, and start a fresh next time.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Thanks for the input. I'm still yet the read some other stuff that Vallk pointed me to which I shall read after this.
<br>
<br>
I've just read  VICTOR ZAMMIT thing and there's a couple of parts that caught my attention which is..
<br>
<br>
"Those with dogmatic, unalterable fixed ideas about what to expect immediately after death are likely to experience serious problems."
<br>
<br>
Then another bit that I read was..
<br>
<br>
"The more knowledge we have about the afterlife, the easier the transition."
<br>
<br>
So the more we know about the after life the easier the tansition is. Ok, so, we will know more or less what to expect when we depart the more we read etc, which is a bad this as it will cause problems for us right?

I just finished reading that as well. Here is what he is trying to say about that. Those that keep a strict idea of the afterlife will cause problems for themself because when they get there and things are not as they should be, well it will just mess them up. These people were so rigid that they would not entertain the idea that it could be any different, then they are suddenly in this place that is not what it should be to them. I also see another angle on this. It could also be that they do go to "heaven" when they die. Only this is not a true heaven but something that is of thoughts. This can lead them astray as they will not see the truth.
<br>
Read as much as we can about what the afterlife will help us when we have to face physical death. But as you point out, this can be dangerous as well if it is taken too strictly and do not keep an open mind. The more we read the more we will have an idea of what it can be like to help us adjust better. But I do not think that any words can describe the afterlife so an open mind is helpful.

Is there a site that explains the known realms? Or are they just other names for the Focus levels, right?

Judgmental much?
<br>
Geeze... he's not even talking about a specific retrieval.  He's talking about what a person might expect, which probably isn't a good thing to do in my opinion anyway.  But that's besides the point.
<br>
<br>
Frank had his opinions and beliefs... you have your opinions and beliefs.
<br>
Your opinions have no bearing whatsoever on his... and, if he was still around, likewise.
<br>
<br>
Just accept his experiences for what they are... *HIS* experiences.  You don't need to analyze them.  You don't need to compare them.
<br>
<br>
My suggestion to you Pauli is one that you've heard many times before.  Work on having your own experiences before you start to judge others.

<br>
Key sentence, here. If Frank believed he had such 'power' the context of this post leads me to believe he'd use it. But maybe an expert in altered states doesn't equate to an expert in retrievals? Maybe it's not a role just anybody has the ability to play.. who knows? If he did in fact engage in retrievals then the point of dragging this dusty thread out of the attic is moot.
<br>
<br>
I also think a lot of good advice is contained in that post, especially regarding how to face those really unpleasant experiences.
