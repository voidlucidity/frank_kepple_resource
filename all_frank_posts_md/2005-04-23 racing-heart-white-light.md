Hi:
<br>
<br>
It sounds like one of the energy-rush sensations people typically get when they follow the more traditional "techniques". Sounds like you ignited the energy centre in the region of your chest. What usually happens is you get a huge rush of energy and you feel like you are flying off here, there and everywhere. Before you know it, you'll then snap back to the physical and wonder what the heck happened. :)
<br>
<br>
I'm not really into the energy-work side of things but I do fire off the odd energy-centre now and again as the energy-rushes are a big laugh, quite exhilarating in fact. Especially the chest one! I set this off about once a week to experience the great sensations it gives.
<br>
<br>
If I want to project in the traditional sense then, with me, I switch on the energy centre at the top of the head. Just ignite it enough so it buzzes and crackles. Sort of like a static electricity sensation which travels up and down my body from my head to my solar plexus region and back again. I suppose if you are not used to it then you might find it unpleasant.
<br>
<br>
If I switch it in too much then I get pretty harsh vibrations and I end up just zooming off uncontrollably. Which is what I used to do for years until I realised it could be controlled. Now I can steadily increase the energy of it and bring it to the point where I can roll-out into the RTZ. When I'm doing any basic Monroe work such as the kind if thing he wrote about in JOURNEYS then I will project this way.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Yes, I've had sensations just like that before projection my first few times, don't worry about them, the best thing to do is maintain focus and you'll project, good luck!

<section>
so what is the most effective way of opening these energy centres and how do you keep them charged?

It could be also a symptom of trance and hyperventilation...
