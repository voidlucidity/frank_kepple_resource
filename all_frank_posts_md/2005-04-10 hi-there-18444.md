Hi. I am so glad i found this forum. It looks like from the posts here that this is a good place to help people and be helped on the spiritual path. I have been interested in things new age, pagan, and spiritual in general for a long time. New age/astrology for the longest, pagan stuff only a little. I come from a materialistic viewpoint/ and background, not believing in God, or angels, or spirits, ufo's,etc. Untill I became a runaway when I was 16, I then began to question life, the universe, and everything.
<br>
I just saw the movie/documentary 'what the bleep do we know!?', and I thought it was great. I havent been really strong into the new age/spiritual stuff for awhile, but I am back on track now. And the questions keep comming, dont they?

Hi Milamber
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Forums - I'm glad you found us!
<br>
<br>
Enjoy your stay. Â The trouble with questions (I'm finding) is that the answers you get just create more questions!!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's all good.
