This work seeks to describe in scientific terms the nature of the holistic Universe, which, in fact, is the same Universe that the ancient Masters have taught mankind over the millenia. The similarities really are profound. Below is an extract:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "The Soul is immanent in each of the multiple selves as it is in ours (HP9). Thus each self refers to it as "my soul", although the soul includes more selves than one (MHP8). Our soul is within our self, and our self is in our mind and body. This means of course that our Soul is immanent in our mind and body. The soul in turn is a part of an even higher order entity unknown to us. It in turn is part or subpart of the humankind-entity. This proceeds through entities of higher and higher order, through earth-entity all the way up to All-Entity.
 <br>
 <br>
 All are immanent in "us", in our bodies, minds, our Selves, and our Souls. If we could proceed in our consciousness to peel off the outer layers of us, one by one, starting with our body, we would recognize higher and higher entities as our "real I", eventually experiencing All-Entity as our ultimate true identity. In this sense, and with the appropriate state of mind, it is no blasphemy to state that "I am God". This is exactly the path to enlightenment taught by Yoga, Buddhism, and other mystic philosophies. They all seek the awakening to one's innermost reality, which turns out to be the holistic reality of the whole universe. The ancient scriptures of Hinduism, for instance, the Vedas, call the innermost personal reality "Atman",
 <br>
 and the ultimate reality of the universe "Brahman". The wisdom to be understood and to be experienced is that Atman and Brahman are one and the same (90)(91)(92)(93)."
 <br>
 <br>
 "All-Entity
 <br>
 <br>
 We can now make some definite statements about the nature of M-D reality, beginning with All-Entity. All-Entity is the source-entity of everything; all other entities in the universe are Its sub-entities (HP3,MHP1). The entire universe is a holon with All-Entity being the whole. All-Entity and Its parts are one and the same, seen from different points of view (HP6).
 <br>
 <br>
 All-Entity has an infinite number of degrees of freedom (HP1). It includes in Itself all aspects, capabilities, and potentials of everything that exists (HP3). For instance It has all human aspects, but beyond these an infinite number of others. All-Entity has no individuality, if we mean by individuality to be different from others. There are no others on that level to be different from. Being the source-entity of everything alive, All-Entity is the very essence of life. It transcends and resolves all differences between entities in the universe (HP5). Thus All-Entity is ultimate harmony. Love is harmony between living beings, therefore All-Entity is ultimate Love."

  Although this article is not new to me, I must say that it is a wonderful one to get one started in the wonderful world of metaphysics [

Agreed. I also like the way the author draws parallels with the more traditional, mystical lines of thinking yet still displays good science. Oh, just yesterday I discovered the author has written a book along similar lines. Has anyone read it?
<br>

Clandestino,
<br>
<br>
You can order from
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Amazon.com
</a>
(U.S. based) and get just as reliable service. You can expect to wait just 11-18 days for delivery once shipped (usually within 24hrs) I use this U.S. site very often, as I have to rely upon overseas companies to aquire most of the books I have an interest in. I find it cheaper than the U.K one when you transfer the currencies, even though the shipping is more expensive.
<br>
<br>
Take care
<br>

P.S; if anyone knows of a good bookstore that stocks metaphysical books, please do let me know.

I'm going to read it. My first impression is that it is similar to the material described in the Seth books about the nature of reality.

that's kick-butt. Â starting about a year ago, when someone would ask me what i believe god is, i would tell them that i am god, meant in that exact sense.

Just finished reading the essay. Im not a scientifically minded person, but I have to say that the author has taken this most important topic and disected it in a manner all can relate to. A wonderfull perspective I had not expected to find on this matter.
<br>
<br>
If you have yet to read this essay, I whole-heartedly reccommend you do so.
<br>
<br>
Take care
