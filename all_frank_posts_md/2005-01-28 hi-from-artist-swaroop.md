Hi Swaroop,
<br>
<br>
How are things in Bangalore? I spent a month in India back in December of '91. Part of the time was in the garden city of Bangalore and I have fond memories of time spent there!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
By the way, your artwork is fantastic! You are certainly talented!
<br>
<br>
I hope you like the forums here. There are quite a lot of diverse topics, and plenty of opportunity to get involved. We'll look forward to your participation!
<br>
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick

Hi Selski! u seem to remember my name??? Deja Vu??? Anyways, I was a member of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///astralforum.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Astralforum.com
</a>
and otehr astral sites, u may have seen my name there.
<br>
<br>
And, Nay too! u seen my art before??? You do time travelling? How could you have seen it! as most of my art work are new ones
<br>
<br>
And, dear! this is a really huge site and a newcomer I am , I am in a dizzy spell as to discover this site!
<br>
<br>
Nick u had been in Bangalore in 1991!!! Wow, Bangalore was a much green and cool place then
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
NOw its industrialised
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
<br>
p.s. does this website require proper spellings? Like is it okay to spell 'the' as 'teh' and 'you' as 'u' ?

astralforum.com - that's where I know you from!
<br>
<br>
... with regard to spelling, there is no-one quite as strict as Happy Nightmare here
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
, however, some people are put off reading messages with dozens of errors, especially when there is a spell check you can use to help.  It's a little box just underneath the message you are typing.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
<br>

<br>
I've no idea about astralforum - since coming here, I feel I've found "home" and haven't bothered with any other astral sites!
<br>
<br>
I know it was always on the verge of closing down, due to financial difficulties - maybe they finally ran out of money?

Welcome to the forum!
<br>
<br>
Say hello to India for me. Great place, great people, and I hope you like it here. I always wanted to meet the One all-time love of my life and take her to the Lake Palace hotel in Udaipur, and just sit by the lake and look into her eyes until the sun came up. It's said to be one of the most romantic places on earth.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

Ha!  Perhaps I do time travel..   Seriously though, the name Devianart really does sound familar.....is that a word used for this type of art?  I think your work reminds me of some stuff I saw on Webshots.    Atop The Dry Hill, is very cool.

<section>
thanks RT , but I have been astral projecting, but I dont know whether to call them 'astral projections' or just a 'brain generated lucid dream'
<br>
<br>
I hope in a few days of surfing on this nice site, I will know the answer
