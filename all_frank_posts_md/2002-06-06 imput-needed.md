Good day folks.
<br>
<br>
Two nights ago, i had a strange experience. I had gone to bed in hopes of falling asleep. That i did, or so i thought. I guess i was dreaming but i became lucid. I remember being happy of the thought that i was aware and lucid. But than as soon as that happened I began to shake(vibrate) internaly. and it was getting more and more intense...i got a little scared and choose to wake myself up...know...i would just like to know if those kind of vibrations are normal for a OOBE or should the vibrations be different...thx in advance
<br>

sounds like obe stuff, you should read astral dynamics. a few years ago i had nights where i would have 5 of those vibration episodes but never projected until i tried techniques.

Thx Ralphm.... i have read lots of books, I am aware of many thechnique. I guess, because it was the first time, i was a little overwhelmed with it, excited, scared, etc...anyways...i hope i'm going in the right direction, but the strange thing is,   I did not conciously try to get out of body...the only thing i've been doing lately is visualize that i'm surrounded by very bright light. I dont realy know if that is what triggered my experience or not. But as usual i am constantly trying to focus my mind towards a new understanding and knowlage...
<br>
<br>
if anyone would like to comment or help me out...Please feel free to do so!                                                                                                   Paul =)

What you experienced was very normal. Though it takes a while to get your sense of conscious awareness used to the idea.

Hi -
<br>
<br>
I want to also say that what you describe is normal.
<br>
<br>
Your goal doesn't necessarily need to be projection. (Of course, that's probably why we're all here on this forum!) Being surrounded by white light sounds like a wonderful way to do lots of things 'in house' like healing, dream programming, greater sense of oneness with the universe, and so on.

p.s. but becoming comfortable with the vibratory state is probably a good idea regardless of your intention. I think a lot of people find that they become comfortable with it over time and also that the intensity of the experience diminnishes to more of a warmth flowing through the body.
