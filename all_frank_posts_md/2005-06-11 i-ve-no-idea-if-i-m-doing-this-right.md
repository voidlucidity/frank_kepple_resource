every time i try to project, it feels like I'm being tossed about on a raft in a storm but not as intense.  like, my body is floating and rocking all over.  last night i felt like i floated out of my body and turned over, but nothing happened after that.  after that it felt like i was laying on top of my body in the same position.  i need some advice.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You are on the verge of projecting into the area I call the wider physical. You are about half way between being "in" your body and projecting within the area commonly called the real-time-zone. You are sort of being buffeted around a bit half and half.
<br>
<br>
What do you do to actually get to this state?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

i focus on energizing my chakras.  i have ADD, or something like that, so its very hard to focus on anything for long periods of time, but i find that focusing on energizing chakras is something i can easily focus on for about an hour or two.  so, I'm focusing on the chakras, and my body starts tingling.  I'm thinking "cool.  that was fast.(normally it takes an hour for anything to happen. this took about 5 min.) OK. focus time" the vibrations get a lot stronger. my eyes roll up into my head(first focus smasher.  i actually like the vibrations.  they feel cool) then i focus on pulling myself up a rope, which usually causes my astral body, if you will, to feel like its being tossed about, then i feel like I'm floating up, but i kind of lose focus while climbing the imaginary rope with my imaginary hands. also, when i start to project, my heart starts going really fast, and it feels like my body is getting pushed up and down(head to toe up and down.  not front to back)  does that help any?
