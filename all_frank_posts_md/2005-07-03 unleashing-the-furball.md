Hi.
<br>
Yes, I'm new here even though I used to browse through this forum over a year ago, but......
<br>
<br>
There is SO much here I want to read I'm going cross-eyed.
<br>
This place is definitely up this cat's alley.
<br>
<br>
Grateful to all who make this place possible, and to all the contributors in the field who have opened our eyes.
<br>
<br>
Began having OBE's intentionally when I was 22 (now I'm 33) after getting into Sylvan Muldoon's books, then Robert Monroe's and Robert Bruce's.
<br>
<br>
Some weeks I can have up to 3-4 nights (or rather, early mornings) of being 'out and about' and then I get dry spells as we all do.

Definitely found that sexual energy is a good instigator so celibacy is the key to be free for me.

Hi all, and lots of best wishes from the winged_kitty from Down Under.
