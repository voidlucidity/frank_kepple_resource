<br>
<br>
A few of you have asked what is involved, how to get into it, etc.
<br>
<br>
With me, I've long since been fascinated by the concept of being stuck in emotional loops, and so forth, and have a regular guide who used to take me on tours of the lower regions and show me some of the more interesting cases. Many of the examples I saw were a bit sad, but I generally found it easy to remain closed and simply be an observer. After all, it was basically their own fault they were in that state, not mine.
<br>
<br>
Big problem came, though, when I saw the kids. They were innocent, yet were caught in some of the most ghastly circumstances imaginable. So I went through a phase of wondering if there was some kind of way these little ones could be helped.
<br>
<br>
One morning a guide came and took me to a park in Focus 27 that was full of children who had been rescued (I posted about this experience a while ago so I won't go into it here). And around the same time, someone calling themselves Waterfall posted info on this BBS that got my curiosity up.
<br>
<br>
I did a bit of digging and discovered lots more about it.
<br>
<br>
One of the main proponents in this field is a chap called Bruce Moen, coupled with the Monroe Institute who run a Lifeline program which (so they say) teaches you about how to do retrieval work. Bruce Moen did the TMI program and then discovered he was Bob Monroe's long lost soul mate. He also wrote a few books on the subject.
<br>
<br>
I posted a link to the BM message board a short while ago on another thread. In case you missed it, it's:

<br>
<br>
Well, much of what they do is way, way too touchy-feely for my tastes. Especially this binding concept they have called: Pure Unconditional Love. They send it to each other, and to those they are preparing to rescue. They also like to hold hands and chant around this big crystal in Focus 27, and so on. All of which is not me at all: I merely present the information as some may find it useful.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I decided to go ahead and try and rescue some of these innocent children. I made this clear to Harath, and he first starts chuckling; then here's me trying to be all serious, and he's laughing his head off.
<br>
<br>
I was more than a bit miffed when he told me that's what he'd been priming me for all along. To cut a long story short, it appears there are Astral entities who are always on the look-out for people, in the Physical, with the right kind of qualities to train them up to do particular kinds of rescue work.
<br>
<br>
Basically, they need people who can cope with all the real nasty stuff which, more often than not, involves children.
<br>
<br>
However, the only qualities you really need is to have a high degree of control over your projection experience. As not everyone who is trapped, is entoumbed in some frightful circumstance. Quite the opposite, some of them.
<br>
<br>
All you need to start, is to project to the Astral and ask for a guide to show you how it's done.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Opposite in what way... that their emotional loop is a happy one?  Or that they're not trapped at all, but rather waiting to ambush someone?
<br>
And how does it help to have good "control over your projection experience"?
<br>
<br>
(PS - this is the most amazing stuff I've ever read)

Well, yes, depending on circumstances you can get caught in any emotion. However, because of the nature of people generally, emotions such as fear and anger are more common.
<br>
<br>
I've come across people who appear to be doing nothing more than just sitting reading; or just sitting like they are waiting for someone to arrive; or for some thing to happen; or even just lying there sleeping. Problem is, they don't realise they've been sitting or lying there for perhaps 20 or 30 years!
<br>
<br>
As for control over your own experience, well, to do this kind of thing you need a fair degree of skill in projection. Basically, you need all your faculties together and you have to realise the need to remain emotionally closed. Otherwise you end up flitting here, there and everywhere, which is not much use.

You know what makes me wonder when you have a obe or low level obe/partial obe when you see kids looking at you at your bedside I wonder why they are there?  Also when a tragedy happens such as a bus accident killing so many kids or say a drowning child in swimming pool, sometimes you see a physical sign ie a light from a unknown source shining on the spot of the incident.  Are the children well or are they really stuck somewhere because they have not matured mentally to believe in God or know what happens to them when they die and have that faith so they can go to the right place?

I'm not sure what you meant in your post by, "low-level obe" and about having people looking at you from your bedside. So I can't offer any input there. But I can say, in answer to your question above, in my experience the problem with many children is they have been abused by circumstances to the extent where they never really had a "childhood" in the typical 21st-century, 1st World sense. Which is what causes a large part of the problem.

Cannot see what difference your age would make. In the rescue of youngsters, I could see you would have a significant advantage. One of the problems I repeatedly face is directly caused by the fact that virtually all the cases I come across are to do with children who have been abused by adults in some way or another. So it is forever a challenge to find a way to gain the child's trust.
<br>
<br>
All you basically need is to have a good degree of control over your projection experience. Otherwise you tend to flit about here and there, which scuppers the process. Or, what can also happen is you become emotionally involved in the circumstances of the person you are attempting to rescue. Which again scuppers the process.
<br>
<br>
Also, bear in mind that all "rescue work" is automatically done under the guidance of other people who are residents of the higher realms beyond the Astral. So you can always rely on them for support.
<br>
