Hello,
<br>
<br>
I'm just kind of wondering how can you tell if a person in the non-physical is real or if it's simply your imagination making it up? or is it one of those things were you just know it from instinct?
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This is one of the big benefits of realising there are primary areas in consciousness. Primary Focus 2 is an area of individual consensus reality. So here you are viewing your own constructs. The only "communication" possible within this area from the "outside" so to speak, is telepathy.
<br>
<br>
You can receive impressions or feelings, and such like, that you could say are not your own. In doing so, you can convert these mental impressions into images. For example, if you receive a telepathic communication from a close friend then, as the signal comes into mind, you may create a picture of your friend, and that kind of thing. But these images are your mind-created realities.
<br>
<br>
As you step into Primary Focus 3 then this is an area of common consensus reality much like the physical is. Here you can meet people in a totally objective sense exactly as you can while physical. Within this region it is obvious these people are not merely creations of your own imagination. It is as obvious as it is apparent that other people are not merely creations of your imagination within the physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
