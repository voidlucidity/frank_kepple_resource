<section>
I wish I could be like you guys. Making the sacrifices, spending hours meditating but I always find the easiest ways.
<br>
<br>
Last night after sleeping for several hours I went and played with my computerfor about 45 minutes or so. which is the interupted sleep technique. I then went to bed and put on William Buhlmans Sleep Programming tape ( affirmation tape). If it didn't happen, so what.  Within 20 minutes I was in "the state". I then rolled over and out out of my body.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to go to my card I have waiting in the other room but when I was able to see, I was in my old house I used to live in. It wasn't a real time ob. It may have also been a self created ob. I asked for clarity now because it was kind of dreamy and fading fast. It didn't work and I was back in bed.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to try again but I was being harassed by a giggling phantom female who kept jabbing me in my bed every time I was getting close. Eventually I gave up, and turnned the tape off.

<section>
When you say , you were in "the state" .. can you clarify a few thigns for me ?
<br>
<br>
like
<br>
<br>
1) did you feel your body or did you feel as if it wasnt there anymore
<br>
<br>
2) did you see wahts called the "void" or big blackness, maybea galaxy without stars kinda thing ..
<br>
<br>
3) Did you feel like your perception was changing .. maybe like you were being pulled in and out of your body ? *I got that last night doing breath awareness for hte first time .. what does that mean ? It felt like I was being zapped back and forth*
<br>
<br>
4) And what other things did you feel ? I am the kinda person that doesnt really get vibrations .. althought I havent been conciously "out" yet .. I've only got them one time , in my classroom at school when I sorta fell asleep while listening to the teacher..
<br>
<br>
thanks , if yo ucan answer any of these for me =P

<section>
1) did you feel your body or did you feel as if it wasnt there anymore
<br>
<br>
I felt diconnected from my body. If I tried to move it, it wouldn't move unless I woke it up, which would take a little time.
<br>
<br>
2) did you see wahts called the "void" or big blackness, maybea galaxy without stars kinda thing ..
<br>
<br>
No. I just saw what you usually see with your eyes closed until I was out, or Lucid.
<br>
<br>
3) Did you feel like your perception was changing .. maybe like you were being pulled in and out of your body ? *I got that last night doing breath awareness for hte first time .. what does that mean ? It felt like I was being zapped back and forth*
<br>
<br>
When I thought I was ready, I moved the body double with my awareness in it away from my physical body. If I was unable to move I would then know to stop because I would be  trying to move my physical body, which would end the experience. It could also mean I wasn't fully disconnected.
<br>
<br>
If you feel your awareness moving around, you are on the right track.  At least as an excercise.
<br>
<br>
4) And what other things did you feel ? I am the kinda person that doesnt really get vibrations .. althought I havent been conciously "out" yet .. I've only got them one time , in my classroom at school when I sorta fell asleep while listening to the teacher..
<br>
<br>
I don't often get the vibrations these days and I never have used them to get out.  I just feel strange. Disconnected. Unable to move. Mind awake, body asleep. It can be frightening if you let it, and it takes will power to even remember to try to ob. Sometimes the last thing I want to do is try an ob when I'm in the proper state. As time goes by the fear has faded and I take full advantage unless I'm too tired.
<br>
<br>
I think I just construct the form of my body because that is the way I have been moving and experiencing since I have been in this world. I then open the eyes of my astral so called body and go. end
<br>

Good post Wierdzly.  But just to clarify to some of the newbies, not everyone here practices for hours at a time in special, set-aside times.  You can just as easily practice everytime you lie down at night to go to bed.  I only say that, because I know when I was first starting out, I thought that you HAD to devote at least 1-2 hours of time to practice projecting, or else you wouldn't make any progress.  While the more practice, the greater your chance of learning through experience, you can always practice by watching yourself fall asleep at night.  This is to give hope to all those who say, "But I don't have time to practice because I work a full time job, I have kids to take care of all day, etc."

Believe it or not, a 5 minute astral experience is a very long time!  Most projections last under a minute, but they are not a disappointment in the least bit.  Although I've had a few long projections, most of mine seem to be around 5 minutes or less.
<br>
<br>
It's probably good to keep your experiences short at first anyway.  It's far more beneficial to have 5 short experiences where you remember extreme detail and clarity, as opposed to one long experience where you forget a lot and don't get a lot of practice with exiting techniques.

heres a question guys , if yo usay that projection are usually short .. does that vary with the person or are all of them always around 5 minutes ?  What ends them if you dont want them to end?  Is that only for the real time projection or can you increase the times and still remember it in much clarity ?   I hope I can make mine last a little longer so I can check out things for a while , what ends them for you?

<section>
it would make sense to me that the amount of time you spend is directly proportional to the amount of energy you have raised. That is if you dont succumb to the astral wind, end it yourself, or a host of other things. I had a serious problem with learning to control my movement and keep getting blown right back into my physical. Actually i found it humorous and not disappointing,,,heheh. Thats one thing i can suggest too. Dont take this stuff too seriously. If you keep positive thoughts and realize that each time you get discourged, you are actually defining another obstacle for you to overcome. Eventually, after overcoming these obsticals, i think you will find it easier to jump over next time you encounter it.

Albert Taylor says he has been out for as long as 3 or so hours. Others like Jerry Gross claim their goal is to be out of body as soon as they go to sleep until they awake.

No, this varies from person to person.  For me personally, most of mine are around 5 - 10 minutes.  They've definitely gotten longer the more I've practiced and gotten experience.  Others have been known to stay out for hours.  I can only imagine what that must be like.  The thing is that when I'm projecting, I have no idea about time.  I don't even think about it.  It's only when I come back and analyze my experience that I start to tally up how long I must have been out, taking into account all that I saw and did.  So when I say I was out for 5 minutes, it's simply an approximation of how long I think I was out based on the experience.

<br>
<br>
For me, they are sometimes hard to control.  The slightest thought about the physical body can send you back to it....and believe me, when you find yourself existing without your physcial body, it can be quite challenging not to think about it!
<br>
<br>
It's also difficult to control your emotions.  Overexcitement or fear can spiral the experience out of control and send you back.  Also, LACK of control will make the experience fade and you may simply fall into a deep sleep, hardly even remembering the OBE in the morning.

With practice, you can not only increase the length of your experiences, but you can remember the tiniest detail.

Jeff -
<br>
you say that you watch yourself (the process that is) of going to sleep...
<br>
<br>
doesnt that just result in not being able to go to sleep?
<br>
I would imagine that the result would be that you would keep mentally ckecking yourself evertime you were drifting off, resulting in no sleep!
<br>
<br>
Can you clarify?
<br>
I would like to use this simple technique but it does sound like it could lead to the insomniacs nightmare...

But I'm not thinking of it in the right way.

When I say I watch myself go to sleep, I have to do it in a detached way.  It's like what happens to you when you stare at yourself in a mirror.  After a minute, your entire environment seems to fade to black, and all that seems to exist is your reflection.  You almost get caught up in it without even trying.
<br>
<br>
Watching myself go to sleep is a lot like that.....except instead of staring at a reflection, I stare into the blackness.  Every now and then, things come into focus, which I try to hold as long as possible.  The longer this goes on, the more clearer the images are and the longer I can hold them.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, it keeps you awake, but the more you practice at it, the easier it becomes to allow your body to fall asleep while your mind is not only observant, but detached from the whole process.  The problem most people have is that they can get their body asleep just fine, but their mind is still very close to it.  You have to get to a point where the mere thought of a physical body is so foreign to you that you don't even think about it.

<section>
Well, I think everyone is different.  Personally I watch the blackness like Jeff for a little while and then I detach myself from watching and just float in the blackness content and passive like an observer. If I watch for images then I stay to connected with my body and can't relax deep enough.
<br>
<br>
Then the images start fading in slowly , the change is so suddle you don't even realize that your site has kicked in until you are saying, "look, that is a tree and there are some flowers, I'm here in this field but I also know I'm meditating"  and then you realize that you made it!  You are out!  But don't get to excited, be passive.
<br>
<br>
I also agree with Jeff about spending only 1-2 hours practicing.  It really isn't that much time.
<br>
<br>
So, Best wishes and keep practicing!

While we are talking about the subject of time, I have discovered something fun to do while in  a  deep trance.  After you have  projected  or are ready to call it a day from your practicing, mentally ask "I wonder what time it is?"  I know this sounds a bit strange to ask, but give it a try.  Rely on the spiritual to give you an answer.  Sometimes the time given is correct and sometimes it isn't and sometimes you may not get an answer at all.   When it is correct, it really gives you a nice boost in the old confidence!
<br>
<br>
I  stubled over this fun little tech  by accident.

<br>
Anyone feeling dismay at only being able to project for a short time, shouldn't. Physical time does not exist on the Astral, therefore, it is next to impossible to compare one with the other.
<br>
<br>
I have had countless projections where it felt like I was out for hours but only actually amounted to a few minutes in Physical-matter time. Think of it as a kind of Timeline that is divided up into fixed segments. At the onset of projection you hop off the Timeline at a particular segment, then jump back on again when you return.

Thanks for that Jeff, I gave it a go last night and after five minutes or so lying in bed, I felt myself relax a bit as you do before going to sleep.
<br>
Sure enough, after a few more minutes, faint images of what looked like geometric shapes and also blobs of colour stated to appear in the distance of my 'black' field of vision. (my eyes shut of course) as I fixed on them they disolved however. Am I on the right track here? Perhaps practice every night will imrove on this.
<br>
<br>
Another interesting effect that I have often got before I drop off is this:
<br>
Sometimes as I am lying there with my eyes shut staring at the 'black field', waves of white (or greyish) blobs fly past me from the edges of my peripheral vison, they will increase in intensity and speed before fading out again after a minute or so.
<br>
Is this effect related in any way do you think?
<br>
<br>
Regards Douglas
<br>
<br>
PS, that thing with watching yourself in the mirror till everything fades to black apart from your image... yeah, I ve done that... I dont know what causes it but it sure is freaky!
<br>
The fact that your face changes out of all recognition is also weird, of coure I think the whole thing is brought about from keeping your eyes open for to long.... so its probably not very healthy for them!

Could be.  I know that if you see these within the first few minutes of closing your eyes, I usually attribute those as after images (as your eyes get used to the dark).  However, if I'm meditating for more than 5 minutes and I see ANYTHING (colors, objects, shapes, etc), I never take those lightly.  I always try to focus in on those.

  PS, that thing with watching yourself in the mirror till everything fades to black apart from your image... yeah, I ve done that... I dont know what causes it but it sure is freaky!

Yeah, it was a good analogy for what happens to me when I stare at the blackness in my field of vision.

  The fact that your face changes out of all recognition is also weird, of coure I think the whole thing is brought about from keeping your eyes open for to long.... so its probably not very healthy for them!

Yeah, you can get some pretty freaky distortions when you do that.

Last night I went to sleep at around 7pm because I was exausted. I later woke up around midnight. Feeling refreshed I decided to try the sleep interruption - affirmation technique again. After flushing 2 hours or so on my computer I then went to sleep with the tape playing.
<br>
<br>
Within an hour I was in the state. I then walked away from my body as my vision came on.  I remember asking for and getting "clarity now", several times.  I didn't really know where I was and could not fly or go through walls. It seemed like I was out for a very long time (20 minutes) trying to get back inside my present time house.
<br>
<br>
I guess I may have stayed out for too long as I barely remembered any detail.  All I remember is thinking while I was out that I am 2 for 2 using this method and I can't wait to gloat.

I have two questions.  First, what are those images that Gandalf is seeing when his eyes are closed and what are their significance?

What kind of tape are you talking about?  What sort of material does it play?  And where did you get it.  Keep up the good work with OBE, hope to be there one day.

  While the more practice, the greater your chance of learning through experience, you can always practice by watching yourself fall asleep at night.  This is to give hope to all those who say, "But I don't have time to practice because I work a full time job, I have kids to take care of all day, etc."

Perhaps trying to see the day as dreamlike can be a good way to make all the day into practice, taking the practice of concentration and make it a part of the rest of life, making it fluid and lucid...

I use a cd I made from the "Sleep programming" ( positive sugestive affirmations) tape bought on this website.

It comes with the "4 tape set. Now available in CD form called "4 CD Set". I would get the cd set for $50.
<br>
<br>
The set has 6 different methods to project to find what works best for each individual. The Sleep programming tape is to be used with whatever you decide to use.

No I read it out of a book.  Albert Taylor.

Simply put. You are just waking up for a while in the middle of your sleep, splitting the nights sleep into 2 sections.   Example. You go to sleep and wake up or have your alarm wake you in 4 hours. You then get up for an hour and do something. you then go back to sleep.
