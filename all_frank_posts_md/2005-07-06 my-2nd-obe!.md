<section>
It's been several months now since I wrote here about my first OBE, where I had no sight, and just kinda floated up and down. I have no time to practice, except at bedtime, which of course ends up with me falling asleep. I haven't even had much of a chance to read many posts here at this site. But today I had some time in the middle of the day, and I got results!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I got my 2nd OBE, and 1st OBE from waking consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I've really been wanting to try the phasing method. But that's not what I got today, even though doing run downs put me in a relaxed state where I did not notice my physical body. After more than an hour of relaxing,  (having to start again sometimes because something made me return to C1), some vibrations hit me. The vibrations started because some sort of noise that "happened" in the room gave me a small jump, and that started the vibrations. I read somewhere once, that that's one guy's whole method! Relax and wait for a noise that always seemed to come along that would give him a start, and then the vibrations would start.
<br>
<br>
(I understand that many people do not feel, and do not need to feel the vibrations in order to have an OBE)
<br>
<br>
I was able to do something with these vibrations, that I could NEVER do before - I could increase them! I've had full body vibrations before, very strong ones, but I could never increase them by will, no matter how I tried. Then they'd go away. These vibrations responded immediately to my intention. Then another thing happened. When I willed myself to float away from the bed, I felt it actually happen, whereas in the past, nothing happened!
<br>
<br>
It was my intention to float off the bed on to the floor, as I've read people do here. I thought while floating "This is it, if I am having an OBE it'll be a soft landing, if it's just me moving - I'll know". I felt myself fall off the bed, and the landing was ever so soft. I thought WOW! and opened my eyes, and as clear as ever I saw polished floorboards, the same as in my room. I was hitting it to test how real things felt. Everything looked and felt life-like. And that's the other thing, I could SEE this time!
<br>
<br>
The house was not where I lived, but I didn't care. I don't know where I was. It had high ceilings, and polished wooden floor, like where I live. But the house layout was different, and none of the stuff in it was mine. Except for the brightly sunlit bedroom I arrived in, the house was dim from having no lights on, but I could still see clearly. There was still some light around, it was not too dark. I was walking around the house. There were no people in the OBE besides me.
<br>
<br>
When I was in the loungeroom of this house it occurred to me to try to use this as a launch to f3. But maybe I haven't done enough reading on phasing yet. I was trying to get to the 3d blackness with stars by trying to picture it. Nothing happened. Perhaps I should have done it some other way. But I did not persist with this for more than a couple of tries. I didn't want to wake up. That's the other thing I noticed at this time... I am used to lucid dreams, and I can prevent myself from waking by spinning myself around. And because I am conscious in my lucid dreams, I also tend to wake soon after becoming lucid. As a result whenever a dream begins to fade, I spin into a new one. I also move around fast to keep myself thinking (conscious). I was moving around quickly today in my OBE too, but it was unnecessary, because it was so stable! Everything stayed the same. Even after closing my "eyes" to imagine this 3d blackness and express intent, I opened my eyes and was still in the same place. I began to fly around in the loungeroom bouncing off the walls. I felt full of tickling vibrations and energy rushes. I find it a bit uncomfortable, which is OK because they used to be unbearably uncomfortable when I used to practice, and I'd have to stop trying for an OBE.
<br>
<br>
After flying around this large, dark loungeroom, I decided I should call it quits and write it all down while I still remembered everything. I know it is important to keep early experiences short. But I had a false awakening and went into a dream. In my dream I was telling everyone all about it. I'm so relieved that after that dream, I could still remember the OBE. It'd be a shame otherwise.
<br>
<br>
The big progress for me since the last one was this:
<br>
<br>
I was able to drastically increase my vibrations through intention. In the past nothing would happen.
<br>
<br>
I was able to put up with the ticklishness of the vibrations. I hate them! Grr
<br>
<br>
I could feel a definate sense of movement as I felt I was floating off the bed on to the floor. It didn't feel imagined, though I know I wasn't really floating. It's all in the mind, I never went anywhere.
<br>
<br>
I could see, and see as clear as a bell. The floor felt as I expected when I hit it. I realise it was an epectation rather than a reality.
<br>
<br>
I was able to do this from a relaxed conscious state, and not from a dream!
<br>
<br>
Not once did I even THINK about my body, it's strange it never crossed my mind to look. (Thank goodness). I just got up and went out the bedroom door into a different house.
<br>
<br>
My surroundings looked real, and stable. Not at all like a dream.
<br>
<br>
All of these things I wanted to experience for myself. They are questions I've wondered about. I write all of this for people like myself who read about other people doing it, and wonder what it is like, or if it is true. I hope everyone who tries without success will persevere. It's taken me 18 months to get this far, and you can see it is not very far. I'm sure everyone who keeps at it will get there sooner or later.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading,
<br>

Hi Potatis
<img alt="" class="bbc_img" loading="lazy" src="http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0304/aktion/action-smiley-030.gif"/>
<br>
<br>
Good to see you around again – hope you are keeping well and happy.
<br>
<br>
And congratulations on your second OBE – great news!  Sounds like a brilliant experience and that fact that you didn't care that it wasn't your house must have made all the difference.  I know that when I find myself somewhere that I don't expect to be, I get confused and that has the effect of zapping me back to square one.
<br>
<br>
Writing it down in the detail you have is fantastic – this will really help too.
<img alt="" class="bbc_img" loading="lazy" src="http://www.click-smilies.de/sammlung0304/aktion/action-smiley-057.gif"/>
<br>
<br>
It sounds like you are going to be a natural.  Keep with it – I'll be coming to you for tips before too long!
<br>

Awesome!
<br>
<br>
It's posts like this that keeps me motivated. The more beginner experiences I read about, the more I realize "hey, I think can do that".

<section>
Sarah, I'm a long way from being a natural! lol. I read about people who have a hard time stopping themselves having an obe, and others who have just always had obes since childhood. No methods, no practicing. I'm so far at the opposite end to that, I'm amazed I got anywhere. I'm proof that nobody should think they can't do this. When I didn't get put off from being in the wrong house, it was because I just wanted to keep moving to experience as much as I could before I got dragged back. There was no time for "Hmm.. that's odd..?". Like it didn't seem odd that I was flying around this dim room bouncing off the walls. It was a funny thing that it did seem I could easily control my flying. It must have been my limited practice in lucid dreams.

It's nice to be back, thankyou.
<br>
<br>
I felt old fashioned writing my post, since everything seems to be about phasing now. While everyone else moves on, I'm only just getting to the RTZ, let alone to the area people call the "astral". No guides, no people to talk to, no dead pets, no standing in the middle of the road letting cars drive through me. I'm right at the beginning. The difference is, I know it's real and I know I can do it.
<br>
<br>
Stookie, that's why I wrote this post. It's not a far out experience compared to many you read here. But many times I've read about experiences that only seem to happen to OTHER people. You begin to wonder if you'll ever be able to do it. So eventually I was able to do what I've read other people have done, and eventually you will too. I've tried many different techniques, but moved forward significantly after trying the noticing method which quickly relaxes the body so you can barely feel it, then I start the rundown. Usually I fall asleep because I only have time to try it at bedtime, but when I tried it yesterday in the middle of the day, it worked first time!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Keep trying!
<br>
<br>
I forgot to write in my first post that although everything was dim in this house, one thing stood out. A digital clock, the kind you have by your bed. It had large, white flashing numbers 0:00 (no time?)
<br>
<br>
Don't anyone give up!

Potatis,
<br>
<br>
Great experience!  I'm with MT,  RTZ is hard to maintain, so count yourself lucky or a natural.. not such a bad thing.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Please don't let the wording muck you up, keep on posting those experiences.
<br>
<br>
Oh...I just commented myself to posting more of my experiences with that last line.....

<section>
Thanks Major Tom, Frank and Nay for your replies.
<br>
<br>
Major Tom, I tried the phasing again today without luck. I had more than an hour of staring at 2d black.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I was extremely relaxed though. I'm good now at quickly getting to Monroe's f3 with the noticing, and brain relaxing method. I got lots of other imagery, but no swirling colourful clouds, or stars. I've got more reading to do about phasing. It sounds easier than it is. Staring at 2d black for an hour believing sooner or later the swirly colours would come was a bit much, when nothing ended up happening. My body went to sleep, I could hear myself start to snore. Perhaps my mind was TOO awake? Sometimes though, my mind wandered off with the occasional imagery and then I'd snap back to fully alert again. Great, more 2d blackness to stare at again.
<br>
<br>
Nay, you know I'm always wanting to read your experiences. What's happened recently? Get posting!

Potatis
<br>
<br>
Staring at the 2D blackness for an hour isn't much fun, I agree.
<br>
<br>
I've found in my experience that I have to be in a certain relaxed state to get any swirly colours when I do the noticing exercise.  For instance, I tried it before sleep at night the other evening.  Spent about 20 minutes looking at the blackness, almost willing something to happen - nada.
<br>
<br>
Then earlier today I had a bash.  I got different shades, but nothing to really write home about.  I gave up after about 20 minutes again.
<br>
<br>
The best time for me is when I've just woken up, and before I've crammed my head with "what I'm going to/must do today" stuff.  I find I need the "
<i>
 dreamy - still a bit sleepy - nothing to get up for
</i>
" feeling for the exercise to really take effect.
<br>
<br>
However, the mental rundown I can do any old where.  I try not to do it when I'm driving
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
but I find this exercise much more intense in a way, because you really need to focus on what you are doing.  I think the more effort I put into it, the more I get out.
<br>
<br>
So, if you're bored lying there staring at the 2D blackness, create yourself a mental rundown instead to experiment with!
<br>
<br>
Sarah
