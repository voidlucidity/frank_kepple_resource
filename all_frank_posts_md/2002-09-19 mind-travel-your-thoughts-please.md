<section>
Hi all,
<br>
<br>
This morning I had a somewhat unexpected thing happen that I wanted to share a bit of, and get some opinions about.
<br>
<br>
I get to work sometimes up to two hours earlier than I have to (saving petrol by taking my wife to a nearby train station when she's on the early shift). my desk is in an out of the way spot, so I like to relax and meditate for a bit before the working day slaps me in the face. Its quiet except for the ever present soft drone of many computer fans around me.
<br>
<br>
I did just a few minutes of energy work, drawing energy, opening up the chakras, making them nice and tingly etc. Instead of focussing more on the energy, this time I just relaxed (office chair's quite comfy), letting waves of relaxation wash down my body. Pretty soon I  didn't want to move, so I felt myself kind of nestling down into this relaxation let go of my body and set my mind adrift.
<br>
<br>
It didn't drift - it shot straight up like a fish (or from my fishing ventures seaweed) caught by a jet assisted fishing line. It wasn't an OBE, I couldn't see or hear anything externally, but it was visionlike, in that my mind was producing the sights &amp; sounds internally.
<br>
<br>
I (well, my consciousness at least) ended up in like a cloud layer very high above the earth, standing on a misty platform, with my guide standing there waiting for me. She was very happy to see me, despite telling me off a little for being slack and not keeping in touch recently. She had a few things she needed to tell me, and when she was done, I felt myself drift back down and became more aware of the room around me.
<br>
<br>
That was it.  I've had a few visions lately, something that never used to happen, and I have been with my guide to this place "in the clouds" once before.
<br>
<br>
What I wanted to know is if anyone else has had similar forms of mind travel to this - not quite an OBE, but your thoughts travel to somewhere?
<br>
Also how far removed is this kind of thing from a full on OBE?
<br>
<br>
Yours in curiosity,
<br>
James.

<br>
Amazing, what you describe is basically the same as the focusing technique or "phasing in" technique that I've been practising the past 6 months, or so.
<br>
<br>
There is no real sensation of leaving your body. It's more of a shift in mental focus. It's based on the idea that wherever you place your focal point of awareness, that place becomes your reality.
<br>
<br>
Normally, for the great majority of people, their focal point of awareness is placed in physical world reality. But it is possible, given practice, to remove your focal point of awareness from the physical and place it in the Astral. As such, the Astral becomes your reality. The sensation is different to that of the traditional idea of an obe, in that there is no feeling of swapping bodies. It just feels like you shifted your mental focus and your surroundings changed.
<br>
<br>
From what you say I'm not sure what Focus level you were at. Guessing, I'd say it was Focus 12 (your guide will know). I'm fairly certain all the cloud scenary would have been created by your guide for effect (guides always approach in ways they feel will be most pleasant to their subject).
<br>
<br>
From that platform, it is possible to shift your mental focus up through the various levels. As you place your focal point of awareness in each level, whatever happens to be going on there immediately becomes your reality. Well, it sounds easy to say, but it's tricky to do. Ask your guide for some direct help. I'm sure she'll take pleasure in showing you around.
<br>

<section>
Frank,
<br>
I hadn't even considered that as a possibility. What a fascinating idea!
<br>
Would it be correct to compare the phasing in techniqe to mind travel?  It seems like something different again.
<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but to laugh afterwards when I thought about all the times you've mentioned not doing energy work, or going into deep meditation, but  just changing your focus and let it happen. Here's me busting a chakra trying to get some serious energy buzzes happening to launch my astral body, and instead I get further than I have before by simply relaxing and letting my mind off its leash. I have a feeling that I didn't entirely chose where my mind went though. I was kind of called.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank for giving me something to think about and some direction here. I've bookmarked Monroe's web site, so I think it's time to look at it a little closer.

James: I'm not sure what you mean by "mind travel" but I can definitely say, again, that what you describe in your original post is basically the same phasing-technique I have been teaching myself over the past months. Using this, you can go anyplace, anywhere on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Rather than talking about Astral planes or regions, as per tradition, Monroe labelled his experiences according to various states of mental focus. Next time you contact your guide, ask her for more info. I'm sure she will be only too pleased to help.
<br>
<br>
Another thing that you will find happen (if you continue down the Phasing road, which is more than a little weird to contemplate at first) is, rather than the usual experience of having feelings of travelling to the Astral in some kind of energy body, and so forth: it starts to get to the stage where it feels like you just simply remain still and the Astral "comes to you".
<br>
<br>
Next comes the realisation that "the Astral" was always there, all the time, right on the border of your imagination. All you did was open the door.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
I believe the term "mind travel" refers to sending your consciousness somewhere as apposed to sending your energy body somewhere.
<br>
Your description of phasing does sound different. This seems to more accurately describe the process of visions that I've been having recently. "The astral coming to me" describes it very well.
<br>
<br>
Would I be correct in thinking that the more I can practice this, the clearer and more detailed all the sensory input becomes?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info,
<br>
James.

<br>
<br>
Yes, perhaps even more so than the more traditional methods. I'm now getting to the stage where I don't have to even have my physical body in a *totally* relaxed state. There is a particular place in the brain that triggers the whole process and I'm finding that if I just basically relax and concentrate in a certain way, the Physical phases out and the Astral phases in.
<br>
<br>
Okay, I admit I've only been able to do this a few times. The latest was this morning where, in my mind, I was getting all the symtoms of making contact with the Astral but I was
<u>
 completely conscious
</u>
of my physical surroundings.
<br>
<br>
At first I thought, no, this must be a reality fluctuation of some kind. So I half sat up, physically, then pinched myself in the leg just to make absolutely sure I was 100% in the physical; which I was, yet, in my mind I knew connection with the Astral was imminent. So I lay back and let it continue whereupon all feeling of the Physical faded out and the Astral came into view.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping if I continue down my current path I will get to the stage where I can have complete control over whether I tune into Astral or Physical. And because it's just a simple "mind switch" there is less shock to the system. Which is why I wholeheartedly recommend this technique for beginners.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank,
<br>
This information of yours has really given me a lot of encouragement, thank you.
<br>
<br>
I have a strong desire to be able to better communicate with my guide. I know she is waiting to teach me many things. Until now I have been limiting myself  to working on "listening" better, for when she speaks into my conscious mind.
<br>
<br>
Now that I know how it is that I have been able to speak to her face to face on a couple of occasions, this has definitely opened the door for me to a whole new world of learning.
<br>
<br>
Greatfully,
<br>
James.

<section>
That sounds so similiar to what I term as my only OBE.  It was basically a total shift in reality but I never lost touch with my body, meaning I knew I was in my bed..  It is quite awsome to say the least..
<br>
<br>
I think this is why I am having trouble experiencing the traditional OBE where you float around in your room..because I keep expecting and wanting the astral...
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sounds like a great and beautiful experience James..  It has given me hope believe it or not..
<br>
<br>
Maybe one day I also will have a guide.  Sometimes in a waking state, I can nearly hear someone whisper to me..  I keep thinking it is my imagination, but it happens more and more often as I keep exploring the mystical side of things, by reading and practicing AD's focus techniques.
<br>
<br>
Please James, if this happens again, could you update this post and you too Frank..  These are both very very interesting views on this subject..
<br>

Sincerely,
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Jenn: If I may directly ask, what is it, exactly, you are attempting to accomplish?
<br>
<br>
Also, you say, "One day I also will have a guide". You've probably got them all around you, stacking up in six-packs. On the Astral, guides are all over the place. You just need to become open to them.
<br>
<br>
You say, "It has given me hope". Hope for what?
<br>
<br>
Also, where you say you hear some kind of vocal guidance but dismiss this as "imagination"... could I please strenuously point out that the higher imagination *is* your direct connection with the Astral. It is the very faculty within you that you use in order to make full contact.
<br>
<br>
If you go and dismiss that, communicating will become like if you were trying to speak to someone on the phone when the plug had been pulled from the wall-socket.
<br>
<br>
Tisha made a quote from a book the other day saying that the Astral was as close to you as your face. No, I disagree, it's even closer.

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
I recently purchased AD and have started practicing some things.  But let's go back before that.  For a year, I have been trying to have another experience similiar in form to my only OBE.  It was along the lines of something visionary and by that I mean the sights there was NOT like what one would experience in an astral projection, such as lifting out of body.  Since I received the book and have been practicing focused visualization and spot focus, the whispers have started.  So it is a new thing to me..
<br>
<br>
So, if the whispers are a guide or a series of guides, how do I achieve direct communication and know whether it is one, or more than one?  An example of these whispers would be yesterday:  While washing dishes in my house, I had a quick thought go through my head about something. It was not quite a voice but a random thought that spoke and said something about {it is very difficult to say in retrospect as they are so elusive after the fact} a thread on this forum and it was so strong I went and looked and had received an answer in my pm mail from James S and it was about something I already knew from the whisper. {do you know this sounds nutty to me??} These whispers are happening every day now and have been for several days.  I have been doing this focused visualization for about 5 to 6 days now.  That's about how long I have had the book.  Maybe they were always there but I am only just able to hear them or sense them..  Can that be true? And do I hear them or sense them?  Which is it?
<br>
<br>
Hope:  I hope to repeat my experience or something like it.  Maybe not necessarily go to the same place but hope to possibly repeat the same sort of visionary experience.  Reading the thread was great for me.  It ... gave me hope... and in readng others accounts, expecially in how they are trying to achieve this... is wonderful to me and gives me insightful ideas on how to achieve my own means.  And also understand what is going on which is a big plus with me.
<br>
<br>
In trying to repeat or open myself up this last year, so many things happened that make sense now that didn't before {from reading the AD book} and have ALL occured during the last year.  Example: I don't suffer from high blood pressure or have an unusual rapid heart beat, but we do in our household have the means to check out blood pressure and our heartrate.  Before I get to my heart rate, let me say one more thing. The last year I have struggled with many many beliefs, one of the main ones "chakras" and of their existance.  Still, even though I was doubtful on that one point, I did energy raising techniqes based on nothing but breathing energy to try and achieve a higher vibrational state which was easy for me and successful to some extent.  I had had many energy fluctuations occur during this that couldn't be contributed to anything else but energy.
<br>
<br>
Several time, sitting on the couch OR while laying in bed at night, I would feel an enormous surge of pressure or chest energy, very rapid heart rate and it would occur without concentrating on anything {watching tv or sleeping} and I would be convinced of the fact that I needed my blood pressure checked or my heart rate checked.  I would see bright energy spots in the air in front of me {thought it was blood pressure} and I would feel my chest pounding and pounding and  I would feel very very lightheaded and "tall", like a disassociation or something. If I had to describe this feeling, it would be like my neck had grown about 3 feet longer.  I would see things from a different vantage point  but was still quite connected to my body but just felt taller.. hehe  {seriously}  My husband would check my pulse and take my blood pressure and I would be normal.  Nothing measurable wrong with me.  I understand what this was now.  My heart chakra was open and receptive..  I get it now... I believe.
<br>
<br>
Things are falling into place for me energy wise, and the more I am receptive to it, the more it happens but sometimes it is like it is on autopilot and controlled by something other than me like when I'm sleeping or watching tv.  Energy is a constantly occuring process where I am concerned..  I am come to love how it makes me feel and I am not afraid anymore of these feeling..  And I know my heart is not really racing and my blood pressure is fine.
<br>
<br>
This might explain a little more than what you asked but I like your feedback..
<br>
<br>
Thanks, Jenn {aka Blossom}

Thank you for the extensive reply. It's always good to hear of people's experiences, and you appear to be making good progress. As I touched on in my previous post, the thing you need to do is accept what comes through as "real" and please don't just dismiss it as just your imagination.
<br>
<br>
Though I do accept, at first, it does appear that what you are perceiving is merely your imagination. But that is because what we call Imagination is, in fact, an information channel; with all our day-to-day concerns going on at one end, and the Astral is connected to the other.
<br>

I have something of an update -
<br>
<br>
Since the first experience I detailed I've been working on the same methods that got me there - bit of energy &amp; chakra work, relaxing, etc.
<br>
<br>
This morning, I was setting my mind adrift again, but seemed to be really struggling to keep my point of focus. My mind would start to drift a little way in front of my body, and I would feel as if I am in a bubble, spinning slightly as I drift. Every time I would start getting comfortable in this bubble, I would spin around enough to face my body and POP! Back where I started again, the focus completely gone.
<br>
<br>
Maybe it comes down to not really having a reason behind what I was doing, other than to see if I could.
<br>
<br>
Oh well...
<br>
<br>
James.

<section>
Thanks for the input MajorTom.
<br>
<br>
Since my last post on this topic I have been successful in once more getting my consciousness to "go it alone", and again visit my guide in the astral. At this stage it seemed there had to be a need to do so, otherwise my focus just isn't there and I end up dropping off to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I'm glad you corrected the second name in your post. Robert Bruce's methods have not worked for me, and I was starting to get a little frustrated. I now consider that there is really no right or wrong way to learn the art of AP, there is only the way that works for you personally. Wether you use  Bruce's methods or Monroe's, if it works, it's all good.
<br>
<br>
I find the "phasing"  as Frank describes it to be much simpler, however I have gained some absolutely wonderful "side effects" from trying RB's NEW and attempting AP that way.
<br>
<br>
You are right, getting your consciousness out and about is the main thing. If you can talk your energy body into tagging along, then that's good too, but not always necessary. I agree too that we
<i>
 should
</i>
trust our own experiences. If they help us to grow and learn then that's what counts.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
<br>
James.

<section>
The methods described in this post seem extremely similar to what I've been doing for the past few months.  I have very little dificulty inducing OBE's.  However, I also find "phasing" into other areas of consciousness focus much easier and also much more rewarding.  I generally don't have great earth shattering experiences while OBE in the technical sense of being in the second energy body flying around the real time zone.  Tuning my consciousness to higher levels directly almost always leaves me with a memorable and valuable experience.

Chris,
<br>
Gotta agree with you there. Having lacked the full on energy-body-wandering-around-the-house-in-real-time experience I have been more than happy with the results from projecting my conscoiousness alone. The info I've gained from spending time in this state has been mind-numbing.
<br>
<br>
MajorTom - yep, agree with you also.
<br>
More and more it seems to me there is no right or wrong ways of doing AP, especially as there seems to be so many different way scoming to light, all of which come with great benefits.
<br>
<br>
It's all good.
<br>
James.
