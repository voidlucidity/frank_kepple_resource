Hey guys! I'm totally new to all this but a friend has been telling me all about astral projection and I'm really interested in all that sort of stuff in general. Anyways, I was barely awake this morning and realized that astral projection is really easy in this state between sleep and being awake. I started to concentrate on relaxing my body but making sure my mind was totally awake. In less than a minute I was paralyzed and totally relaxed so I just rested in this state for a bit. After about another minute I started pulling on the rope to get my spirit out of my body because I figured that would be be the easiest way too get out. I did this still relaxing and everything and then I had a vision or dream or something of me hanging on a rope attached to the ceiling at the mall (i know, weird place) and my body was still in bed just looking up at myself. I thought I was suppose to be the one on the rope looking down at myself! I don't remember anything that happened after this. Any thoughts?
<br>
Thanks!

Dream, obe, or ap...
<br>
<br>
Basically there is no real difference as they are all founded on the same basis. So I guess the answer is yes.

Hello Miranda
<br>
<br>
As Frank says, vision or dream, that's irrelevant.  I had a similar experience where I had a traditional OBE, and I was walking up our road, very familiar, when out of the blue, the whole scene changed and there were talking monkeys ahead of me, and one of them wore a hat.  I won't elaborate, as I've posted about that particular experience before
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
but suffice to say that strange things do happen.
<br>
<br>
I've also experienced dual vision, if you like, where you assume your visual perspective is from your "second" body, however, it is actually from your physical body, whereas your consciousness remains in the second body.  I had an experience where I was aware of
<u>
 three
</u>
different aspects of myself, which was quite strange looking back on it, although at the time, it was quite
<i>
 acceptable
</i>
.  I was totally conscious when I had this experience.
<br>
<br>
Next time it happens, try experimenting slowly and surely.
<br>
<br>
And always remember to have fun!

I've experienced similar to this duel vision

I was in bed looking at the ceiling, thinking to myself. Yet at the same time I was in a garden, talking to someone about OBEs with a different visual scene and a different independent consciousness. Hard to explain but in two places at once with two independent consciousness at the same time, both being aware of the other and feeling/seeing/thinking it all at the same time.
