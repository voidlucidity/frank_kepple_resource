<section>
Even if astral projection its a real thing, how can you tell that API its not a creation of your minds? Maybe API its just a thought form created in the exact moment that you AP, but a personal API...so ever time anyone makes AP, it will always see a personal API and not a common API, a common thought form that its not exactly subjective.
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, how can you have shure that API its a thought form that its the same (Almost) to everyone?
<br>
<br>
For example, imagine that i never read anything about API. The only thing that i know tits that there is one API, i know its picture and i know how to phase there. But i dont know any details abou it..lets say that you guys have created a big table made of diamons and with a triangular shape (something that would never occur to me because thats a wierd table).
<br>
<br>
Now, you guys know that such table exists, but i dont. So, if i phase into AP, the proof that its real its the fact that i must see such table (lets suppose that i explore all the island of course) and all  other details about the island. I know that AP world its not "unchangble" like ours and many details wiill be different to everyone (for example a small lamp may look like green to one but to other guy it may look transparent, etc) but big details will not escape. The table for instance.
<br>
<br>
So, do you have these kind of proofs that API exists almost by itself?
<br>
<br>
thanks

Hi Kaz
<br>
<br>
I know what you're getting at, but how do you know anything exists by itself?
<br>
<br>
What if I asked you during one of your dreams, "Hey Kaz my dear friend, do you really believe that the chair you are sitting on is 'real'?"
<br>
<br>
If you are not lucid, then you'll laugh at me and say, "Don't be silly Sarah, of course it's real, I'd fall to the floor if it wasn't..."
<br>
<br>
So, is the chair real or not?
<br>
<br>
Likewise, the sheep in the field that you pass on your way to work.  It exists when you pass it.  How do you know it is still existing when you're at work?  I know the farmer could ring you up and tell you that the very same sheep is baaaing away in the field while you are busy at work, and he could even get the sheep to baaaa down the phone to you, but is it not possible that it is all a product of your mind - even the farmer?
<br>
<br>
Now I'm digging myself into a hole, that I won't be able to get out of because I'm not clever with words, but hopefully you will get my point.
<br>

<section>
i know that, i know that all that we see may be an illusion but my question stills not being answered. Forget the "matrix" idea.
<br>
We say that our world its "objective" because there are common things in it for every human. You see the same chair i see. I know that you can start theorize a lot just about this idea (the chair) but all i want its a simple question.
<br>
<br>
Everyone knows what i mean about "API being real". We cannot go into exagerations or everything must believed (if we start going on with your idea, we must believe in green cows). With all  respect, i think that such kind of tought its good for theory...what i am asking its a more pratical question.
<br>
<br>
If you dont like my question, maybe i could rephrase it: do you report common  while in API? For example, lets suppose that you and more 100 guys visit API and everyone (after coming back) write in  a paper what he/she saw (before speaking with each other). After that they show their papers to each other and the majority of the group (lets say 70%) will report the same things.
<br>
<br>
For example, suppose that someone created a big sphere with the face of Buddha painted on it, levitating 1mile above the API (the sphere its very big). The guy that putted the sphere on API, didnt say that to anyone. Next day a bunch of guys visit the API ant about 50-70% of the guys reported the view of a sphere with such characteristics (maybe some of them will see something slightly different, because AP world still being vulnerable to thoughts).
<br>
<br>
If such thing happens (common report with no preview knowledge) we must adit that API its very real, if not API its not an objective world like i would expect (call it "very subjective world" if you want).
<br>
<br>
So, my question its very simple: have you guys reported such kind of things that prove that API its a "somewhat [at least] objective world"?.
<br>
<br>
thanks.
<br>
<br>
Selski, dont be offended but you didnt answered my question the way i expected but i aprreciate very much your help

<section>
I wondered about this too.. I look at the picture,
<br>
I have went there &amp; well, how do I know it's the "real one"...
<br>
Is there such a thing as the real one? Who says?
<br>
When I went, I didn't stay long &amp; no one was there.
<br>
<br>
I think it appears just how I imagine it to be...
<br>
Do enough people really believe in it to make it stable?
<br>
Wouldn't that take a lot of constant attention?
<br>
<br>
Maybe it exists somewhere but it's just not the third dimension.

hi,
<br>
I think that you will be able to see the island objectively if you see it with your objective mind. The problem is that we keep on perceiving everything with our interpreter mind...our ego. So if you will manage to leave your ego behind, the chances are that you will be able to see the island objectively. But I must say, that I still don't understand perceiving things that have been created in our minds only. An example: sometime ago I did this experiment with one of the members who left a sword in the pyramid. I did go and I saw a sword...but it wasn't the one he showed me later. It came out that he never saw the sword "physically" only on a picture (a pencil sketch)..there might be 3 reasons for my mistake ( or both at once)..
<br>
1. I'm dumb and the non physical world does not exist.
<br>
2. My ego knows better...but doesn't know much about swords so showed me the only one it knew.
<br>
3. the guy with whom I did the experiment did not have enough "contact"  with the object so as to put a strong enough intent for me to see it clearly. I also believe that a good physical contact with the person with whom you're doing the experiment is a huge benefit.
<br>
<br>
The same situation (in my beliefs) is with heaven and hell. Yeah they exist. But they exist because so many people believe in them..thoughts materialize, and just imagine how strong the "image" of those places must be if so many people believe in them. But because everybodys thoughts are a bit different, both heaven or hell will look a little bit different to everyone...also..the places are so huge that if you go there chances of seeing something exactly the same as your partner did are almost impossible (unless you make the intention to see the same).
<br>
Look at the 1st "what's in the box" experiment with the apple. I believe that it's a huge success a proves that the all of this is possible.
<br>
<br>
I should have found some reference...but this is the only thing I found for now..it talks about about perceiving after death..but looking at it from an angle which says that death doesn't exist, it shouldn't really matter.

 Does everyone see the same or different stuff in the Afterlife?
 <br>
 Imagine the Afterlife is a lot like the New World discovered By Columbus in 1492. Now, imagine a person arrived alone, ten years before Columbus. This New World would appear differently, depending upon where the person landed. If he landed in the middle of a barren, uninhabited desert, his experience would be quite different than landing in the village of an indigenous tribe. So, depending on where in the Afterlife a person "lands," his or her experience will be different. Why people "land" in different parts of the Afterlife and see different "stuff" seems to be dependent upon several things such as beliefs held prior to death; circumstances of death; habitual patterns of thinking; diseases which alter the thinking process (such as Alzheimer's Disease); and others.

thanks
<br>
<br>
i will read that thing sabout the "whats in the box"
<br>
<br>
is that here in API forums? if i dont fing i will ask you again if you dont mind.
<br>
<br>
about heaven and hell...i think (just think) that heaven its a little different from APIsland, because heavne may have been created by pther entitys (be it angels or gods, whatever)...so maybe heavne its not so vulnerable to thoughts.

Is API in focus 2 or focus 3 of Franks linear model?  I think this could clear up a lot on this question.  Because, with my understanding, if it is focus 2 then every ones API could be different, and It would be hard to meet up with Astral pulse members.  However, if it is in Focus 3 then every ones API should be similar and people should be able to meet each other.  Maybe someone more advanced could comment on this.

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
It will begin as an individual thing, a creation of each person's individual area within Focus 2. But the more people think about it as being an objective entity it will begin to form within Focus 3 "for real" as it were.

Hehehe..that is the clincher isn't it Frank?
<br>
<br>
I've tried so many times to get there AND stay there, for it only to slip right through.  Now after months of doing it and reading other accounts, my only explanation would be that it isn't quite stable yet.
<br>
<br>
It seems to shift so quickly that I can't keep up..(if that makes sense..
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
)  So many people adding their thoughts and what nots have left me scrambling..lol
<br>
<br>
I know the darn thing is there, but it doesn't seem solid to me...like I said, always shifting.

So you mean that the physical earth has not been created by other entities??

<section>
on what Nay said,
<br>
<br>
Ive heard it said that different states of vibration will cause you to end up on different levels, levels of what i dunno...............
<br>
<br>
If this is correct, is it possible that the island is at a specific vibration that only a select few get to naturally?Maybe one needs to go astral and try and achieve the same vibrational state? And the reason for the "Shifting" might be that youre seeing what i would say an echo effect if you will........its vibrating at level 5 for eg, but youre vibrating a bit slower or faster, but you see the ripple effect that the islands vibration makes in the astral, if this type of scenario exists of course...........the image would be clear at level 5 but further up or down on the vibration rates the vividness of the place or image would have lost intensity or power?
<br>
<br>
Hope i am making sense........i tend to think weird.......hehehehe
