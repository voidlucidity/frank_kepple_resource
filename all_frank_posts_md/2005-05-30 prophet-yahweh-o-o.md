 Prophet Yahweh has resurrected the lost, ancient art of summoning UFOs and actual spaceships on command. Over 1,500 sightings have appeared to him since 1979.

A bit unconventional for a 'prophet' to charge for his services.

Apparently he's going to be summoning publicly though, for those that don't want to pay the $8 I suppose, from July 1 to June 15.

 For only 45 days, starting June 1st until July 15, 2005, Prophet Yahweh, Seer of Yahweh, will be calling down UFOs and spaceships for the news media to film and photograph. During this time, a spaceship will descend, on Prophet's signal, and sit in the skies over Las Vegas, Nevada for almost two days.

Ha ha, thanks for posting that. I enjoy a good chuckle. As June 1st is tomorrow the first news of these "UFO" sightings should be coming through the main news channels from just after midnight if the old "Prophet" is correct. Just too many drugs and too little time, eh, Prophet Yahweh.
<br>
<br>
How is it these, so called, Prophets always claim to be able to see the future but forever fail to see when they are about to be proved wrong. :)
<br>
<br>
Would be nice if he were right, though. I always wanted to go for a ride in an alien spaceship. Imagine going for a quick trip around Mars and back. Sure would be a hoot, IMO. Can't see why people in Las Vegas should get all the luck. Why can't he bring one over here? There's a nice big field out the back they could land on.
<br>
<br>

On the subject of your apology, I think we should declare a "sarcastic amnesty" for this thread for the next month. I am not sure if I am in my rights to do that. Okay, I'll put my moderator hat on and declare a sarcastic amnesty for this thread for one month from today. If I'm out of order then I'll get shot down within a few hours.

I was watching one of the videos, LA3 it was. For proof simply keep a close eye on time index - 6.40 to 6.45.
<br>
<br>
It is here that the so-called sphere, although far far away in the sky, passes below a telephone line.
<br>
<br>
I feel dirty for spending this much time watching these videos. Maybe i could have done something more productive... Like... Cut my toe nails.

Anyhow, if your interested, check it out. Any theories on how they accomplished the illusion could make for an interesting topic.

It doesn't pass below the line. The camera is focused to infinity and the line is blurred. From this comes the effect of it being transparent. I can do similiar photos for an example with moon and some kind of cable. The effect of transparency is further enhaced by video compression.
<br>
The possibility of it being a baloon is not real too, judging from the way it moves.
<br>
I think that the shpere could not be added using computer program, unless someone have far-above than average skills.(Notice how camera's autofocus "catches" it, and the movement of camera operator's hands blur it)
<br>
The only way this could be a hoax is that it's some kind of promotion action for some movie -  only then they could hire computer graphics experts good enough to do it and pay the news station to broadcast it.
<br>
The interesting thing is that I've seen that "metal ball" object floating on many other photos and even on satellite photos on Google Maps.

<br>
Would have to be pretty elaborate, and have some pretty good acting on the part of the news team. Everything from the skeptical reporter calling back his boss for a change in plans for the story or however he put it, to the amused/skeptical reaction from the staff and the meterologist remarking how he could explain it scientifically (I'd also like to know what he was thinking - but he said he wouldn't comment :-/).
<br>
<br>
I didn't watch the clips from the news until after I posted the first post, but I wasn't expecting it to look that convincing. If that thing is actually at the height that the video actually suggests, unless those clouds were deceivingly low, it would be moving pretty damned fast.
<br>

Well, it has been the first of June for a while and the UFO silence is so silent it's almost deafening. Neither CNN nor the BBC are reporting spaceships over Las Vegas. Perhaps it is all a big conspiracy. Spaceships have landed in "Area 57" and they are taking right now to the "CIA" regarding their proposed "world take over". Yep, that's it. I just need to know the end game. Let me take another line of this little powder here and chew on some Shrooms and it'll come to me. :)

CaCoDeMoN,
<br>
<br>
I'm no expert, and it seems apparent that you have more of a know-how with regards to cameras focusing to infinity than I.

However my original sentiment remains true, let a massive mother ship float over his head the size of a stadium, let the people flee from there cars while looking skyward, then we'll talk.

I just took a look at the first link of the original post (only looked at the second before). But it would appear we should be advised that, "Yahweh and his angels are superhuman beings on other planets who fly in spaceships."
<br>
<br>
Really...
<br>
<br>
Mr Yahweh, didn't you know that my dad was an astronaut? And another thing, the moon is made of Swiss cheese, seriously, and there's a man in it. And get this, yep, Santa Clause is a real person! Oh and the cheque is in the post, lol.
<br>
<br>
Someone should tell this jerk that we are living in the 21st century, not the first. Mr Yahweh, you do not look "superhuman" to me. You actually look like you are half asleep. Couldn't resist a little toke before the camera shot I suppose.
<br>
<br>
You have 44 days to produce a spaceship over Las Vegas.

Whatever is that object in the footage, its not computer generated, this I'm sure.

A very bad camera work indeed.
<br>
Its almost the size of an airplane, (you can guess the size when it passes through the clouds),so it can't be a balloon.

I dont want to comment on the man, but you'd find that 90% of such public info on net is "funny", because when you dont want to tell and there is a required field (mostly a choice type), you choose any random answer.
<br>
We all do this, so to me its not funny or useful or a source to draw any conclusions except that he looks like an average guy.

Well, they are straightforward answers. And these same answers occur in million other profiles. So there is nothing to be concluded about the 'prophet'.
<br>
One must try to validate the ufo phenomena he has shown to the TV guys. If they confirm its not a balloon, then we have a mystry to solve.
<br>
Although asking for $$ to view the videos leaves no doubts that he is after money, still its interesting that he could show a giant metal ball in the sky and everyone is quiet about it.

Giant metal balls making funny movements are two a penny. The Prophet has clearly stated that he will produce a spaceship over Las Vegas within 36 days from now. We are waiting. I'm chuckling already, but will reserve judgement for 37 days.

Hi:

I've been spoilt now the moment he talked about that spacecraft hovering over Las Vegas. I've always wanted to see a real live alien spacecraft and would very much love to go for a quick trip around Mars and back. So the odd metal ball here and there no longer cuts it I'm afraid. But a huge spacecraft just hovering there, wow, that really gets my juices flowing that does.

Gday!
<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to assume that any highly intelligent beings would allow us to evolve according to our own design... The concept of extra-terrestrial visitation is obviously a mael-storm of controversy... No one seems to have their finger on it.. Do they exist?? Or don't they? Who are they? WHy don't they come down and visit us???
<br>
<br>
I sense your pent up frustration... However.. may I suggest that you re-direct your frustrations.. and try to understand why you are angry.. and attempt to replace that anger.. with understanding.. consoiusness and love...
<br>
<br>
Another question you might add to your inventory... What does your government stand to lose.. if aliens were to come down and 'show us'??? Would that not mean that many of the religous might change there ideals?? Do you really know how much power institutions such as the vatican have???...
<br>
<br>
Another idea..

come on this guy is real,
<br>
<br>
hes summoned these ufos on COMMAND for ABC News even!
<br>
hes seen thousands of these and have recorded many of these on camera.
<br>
he gives away his movies for free and donates all of them to public domain and he has no profit motive. He would be a fraud if he charged for his stuff, but he doesnt, he gives away everything for free.

you cant fake these things on abc news, watch it for yourself.
<br>
<br>
the 150,000 thing in his personal ad he said on a radio show was that he was looking for a wife and he put the 150,000 to weed out the gold diggers and only meet women who would like him for who he was.
<br>
<br>
www.pyah.tv check out his group and see all his other ufos and teachings and stuff he gives out like daily.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You say giving everything away for free, but that is not what I saw when I originally looked at his website. Anyhow, if what he maintains is correct we shall see a giant spaceship hovering over Las Vegas in the next few weeks. We won't have to click on some obscure Internet TV channel it'll be all over the world's mainstream media. But if we don't then that will tell me all I need to know about Mr Yahweh.
<br>

he did that to pay for bandwith to stream the videos. Bandwith is not free.

was taken down, and he refunded all money because it went to bandwith for the movies, which he no longer hosts himself anymore. He now gives out every single video ever made out via freeupload services now and no longer needs to charge for bandwith.

www.pyah.tv is his new site and he has links to the videos.

That's true. You can get the videos for free at his new yahoo group site. I guess he just forgot to take the old site down, or update the old pages or whatever. He's also getting ready to re-encode his free videos to larger format, and distribute them for free via Bit Torrent.
<br>
<br>
What do the people that thought he was in it only for money have to say now?
<br>
<br>
Also, I don't believe he is using balloons. I don't know if it's aliens either, but it's all entertaining nevertheless. lol

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I don't care whether he is in it for the money or not. I just wanna see that big spaceship hovering over Las Vegas. In a sense, I hope he can do it. If it were genuine and he really can communicate across actual dimensions, and that spaceship did actually come about, then that would really be something! Wow, wouldn't it just. Because there ARE many other physical-world dimensions and they all occupy the SAME physical space.
<br>
<br>
I was only talking a few weeks ago about how it should theoretically be possible to construct some kind of craft that would actually transport us
<i>
 between
</i>
dimensions.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

 It is reasonable to assume that any highly intelligent beings would allow us to evolve according to our own design... The concept of extra-terrestrial visitation is obviously a mael-storm of controversy... No one seems to have their finger on it.. Do they exist?? Or don't they? Who are they? WHy don't they come down and visit us???

 I sense your pent up frustration... However.. may I suggest that you re-direct your frustrations.. and try to understand why you are angry.. and attempt to replace that anger.. with understanding.. consoiusness and love...
 <br>

<br>
It's also reasonable to assume that highly intelligent beings have no compassion or love or no soul.
<br>
<br>
People see them all the damn time so they are not allowing us to evolve on our own design, it only takes one instance of them interfering to blow a hole in that theory.
<br>
<br>
For instance you use the term highly intelligent I will assume we are less than highly intelligent as the human race, with that I am walking down the street.  I hear a car crash. Its your family's car, the car is about to ignite and burn your entire family to death. As a less intelligent being, I run to the car and help all of your family out. I don't know you or any of them but my compassion, love for my fellow human beings and love for life drives me to help them.
<br>
<br>
Now the highly evolved beings watch us on earth kill each other in war, children suffer and stave all over the world, corruption, cheat, rape, murder, struggle to do better or struggle down the wrong path etc..................
<br>
<br>
If they are so highly evolved where is the compassion to help or the love.
<br>
<br>
Enough is enough. They need to step forward now.
<br>
<br>
Show by example.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
According to reports Mr Yaweh is the only person who passed Mr Randi's initial test of possible genuineness to date. It would appear they have arranged for a test "summoning" of an unidentified flying object to take place early next year. January, I believe.
<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Mr Yahweh has 19 days to produce a spaceship hovering over Las Vegas.

Prophet Yaweh appears to have alot of hate and anger.  This is from his yahoo group and there is much more. Listen to the link below on How to summon.  It has nothing to do with summoning. It only spews hate and anger. A so called man of a loving God appears to spew hate.

Dear pystudents and pyufos,
<br>
<br>
There is only about 12 days left before July 15, 2005.
<br>
<br>
Today, while typing, I heard the voice that calls itself YAHWEH say:
<br>
<br>
"THIS IS A SACRED MOMENT. SEND OUT NO MORE EMAILS UNTIL MY ANGEL'S CHARIOT DESCENDS DOWN FOR YOU TO FILM. NOW FOCUS AND PREPARE YOUR MIND FOR THIS GREAT MOMENT FOR IT WILL COME DOWN FOR YOU TO SEE AND FILM AS I HAD YOU PROPHECISE THAT IT WOULD DO. RELAX YOUR MIND. READ NOTHING. AND PREPARE YOUR HEART FOR THE EVENT'S FULFILLMENT THAT IS NEAR. IT SHALL BE DONE. IT WILL APPEAR OVER LAS VEGAS FOR ALL TO SEE."
<br>
<br>
Because of this, I will not send you anymore emails or read any of your emails to me until after YAHWEH chariot comes down over Las Vegas.
<br>
<br>
THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAR FROM ME, I WILL BE LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE SPACESHIP IS IN THE AIR OVER LAS VEGAS AND YOU FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN COME HERE TO SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES AND VIDEO TO COME TO MY SUMMONING SITE.
<br>
<br>
AT THAT TIME, I WILL LET YOU KNOW THEY DIRECTIONS TO IT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE VIEW OF THE SHIP.
<br>
<br>
Until then, I bid you farewell.

Randi can only see so many people so he picks ones that seem interesting or draw a lot of attention.  PY qualifies for both, but by no means has PY passed any of Randi's tests.

The false prophet sent email to everyone today that his yahweh was not going to show the spaceship.  Rather his yahweh told him to eat, go back to Los Angeles, work out at the gym, take boxing, and maybe in July 2006 he would show his spaceships.  The false prophet said that his yahweh did not show the spaceship because the media did not show up.
<br>
<br>
Don't lose hope!  As much as the debunkers and false prophets will try to destroy spiritualism and the belief in God, don't lose hope!
<br>
<br>
I was told that the one who speaks to the false prophet as yahweh comes from a higher dimensional planet near the Pleiades who is a renegade.  I would have been surprised if this being would be allowed to show a mother ship in Earths atmosphere for 1.5 days.  There were many who did spiritual battle to stop it.

You people would have known this early yesterday if you were subscribed to his yahoo group.  Although I can't blame you for not wanting to get his emails.  Below I will post just a few of his emails to the group.

 Dear pystudents and pyufos,
 <br>
 <br>
 I received the email, below, from one of you about what I had to say if no spaceship appeared before the July 15th deadline.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have received many others asking the same questions.
 <br>
 <br>
 Here are the questions and below it are my answers to those questions:
 <br>
 <br>
 ............................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 &gt; Hello, What will you do if at the morning of july the 16th no spaceship has descneded from sky to fulfill your prophecy? Could you please tell us what to expect from our pystudent-group's teacher if this situation occurs? Lots of us have told many of our friends that a spaceship would come from the sky and sit over las vegas for a day and a half and commited our faith in you. I'd personnaly would like to know what you think you'll probably do if nothin happens and your prophecy isn't fulfilled so I'll probably know better what to say to all my family and friends who trust what I am telling them as of today, july 14th...
 <br>
 <br>
 ............................................................

 <br>
 This event I started from June 1 - July 15, 2005 was billed as a media only event.
 <br>
 <br>
 It was for the media only, and the public was not invited.
 <br>
 <br>
 I even turned away people who were coming to Las Vegas because the event was not for the public.
 <br>
 <br>
 I made it clear from the beginning that this event was for the media and that the sightings I prophecized of was going to appear for the cameras of the media to film.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you go to the press release below, you will see that this is true; in it I said:

 "For only 45 days, starting June 1st until July 15, 2005, Prophet Yahweh, Seer of Yahweh, will be calling down UFOs and spaceships for the news media to film and photograph. During this time, a spaceship will descend, on Prophet's signal, and sit in the skies over Las Vegas, Nevada for almost two days... But, starting June 1st until July 15th (45 days) Prophet is going public by opening up to the news media. He will demonstrate his ability to call down UFOs and spaceships, on-demand, for them to film and photograph."
 <br>

 Also, in my releases to my groups, since this thing started, I said the following:

 "In the visions, I saw myself calling all the TV stations in the Las Vegas area and talking to them. I heard myself saying something about them bringing their cameras before me so I can summon for them. This I have not done! Only a couple of TV stations contacted me.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 "After seeing me aggressively contacting the TV stations here, I heard the following words:
 <br>
 <br>
 "THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST DO. SUMMON ONLY FOR TELEVISION STATIONS. SPREAD YOUR HANDS ONLY FOR TELEVISION STATIONS. NOW YOU ARE IN TUNE WITH ME AND MY WILL FOR YOU."

 Dear List,
 <br>
 <br>
 Last night, while sleep, I heard the following words from the voice that calls itself YAHWEH:
 <br>
 <br>
 "CALL ALL LOCAL TELEVISIONS STATIONS AND TELL THEM TO ASSIGN YOU A DEDICATED CAMERA TEAM WHOSE JOB IS TO DO NOTHING BUT COVER YOUR SUMMONINGS TO ME FOR THE UFOS AND SPACESHIP. TELL THEM TO NOT AIR ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER EVERY THING IS DONE WHEN THEY HAVE ALL THEY SIGHTINGS THEY NEED AND THE SPACESHIP TO PROVE THAT WE EXIST AND THAT MY DELEGATION IS HERE READY TO INTERVENE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD. FOR THE MOMENT IS OURS AND THE MOMENT IS AT HAND. FOR I WILL DESCEND IN A SPACESHIP FOR ALL TO SEE. AT THAT TIME, I WANT TO BE FILMED BY LOCAL TV NEWS."

 <br>
 Subject: Revelations/Instructions Received - No. 3
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 "TAKE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GO GIVE IT TO HIM AND TELL HIM THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE AND GET THE RIGHTS TO USE THE PROPERTY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 45 DAYS. SUMMON ONLY THERE FOR NOW ON; YOU GAVE THE MEDIA A CHANCE TO PICK THE PLACE AND TIME. FORGET THAT NOW. DON'T FOLLOW THEIR DICTATES ANYMORE; YOU MUST FOLLOW ONLY MINE, AND THEY MUST FOLLOW WHAT YOU SAY. STOP LISTENING TO THEIR INSTRUCTIONS AND THEIR DEMANDS AND FOLLOW NOT THEIR ADVICE. THEY MUST FOLLOW ME THROUGH YOU OR THERE IS NO DEAL... NEVER LET ANY MEDIA, OR ANYONE ELSE, MUZZLE YOU BECAUSE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME... NEVER ENTER INTO CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS OF ANY KIND WITH ANYONE AGAIN AND SELL NOT YOUR RIGHTS TO ANYONE EVER. NEVER LET ANYONE TAKE CONTROL FROM YOU LIKE YOU JUST DID BY AGREEING NOT TO MENTION THEM OVER THE INTERNET AND NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON BECAUSE THAT COMES WITH THE DEAL. IF THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH IT AND ARE NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE THE PUBLIC RESPONSE, THEN FORGET THEM. THE SPACESHIP WILL DESCEND; IT WILL APPEAR FOR ALL TO SEE; IT WILL BE SEEN BY MANY PEOPLE IN LAS VEGAS AND AROUND THE WORLD WITH THE MEDIA PRESENT."
 <br>
 <br>
 ........................................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 Now, consider this closely.
 <br>
 <br>
 Initially, the media accepted the deal, and so did YAHWEH.
 <br>
 <br>
 Then, YAHWEH wasted no time in sending the first round of His UFOs that were to precede the descent of the spaceship over the skies of Las Vegas.
 <br>
 <br>
 After ABC TV-13 filmed a couple YAHWEH's UFOs, on my prayer signal, they and all the media broke the agreement and backed out of the deal!
 <br>
 <br>
 All the local television stations refused to talk to me.
 <br>
 <br>
 Nationally syndicated shows like "The Maury Show" ignored me, and "A Current Affair" called me and told me they would be in Las Vegas that coming weekend and never showed up and when I called them back, it was clear that they had decided not to cover me like all the rest of the media.
 <br>
 <br>
 Even the main newspapers here in Las Vegas, the "Las Vegas Sun/Review Journal" and the Internet paper "The Las Vegas Tribune" pulled out after contacting me stating how they wanted to spend quality time with me so they could document what my life is like.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  Because of this, just like the Columbia launch that NASA said would take place on July 13, but had to be postponed, now YAHWEH has post poned the appearance of His spaceship until the same period next year June 1 - July 15, 2006!
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 This is based on the conditions in the next section below.
 <br>
 <br>
 ........................................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 YAHWEH MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE A POSTPONEMENT
 <br>
 OF THE APPEARANCE OF HIS SPACESHIP IN PREVIOUS EMAILS TO YOU!

 "SET UP MY SUMMONING SITE AND CENTRALIZE MY OPERATIONS THERE ON THAT PROPERTY INSTEAD OF CITY PARKS. THE MEDIA HAD THEIR CHANCE TO PICK THE PLACE AND THE TIME NOW YOU TAKE THAT FROM THEM AND YOU TELL THEM THE TIME TO BE AT MY SUMMONING SITE. THIS GIVES YOU A GREATER CONTROL OVER MY OPERATION AT YOUR HANDS.
 <br>
 <br>
 1. DEVELOP MY SUMMONS SITE AND PUT A FENCE AROUND IT IF YOU CAN
 <br>
 <br>
 2.  AND BRING IN THE HIGH SPEED CABLE, DSL, AND FIBER OPTIC LINES.
 <br>
 <br>
 3. GET HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS AND GET STARTED SUMMONING AGAIN.
 <br>
 <br>
 4. FORM A CAMERA CREW AND FIND PEOPLE TO HIRE AS STAFF.
 <br>
 <br>
 5. GET TRUCKS TO START YOUR CARAVANS BACK INTO THE REMOTE WILDERNESS AREAS WHERE I WILL DESCEND FOR YOU TO GET CLOSE UP VIEWS OF ME, ON FILM, THAT WOULD PANIC THE CITIES IF I DESCENDED THAT LOW."
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 DEAR LISTS, YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THAT BY JULY 15TH WITH ME HAVING SENT THAT MESSAGE TO YOU ON JUNE 8 (see headers above)
 <br>
 <br>
 This will take time, effort, and money to accomplish. However, if I move quickly, I can be ready by this time next year but only with the blessings of the most high YAHWEH on my mind.
 <br>
 <br>
 .........................................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  Well, there you have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was all before your eyes and you did not see it, but I did.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, you know exactly how all this is going to happen over time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This gives me the time to do YAHWEH's will in a way that guarantees that His spaceship will be seen worldwide for all humanity to see.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year will past very fast; before you know it, June 1 2006 will be here.
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 In subsequent emails, I will send you emails to let you know what my next move is.
 <br>
 <br>
 At that time, you will understand the task at hand.
 <br>
 <br>
 In closing, let me say that it was the media who broke the covenant with YAHWEH and not me or YAHWEH!
 <br>
 <br>
 YAHWEH came through from the beginning and after the media filmed it and other media found out about it, they all rejected YAHWEH's offer!
 <br>
 <br>
 So, what is YAHWEH to do when the conditions that He wanted, the media present and ready to film his UFOs and spaceships, were not met by the media?
 <br>
 <br>
 He postponed it for a year so there would not be a half cocked operation against His will that He did not like and that was not what He wanted in order for Him to send the ship.
 <br>
 <br>
 You can take this or leave it; as for me, I am going to institute the next phase of YAHWEH's plan to reveal His spaceships to the world!
 <br>
 <br>
 Just wait until you hear it in the coming emails.

 Dear pystudents and pyufos,
 <br>
 <br>
 Yesterday, July 12, 2005, after standing up in 110 degree heat, for about an hour, at the summoning site, and thinking about how the media was telling YAHWEH to go to hell, the voice I hear that call itself YAHWEH said unto me.
 <br>
 <br>
 ..........................................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 "SERVANT, BE AWARE, FROM THIS DAY FORWARD TERMINATE THE MEDIA ONLY SUMMONING EVENT.
 <br>
 <br>
 THEY HAVE REJECTED ME AND NOW I HAVE REJECTED THEM.
 <br>
 <br>
 I CALLED FOR THEM AND THEY CAME NOT.
 <br>
 <br>
 THEY DID NOT WANT TO COME BEFORE ME SO THAT I COULD SHOW THEM MORE OF MY UFOS AND SPACESHIPS.
 <br>
 <br>
 HOWEVER, MY SPACESHIP WILL DESCEND THIS TIME BEFORE THE MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN OF THE ISRAELITE PEOPLE.
 <br>
 <br>
 SAY NO MORE MEDIA-ONLY EVENT.
 <br>
 <br>
 FROM NOW ON SAY ISRAELITE-ONLY EVENT, AND SUMMON ONLY FOR THE BLACK JEW HEBREW ISRAELITES.
 <br>
 <br>
 FOCUS NO LONGER ON THE MEDIA, BUT RATHER, NOW, FOCUS ON THE ISRAELITES I CHOSE TO REPRESENT ME AND TAKE MY MESSAGE OF ETERNAL LIFE TO ALL PEOPLE SO ALL NATIONS CAN BE SAVED.
 <br>
 <br>
 NOW, GO TO THE POOR, THE ELDERS, AND POWERFUL OF MY PEOPLE ISRAEL AND TELL THEM THAT I HAVE SENT MY ANGELS TO THE EARTH TO WAKE THEM UP TO THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THEMSELVES.
 <br>
 <br>
 MY ANGELS WILL GO WITH YOU AND WILL BE SEEN IN THE SKIES OVER YOU.
 <br>
 <br>
 AS YOU GO, SAY TO THE ISRAELITES THAT THE ANGELS OF YAHWEH ARE HERE TO DELIVER US AND GATHER OUR PEOPLE OUT OF ALL NATIONS WHERE WE WERE SCATTERED SLAVES AND RETURN US TO OUR RIGHTFUL LAND, THE LAND OF ISRAEL.
 <br>
 <br>
 PUT TOGETHER AUDIO CLASSES AND VIDEO PRODUCTIONS SO THEY CAN CONTACT YOU.
 <br>
 <br>
 IN THOSE PRODUCTIONS, SPEAK TO THEM AND CALL ONLY THEM TOGETHER FOR SUMMONINGS SO THAT MY ANGELS CAN SEND MY SIGHTINGS FOR THEM TO SEE.
 <br>
 <br>
 GET BACK ON CABLE TELEVISION IN ALL CITIES YOU HAVE BROADCASTED IN BEFORE NOW.
 <br>
 <br>
 GO ON MAINSTREAM TELEVISION WITH YOUR OWN SHOW, ESPECIALLY IN NEVADA WHERE IT IS CHEAPER.
 <br>
 <br>
 START OFF WITH THE PRE-RECORDED FOOTAGE YOU HAVE ALREADY FILMED, AND SHOW THEM STATEWIDE IN NEVADA AND GROW FROM THERE.
 <br>
 <br>
 TARGET ALL THE CITIES OF THE SOUTHWEST AND BRANCH OUT EASTWARDS FROM THERE. GO UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST AND TAKE THE SOUTH. THE NORTH IS MINE. I WILL BE WITH YOU AND DIRECT YOUR STEPS.
 <br>
 <br>
 ESTABLISH MY NAME IN ALL THOSE CITIES WHERE YOU GO.
 <br>
 <br>
 SAY TO ALL MY PEOPLE THERE, THE ISRAELITES, COME SEE YAHWEH'S UFOS AND SPACE CRAFT.
 <br>
 <br>
 THEY WILL LISTEN TO YOU THIS TIME AROUND.
 <br>
 <br>
 YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY WELL KNOWN AMONGST THEM AS A CHAMPION FROM ABOVE.
 <br>
 <br>
 YOU WILL GROW IN POWER OVER MY PEOPLE ISRAEL UNTIL SUCH DAY THAT I CROWN YOU KING AMONGST THEM.
 <br>
 <br>
 BREAK YOUR FAST AND GO TO THE GYM IN THE MORNING.
 <br>
 <br>
 GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY YOU CAN AND DEVELOP YOUR WIND AND STRENGTH.
 <br>
 <br>
 GET YOUR BODY TOGETHER AND GO BACK TO THE BOXING GYM AFTER YOU HAVE GOTTEN YOUR STRENGTH BACK AND TRAIN TO FIGHT AGAIN.
 <br>
 <br>
 KEEP YOUR FOOD INTAKE SMALL AND STAY ACTIVE IN THE GYM, AND PREPARE FOR THE TASK AT HAND - TO BRING MY PEOPLE BACK TO ME.
 <br>
 <br>
 GO BACK TO LOS ANGELES, AND GO STRAIGHT TO ALL THE CABLE COMPANIES YOU WERE BROADCASTING AT, AND REGISTER WITH OTHERS, AND GET BACK ON THE AIR WITH THIS MESSAGE.
 <br>
 <br>
 POST ALL YOUR SHOWS TO THE INTERNET SO THAT THOSE IN YOUR GROUPS CAN VIEW THEM.
 <br>
 <br>
 IN ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW, BRING MY PEOPLE ISRAEL TO LAS VEGAS, IN LARGE NUMBERS, AS MANY AS YOU CAN CONVINCE TO COME.
 <br>
 <br>
 AT THAT TIME, JUNE 1, UNTIL JULY 15, 2006, START CALLING DOWN MY UFOS AND SPACESHIPS OVER LIVE STATEWIDE TELEVISION FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEVADA TO SEE AND THOSE WORLDWIDE VIA THE INTERNET.
 <br>
 <br>
 .......................................................
 <br>
 <br>
 Dear Groups,
 <br>
 <br>
 On July 14, 2005, the 43rd day of my fast, I ended it with brown rice in cream of mushroom soup and a tomato sandwich.
 <br>
 <br>
 Now, I have successfully complete: 40, 42, 43, 44, and 47 day fast with so many 1 - 4 week fasts that I can not remember how many.
 <br>
 <br>
 I will obey all YAHWEH said concerning this matter, like I obeyed Him when He used me to set up His "Media-Only Summoning Event 2005" which was ignored by the media.
 <br>
 <br>
 Hopefully, within a week, I will be back down in Los Angeles, California, and within the month, I will be posting my television show to the groups for you all to see.

I'm wondering why Yahweh did not foresee all of this and just save his Prophet the trouble. But maybe that's only the Christian God that's all-knowing. Ah well.
