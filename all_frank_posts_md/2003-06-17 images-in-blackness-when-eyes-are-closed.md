I just noticed for the first time something that may have important implications for WILD lucid dreams, OBE's, or remote viewing, and probably other related phenominon. I'm sure others have noticed this but I wanted to find out if anyone can relate.
<br>
<br>
While I was laying down trying to get to sleep, I had mt eyes closed and was just awating sleep. I noticed the typical faint swirling, puffs of color and smokey morphing images that have no definite shape. (I always see this, nothing special, lets call them metamorphic images or MI's to make it simple.) But then as I approached sleep, just BEFORE the hypnogogic state, I somehow, adjusted my focus so that my eyes felt crossed and suddenly the MI's came into focus and formed into stable, 3-D images of objects! The blackness was suddely not 2-D like usual, but had depth!
<br>
<br>
I then snapped out of it for a while, went back into it, and had a long OBE, followed by a series of vivid lucid dreams. What was going on here? Can anyone relate to this?

I also noticed the MI. Sometime in grey, sometime in colour. But I have not notice the adjusting of focus yet. Maybe if I can slow it down and pay more attention to it.
<br>
<br>
Just last night, I have a somewhat long OBE and series of vivid lucid dream (they were many!) following that.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps someone else can explain this.
<br>
<br>
Late.

You have raised your awareness and have achieved a better balance between consciousness and sleep. Â I bet you already knew that though [

Sounds like you have a talent for this. The swirling colours and images you describe are typical of the Monroe Focus-12 state. You say it's nothing special to you. Gosh I'm feeling a tad envious, here. It generally takes me quite a bit of mental effort!

What you did was progress to the Focus-21 state. This is where you switch from perceiving events from a distance to a feeling of mentally stepping into the scene. Here you are situated in a kind of no-man's-land between the Physical realm and the Astral.
<br>
<br>
This state is characterised by what is commonly called the 3D-blackness. It has been talked about a number of times before. So you might find it interesting doing a search of some past posts.
<br>
<br>
At this point is the start of the realms where thought-equals-action. So if you can retain a high degree of mental focus you should find that if you place the intent (i.e. concentrate your thoughts on one thing) to be at some place, then you should immediately manifest there. Or you could try just floating in the blackness and see what happens.
<br>
<br>
I find it quite relaxing just floating about listening to classical music. Which might be a good mental excercise for you to practice using intent. See if you can mentally tune into some favourite music. If you haven't heard music within the Astral before you are in for a nice surprise.

Yes, like I say, I can relate only too well. I just wish I could slip into the Focus 12 state that easily.

GTP and Everyone,
<br>
<br>
Good thread. The input from people here at the Astral Pulse is very helpful.
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
Lately, it seems I'm in Focus 21, these scenes are sort of assembling in front of me and I'm there. At this point I'm just floating along (as I'm relatively new at this). From your post, what I would want to do next time, is be mentally focused, and place intent to be somewhere. I like the idea of mentally tuning in to music as placing intent practice . Thanks.
<br>
<br>
Very best,
<br>
<br>

I have no talent for "stepping into the scene" that's the part I have trouble with, but this one time, I was somehow just able to stay conscious. Thanks for all the helpful replies.

Projection is an entirely mental exercise. As such, success depends on keeping a high degree of control over your thoughts at all times. Unfortunately, at no time can you remain unfocused and still retain a high degree of clarity. If your thoughts drift... then you drift.
<br>
<br>
Within the Physical we have the luxury of being able to imagine being at some place, or immersed within some circumstance, and not have our surroundings chopping and changing to suit. Within the Astral, however, no such thing applies. But once you get to grips with that, I wouldn't say things become "easy" but it's about 80% to 90% of the initial learning curve.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
