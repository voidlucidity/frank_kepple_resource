I'm not sure if this the right topic but here it goes
<br>
<br>
Is there any expalnation for De ja vu and why it happens? Or do our minds think that we are seeing a reccuring event. I have de ja vu about a few times a month and was wondering if anybody else experiences it a lot and can make anything of it.

Hi,
<br>
it happens to me a few times a week too.I believe that subconsciously,probably more when we are sleeping,we visualise and decide our future.Some of these visualized images reappear sometimes to our conscious mind.That's my opinion.

i personally have always felt that de ja vu was just a precognition that happened when we are asleep and then it happens. but sometimes i have noticed that the de ja vu isnt always right like once saw my friend falling on wet grass at school and she was wearing a red shirt. but then the next day my friend fell on the grass and was wearing a purple shirt....but the next day after that she wore the red shirt that i saw...but i dont know if that had anything to do with anything

Yes but if somthing happened to us 6 months ago, and that exact image/event happens to us today, how is that deciding our future if the event has already happened more than once?? And why would these images reappear to our concious mind? Is it a sign to see the same event happen again?

Hi DarkApprentice,
<br>
<br>
Deja Vu can make sense if you consider a couple of possible concepts might be real:
<br>
<br>
1)Time is an element of relativity that exists "vertically" not "horizontally". That is, all events in time occur simultaneously, all events happen at once. Time is not a movement, but a field that we move through. There is only one moment, that which we experience now.
<br>
<br>
2) We exist on all levels of time, at the same time, but our waking consciousness only percieves tho one "now".
<br>
When you are in a dream state you are freed from the boundaries of experiencing just one level on that vertical plane of time. You are effectively able to look both up and down to what could be percieved as past and future.
<br>
<br>
Mostly, with the exception of a few very talented people, we are not able to fully absorb the memories of these visits to other levels of time.
<br>
What will happen though, is a bit of that memory will stick. Something will trigger that memory that sits lurking in the subconscious, and you will re-experience the same moment, remembering it as you do.
<br>
<br>
The memory could have been aquired 2 days, 6 months, or 3 years ago. It doesn't really matter when.
<br>
<br>
Please consider. [

<section>
Thanks James. This does make more sence to me now.
<br>
<br>
In the sense of time, what do you make on travel? If we can mentally go through time in certain states mentally, then  why hasn't anyone been able to go through time psychially?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
Also, have any of you had an AP or OBE where you saw yourself in the future?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
What was it like??? And is the future worst than today withc is pretty tough too do.
<br>
<br>
Finally, What do you guys make on John Titor? He claims that he traveled here on our time frame in the year 2000 and came from the year 2036 in his time??? Do you belive this at all?

<section>
Physically no, but psychics, esp. seers do so often. Its only a matter of where you're awareness is.
<br>
<br>
I've not OBE'd enough to attempt sending my consciousness to different times, but I've heard quite a few accounts of people who have. It seems to be perfectly feasable, with the only limiting factor being our own concepts of the mechanics of it.
<br>
<br>
Consider though that any look into the future is only a look into a possible future, one of many. Deja Vu, on the other hand is more like remembering a particular piece of a particular future at the same time as experiencing it again now.
<br>

<section>
I agree with James that De Ja Vu has a trigger, a physical trigger (objects, people etc).
<br>
<br>
At the exact moment I experience De Ja Vu, I could swear I experienced the event before, I am 100% certain I did. But after a few minutes I begin to forget the details of the De Ja Vu which is a problem because I can't brainstorm on it.  It's a shadow memory, its like a dream.
<br>
<br>
De Ja Vu's are probably a glimpse of something that we knew and laid dormant, but when we experienced it we remembered it. If that makes any sense to you.
<br>
<br>
I believe that De Ja Vu's become more frequent when the consciousness is developed and enhanced with abilities like OBE's etc.

<section>
For me DeJa Vu's are about AP to the future.  I remember the "dream" a lot of the time that I'm triggering on.  The interesting part for me, is there is usually some associated metaphysical activity.  Sort of like a beacon that drew me there (most often it's being overly tired from something, and my mind is wandering, usually slipping deep into a trance-like state sometime before the DeJa Vu).

<br>
Yep, I'd go along with that.
<br>
Probably happens because we're learning to expand our consciousness in these directions.

<section>
The answer is, there is no such thing as time as we know it. Time is not a linear element as Isac Newton said, some scientists in the 70's where agreed about it. It could be that some of the dèja vu's already happened somewhere, sometime. The fact is that cause time is not linear, events don't happen in a linear order. The only thing you should do is tuning yourself to the real time. So you can even predict the future because it has already happened somewhere in time.

<br>
somewhat agree with Atlantis Zeta,
<br>
<br>
The future hasn't happened yet, but I believe their is something called Divine Decree, everything that will happen is already recorded and the record is not just in paper and ink, but in a visual 3d enviornment.
