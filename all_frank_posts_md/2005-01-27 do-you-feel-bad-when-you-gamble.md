<section>
While playing poker with my friends, I've noticed a distinct pattern in my attitude toward the game and the outcome. Assuredly, I win when I do not feel bad about winning, and lose when I feel bad about winning. Because, invariably, I'll win and my friends will somehow feel especially sour about it... and, like the egotistic fool that I am, I think that I won because my skills were superior. The next game I will take greater risks, and lose, hoping to make them feel better. When I discovered that I felt bad winning, and obviously felt bad losing, I stopped playing poker.
<br>
<br>
Around my 21st birthday, I went to the local Indian casino to try out less competitive games like roulette and craps. The roulette table was way too busy, so I tried craps.
<br>
<br>
Craps tables are amazing. Everyone is standing up, and their minds are focused on a relatively small area. Spirits and emotions are diverse. I postulated that it was possible to look at the shooter (the one throwing the dice) and have a good idea of whether or not he would be a net winner or a net loser. Combined with conservative bets and an awareness of probability, within a couple hours, I turned $140 in $1,000. A week later, I turned $600 into $2,600.
<br>
<br>
"This isn't right," I thought.
<br>
<br>
I made riskier bets and ended up losing everything, but not before I tipped the dealers more than $360.
<br>
<br>
Now, I don't gamble at all, instead looking for bigger psychic fish (the state lottery). But I have not had the guts to follow through with doing dream research in that area, because I feel bad doing it.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone had a similar experience? Am I a deluded egotist?

I don't gamble or play the lottery.   Quite some time ago I had several dreams in a row that were blantantly showing me numbers.  Well, my hubby now plays those numbers every week....grrr..I tell him to stop wasting our money, but he keeps saying...but what if we win?
<br>
<br>
We won't, I keep telling him....another one of those "told you so moments"

Funny thing though, I can't remember those numbers to save my life, but he can pull them right out of the air.  Interesting what he thinks is important to remember and what I think..
<br>
<br>
And yeah, yeah, you can bet your bottom dollar IF we do win, I'll spend it too..

I

poker.  I only feel bad when I play badly.  If I play well and lose, so be it.  Then again, I love most games.  I love Snakes and Ladders, for goodness sake.
<br>
<br>
Bad beats are pretty tough, but if you've played well, you can go home happy.
<br>
<br>
Which one did you play?  I play No Limit Hold'em.  I play for very tiny stakes online.  In fact, I've got bored of it recently, to be honest.  I once played in a casino - it was the bravest thing I did last year - all those smoky gambling men and little old me.  Scary.

Frank, no need to worry. This creating reality stuff is too important to be taken lightly.

Nay, you should tell your husband to hold off and wait until these numbers actually come up a winner. Assure him that if you can use your dreams to win the lottery once, you can do it again.

I'm a old school gamer who plays pencil and paper style role playing games (Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Vampire, etc..) and table top battles (Warhammer FB and 40K). Anyway, lots of dice are rolled in both types of games and I usually roll pretty well. In fact some of my friends would rather I roll their dice during a battle because I roll so well.
<img alt=":twisted:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/evil.png" title="evil"/>
I tell them I'm mentally controlling my dice telekineticly. The funny thing is when ever I ACTUALLY concentrate on the dice I roll worse.
<br>
<br>
If I clear my mind before I cast the dice I do immensely better. Actually knowing how to play the games helps too but dice ARE my friend.
<br>
<br>
I haven't tried craps yet because there's a million rules but the Roulette Wheel I consider a 60ish sided dice. If I clear my head before betting and play the odds -- columns AND rows together -- I make money. If I get greedy and sit at the table too long I start to think about where to bet too much and lose money so I have to get up, cash out and come back later after I hit a big one. I suggest trying that for the wheel...

I figure, once people accept "paranormal" as "normal" gambling will go away. Or casinos will have big "NO Psychics Allowed!" signs.

I learned chess. My hubby at the time was anxious for me to exercise my skills at the local chess club. I started out against a young rated player. I began with a strong opening, he wasn't expecting this from a beginner. Once I discovered I was winning (at the cost of the opponent's ego) I weakened under the pressure of the opponent's desparation to win (to save face). A bad feeling of fright came over me. I didn't want to lose, but why was I afraid? I no longer could use tunnel vision and my confidence was shot. The game ended in a draw (oops, stale mate). A relief for me and the expert player (who didn't want to lose to a novice).  It all happened so fast!
<br>
<br>
Beginner's luck, that's me.
<br>
<br>
The first time for me, I won 49 dollars after dropping a dollar on the chance. My reasoning for doing it was silly, it was March 1? And I still haven't used up all my 49 other chances yet.
<br>
<br>
Telos, sorry but your winnings don't seem that unusually high considering what you gambled. 1 : 10 odds seems commonplace, or am I mistaken?

I bet with very small amounts ($10 - $25, mostly), and I played with an experimental mindset, judging how certain emotions and observations relate to certain outcomes, and how the apparent mindsets of others relate to their rolls. It's about as precise as the science of economics, to be honest.

It seems so, yes. Dealers, like others in the service industry, have relatively low wage jobs. At the craps table, it's common to make "two way" bets. If they win, half the winnings go to you, and half to the dealers. It's supposed to spread around good karma and raise everyone's spirits.

Yes, I was wondering if you were gathering info. As one who lives in syncrony (or awareness), I notice losses and gains in day to day living. I haven't been able to figure out a pattern, or even a way to keep track by recording, mainly because real life moves so fast. But I do notice a parallel of daily life and gambling. It's just there is no rhyme or reason to the notion of gambling. Sometimes I think it has to do with most people being out of synch with their environment. So, instead of being in denial, I stay interested in all aspects of society.
<br>
<br>
I staked out a casino once. Some friends invited me along. It was mainly a sight seeing tour. One of my friends gave me 10 dollars worth of tokens to play. I lost it all. I played another 10 dollars of my own money, lost it all. I wasn't as interested in winning as much as getting a feel for the place. I called that an entertainment expense.
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
It would seem the longer your there the more apt you are to lose.
<br>
I have a few friends who gamble. There is a secret aspect to this for some it seems. The addictive part of it perhaps?

I hear of people winning. How often do people talk of their losses? There is a fever that hits them!
<br>
<br>
A trend in my daily life is a gain or a loss of 10 generally. So if I ever go to a casino I'll need a plan. Even the trip there will have to be syncronistic in nature.  This may sound remote, but actually it's not. My son has family who do not know he exists in a town where a casino recently went in(synchrony link established). My son claims to have intuition for gambling, he recently went there with his friends. He won without knowing how to even play, 80 dollars! He does seem lucky that way.
<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say, there is a way to make things happen through synchroncity.

Wisp, I know you're right, even though it's difficult for me to wrap my head around it. I don't see any reason why I shouldn't go to the casino everyday, play conservatively, win a conservative amount, and then leave. Would I get banned? It's obvious that, if everyone did that, casinos would not be able to stay in business at all.

Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
By the way, the science of knowing (and controlling) the Causes which generates certain effects is the "law of karma". Occultism talks about that.
<br>
<br>
As someone said , God does not play dices (or something like that) , ...well the ego wants to gambling, the Initiate (who has knowledge on the Real sciences) is a being of Cause, not of effect.

<section>
daidaluz, in the case of craps, you're absolutely right. It's always a
<i>
 person
</i>
who rolls the dice. I'm not convinced that there are not very subtle unconscious motor skills affecting an outcome.
<br>
<br>
I once had a very "athletic" lucid dream where I was playing around in a store and knocked over a display of about 200 hundred shampoo bottles. I noticed how each bottle bounced and hit the floor with the same physical precision as I would expect in the real world. I thought, "if my brain is capable of calculating such an intricate series of reactions at this level, who knows what it's capable of?"

First, I must tell you of a dream last night. Within a dream I was having (can't remember the dream) a clear voice said, "Play the Powerball".Funny and surprising for me.

There is not a thing wrong with recreational fun. By the banned statement, are you wondering about ethics,law,karma, casino rules and regulations?
<br>
<br>
These questions are something to consider. Especially in how they might effect you. Testing the boundaries might be a good start. If your sensitive to instant karma, you'll know how far you can safely go.Remember too, the casino may be perfectly okay with your techniques.
<br>
<br>
From my standpoint, my reminders of boundaries are friendly and in good fun. My son's however are just the opposite. No friendly reminders, their rather severe. So I guess it depends who you are in the universe.
<br>
<br>
I have to be careful in how and when I help my son because of his stricter limits. But too, he doesn't follow universal law very well either.
<br>
Example: One time my son was put in jail for no apparent reason. Now I understand more now than then. Back then I was appalled that he could go to jail for no reason (politics). I was trying to visit him in jail. They said someone was visiting him already. It was 6:30 in the morning and no one he knows gets up that early. I felt a sense of parnoia that something had happened to him. In my anger and frustraion, I thought,"I should break him out of here!". Almost instantly a guard came out to the lobby. He placed himself right next to me. Too close to be social distance. No one else was in this room. After a few minutes of discomfort, the guard explained he is taking his break. It didn't seem right, I felt like I was under guard. The door to the lobby was open. I saw a strong wind blowing eastward. Within the wind I placed a prayer for God to help me. Well, I felt a sense of peace. I went back to the window. A new face behind the thick glass had just come on duty. I told her about the possible mistake the other person had made about my son. She checked, sure enough, they had made a mistake. I was my son's only visitor. My visit was short, and when it was time to leave, I think they kept me locked in a little longer than they should have. It was as if they were trying to teach me a lesson. The whole thing didn't set well with me. Since then, I've looked closer at both sides of issues.

<section>
That of looking closer at both sides of issues makes me think on gambling chances to win.  There are always two main forces interacting ( the chance to win , and the chance to loose) , the best way to learn controlling this forces is by learning to play poker (see interactions between players).
<br>
Now , to be able to controlling other games as roulette for example, we must be able to recognize this same forces but in a more subtle way. In every game you'll find this same two forces into play, but are hidden into levels of subtleness.    ... Lets say that to recognize them  we need to learn to astral project into this subtle "levels" and see them on action.

Hey, Telos!
<br>
I hope this won't turn into a bad joke.
<br>
Yesterday I was with some friend in a neighbor town and we were playing some music and have fun and, when we started meditating, a few thoughts were occurring to me and I couldn't get them of of my head. It was mainly that I was number 397 in a group of people and you were number 74. I don't know what this mean, or if it makes any sense to you. I hope it's not puzzling.
<br>
Now, it's up to you at which level you want to understand these numbers. Still, I guess it will be a lesson for me, too, if I'm telling you about it.
<br>
Enjoy it, anyway!

I don't feel bad when I gamble, but I hardly win, either. I consider the money spent "entertainment money". I could have spent it going to the movies or seeing a concert.
<br>
<br>
I've been trying to use remote viewing to predict Keno numbers, but I haven't had much luck. Considering it has the worst odds in the casino (according to a show on the Travel Channel), I figured I'd use my intuitiveness to my advantage. I don't have much experience in RVing, but I've done some experiments which I've had some OK luck with.
<br>
<br>
I usually spend $2 and get back anywhere from $.50 to $1.50 (the local casino has a deal where you can play the same numbers for 4 games in a row for only $.50 a game). Sometimes, I walk away with nothing, but usually I get $.50 or $1.00. Ironically, I actually get those payouts from having 0 or 1 numbers sometimes (That actually pays out if you play 15 numbers, like I do).

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Far be it from me to want to put a spoke in the works, but I think gambling is not right, in the wider sense. Because it discounts yourself, and that's why I, personally, never engage in it. It implies that "reality" can come about "by chance" and there is no such thing. Though Telos presents a good case (as per usual).
<br>

<br>
Frank, I agree, and this leads me to a rather delicate question I have for you.
<br>
<br>
Don't psychics (or "reality creators" in general) have a responsibility to advance truth, and dismantle the global gambling economy?
<br>
<br>
People are lax to believe in reality creation, I think, because chance is so prevalent and so pervasive. It's in the stock market news every day, it's in currency exchanges, it's in sports, and, of course, it's in gambling. It's even in scientific literature in the form of quantum mechanics.
<br>
<br>
Should we find ways of exposing chance as a false interpretation of reality?

Telos:

<br>
You present a tantalising scenario regarding the question of gambling re: the stance of the more modern-day practitioners of this art who would purport that we create our own reality (of which I am one). Suggesting that we should perhaps work towards disseminating the advancement of these traditional money-laden structures by taking the goods, so to speak, to the extent they would be no-longer be operable.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest to you, in all seriousness, there is an opening yet for the young up-and-coming practitioner of this art to potentially "clean up" money wise. But as for me, I'm more concerned with circumstances to do with the "healing" side of things, let's say. And that's what takes up my day, every day. Being broke is something you just kinda get used to. :)
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

If we consider that there is a perfect balance between the inner and the outer realities, maybe the economic circumstances are a medium for the manifestation of conscience.
<br>
<br>
One of my relatives kept of taking part to different prise contests organized by different magazines, but would never win anything. And I have always been sure that she will never win, because it does not fit  into her life lessons or understanding (as much as I understand this). It is rather a way for her to experience the miraculous at a material level, because she is not religious, rather I feel that she is repressing her spiritual tendencies. So the fate (if we consider that there is such a thing), will not let her go down into material expectation, but increase the tension in her search for noncausal (miraculous) happenings.
<br>
<br>
(I am from a country in which the communist regime repressed for years the religious or spiritual life, so the desire for miraculous very much expresses itself through such tendencies.)
<br>
<br>
The brother of this relative of mine, on the contrary, has gained many times in lottery in a short time. He has worked for years, as engineer then as a manager, in a steel factory, which has been his life. A very good professionalist and he has worked for years more than hard. After loosing his position and job, because the leadership of that factory has changed (he says that the new managers are corrupted), he didn't accept another job, is just hovering around, reading, leaving sometimes on the country side and trying to bear a horrible wife.
<br>
<br>
Now, about the numbers he has used in the lottery.
<br>
He told us that first he has tried personal numbers: birth dates of close relatives, then, seeing that this does not work, birth dates of special positive personalities. It didn't work either. Then he shifted to different devilish fellows, to see what will happen. I think he even tried with Saddam Husein, but it didn't help too much
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
.
<br>
Then he gave it up and just used numbers taken at random: in a few months he gained repeatedly! Once it was a pretty important amount of money. He was very happy to tell us about it his discovery regarding numbers taken at random.
<br>
Personally I consider that this was the lesson specially designed for him: that neither family nor the bad guys are so important, and also that one cannot control things, that rather a kind of surrender can be much productive, and also that there is an order beyond the logical, causal reality.
<br>
You see, I have tried many times to tell him that a bit of meditation will help him more than any other thing, or that the logic-materialistic education they have been given under communists is fake and restrictive. He has always told me that he knows better, that he has also read a lot of non-materialistic philosophy etc. But he could never get the experience.
<br>
He got it through these lottery games...
<br>
<br>
The funny thing for me is, that the last time he came in my town to take the money he had gained (for big amounts one has to come to the capital city), he promised that he will give me half of the money he will win the next time. This was more that a Year ago, and still nothing happened!
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
I think I have put an end to his happy ride!
<img alt=":oops:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/embarrassed.png" title="embarassed"/>

<br>
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
(Because me, too, I don't need to experience the miraculous in such experiences. My luck lies somewhere else.)
<br>
<br>
I suppose that there is something like a conversation we lead with a higher conscience, necessary for our guidance, which also manifests in such experiences. Which are, again, very personal...

Fascinating story, sweetbliss! Especially given the communist backdrop.
<br>
<br>
I'll have to think about it for a while... Like Frank, I don't like how people subject themselves to chance, but you've offered an interesting perspective.
<br>
<br>
I once read a lot of stories about lottery winners in the US and in the UK, and almost as a rule the majority are unhappy afterwards. Their relationship with their significant other ends, or their marriage ends in a divorce. And they either spend it all very quickly, or they lose all their friends for not spending it. Also, they end up going through psychological trauma, preoccupying themselves with questions like, "why did this happen to me? why not someone else, who might have deserved it more, or used it better?" That, and they find that they are not satisfied with the amount of money they received.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to see such a system destroyed, but I don't think it can happen through democratic action. People love chance. It gives them a sense of freedom from their lives, but they are not in the driver seat of that freedom. You've offered an interesting perspective on randomness... people use randomness to learn and grow. It is, as many scientists say, the driving force of evolution.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should not tamper with it, or try to "expose it as a fraud." It is a natural process, regardless of whether or not it is knowable. To win a lot of money, and afterwards evangelize about how randomness doesn't exist, continuously demonstrating it by winning more money, would tie a knot up in nature.
<br>
<br>
It would ruin C1.
<br>
<br>
Frank, what are your thoughts?

If I had faith I could win in gambling alone with proof that I could, I would abuse the heck out of it.
<br>
<br>
I don't though, because to me gambling is a scam, and I hate anyone who does it.

As a casino dealer of most games everyone should lose in the long run, as long as there is a house edge.  Contrary to casino employment rules I have tried to explain to customers that the games are not fair.  The most you can do is minimize the house edge  with the best play.  With that I have yet to meet anyone who cares.  All they want to hear is that I'm going to pay them.  I honestly wish more could win as my tips depend on winners for the most part.  People usually don't feel like tipping when they lose.  The casino pays less than minimum wage to the dealers and the rest of my earnings come from the generosity of the patrons.  For example i make 4.50 an hour plus on average 10 to 12 extra an hour based on tips that have been pooled throughout the work week.  In my humble but correct opinion
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
the casino should post somewhere the house edge of various games and wagers.  As a horribly absent minded individual Ive lost my point if any so ill leave this at that.
