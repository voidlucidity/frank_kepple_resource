i  felt the vibrations in my body last night, then all of a sudden stopped,  had i projected ??  also,  i felt like i was in my astral body, but i could still feel myself breathing,  and when you are in your astral body, do you breath, or feel your body breathing?

That's normal. Sub-conscious fear probably put a stop to it. I always say that if you have to ask the question, "Did I or did I not project?" Then, chances are, you didn't. But it sounds like you are getting *very* close.

Personally, I get no sensation of "breathing" whilst on the Astral. But that's not to say such would be the case for everybody. There's no need for any "clothing" but my body always appears to be dressed. Plus, I also wear my "watch" and "spectacles" when on the Astral.

I have also felt these vibrations and I it is the farthest that I have come so far.
<br>
I also still feel myself breathing during the vibrations and I was wondering how should I handle the vibrations should I focus on them or ignore them ?
