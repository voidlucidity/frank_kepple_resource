<section>
Let me start of with this:
<br>
<br>
I had my first OBE this January '05, (im' 16 ) and since then i've had 3 more. They have all been spontaneous.
<br>
<br>
I have tried a few times in the past to consciously induce them, and I've gotten pretty close. I tried last night and I eventually felt weightless, etc. etc.
<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS. I've noticed something that happens every time:
<br>
- Once i get further into the process, (relaxed, weightless, etc) my heart begins to beat faster, and faster and faster and its kindof distracting.
<br>
<br>
Is that somethign that happens to you guys? or am i doing something wrong? Or, is that just fine and normal? Is it cause i'm too excited or something? help me lol
<br>
<br>
*I'm not afraid, so thats not why *

You'll be relieved to hear it's perfectly normal and incredibly common.
<br>
<br>
It's not your physical heart.  It's your heart chakra.  Do a search for "heart chakra".  That should bring up a lot of information about it.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I too was going to say the same thing. There is an energy centre in the region of your chest. Mystics call it a "heart Chakra" but it has nothing to do with your physical heart. Oh, and not that Sarah is a mystic either but she's saying that just to identify it.
<br>
<br>
When this energy-centre starts getting excited you feel a sensation of a very fast heartbeat in your mind. This sensation can very easily be confused with your physical heart. In that you think your physical heart is beating at 200 beats per minute or something. So people typically get scared and that brings them out of the state.
<br>
<br>
This energy centre I fire off about once a week just for the effects it gives. If you roll with it you will find it gives some great sensations. With me I go all light, as if I am floating. It feels like my physical body has expanded to about 4 times the size and like I'm made of foam rubber. Plus there is all the energetic sensations going on at the same time. It's really whacky and great fun.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank, the effects you say you get when you fire off your heart energy center are amazingly similar to the effects i get when i try a traditional OBE. i think im doing something else then OBE

but as for the rapid heartbeat, it is very common so its nothing to worry about. it is distracting but the more it happens the more you get used to it and the less it will distract you

<br>
I get the heartbeat thing quite often and have assumed it was my physical heart.  But to be honest, I'm in hypnogogia-land when this is happening so it could be physical or non-physical, and I probably wouldn't be able to tell.  How can I tell if it's physical or not?  Thanks...
