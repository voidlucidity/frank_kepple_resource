Friends,
<br>
<br>
Pioneers of Astral Projection, they Spent All Their Lives experimenting, proving, writing and teaching. They are now lost to the ages, but would you think they would find a way to communicate back to the physical world like through other astral projectioners?

I had several "dream-like" experiences being trained by a voice identical to Monroe's.
<br>
<br>
It consisted of a series a dreams jumping in lake filled with alligators, followed by by swimming rather frantically to the shore, and then back into the lake again.
<br>
<br>
It was useful in that the fear subsided over time. Monroe's voice leading me through it was comforting.
<br>
<br>
I don't think it was Monroe (pretty certain it wasn't him), but the symbolics were pretty useful for me at the time.
<br>
<br>
To some extent it may be disconcerting that there is no communication with these people who dedicated much of their lives to OBEs.
<br>
<br>
Then again, I can't see myself being bothered with such communications after I die. Maybe the answer is as simple as that.

<section>
I don't think that I would want to face alligators as a true test of fear to overcome...
<br>
<br>
I would think the great ober's would at least want to contact someone here on earth and say all this research, study, methods are definitely real. Maybe to exercise methods that they taught and critique them to someone who projects from the physical. Even though we've projected zillions of times, there still lies that question what is it like when we die and how can we help the human race...

If someone said "I talked to Robert Monroe in the astral last night and he wanted me to tell you...", would you believe them?
<br>
<br>
Also, I was under the impression that people at the Monroe Institute are in constant contact with him. I could be wrong.
<br>
<br>
The last few Astral Pulse newsletters has had sound recordings of "direct voice" channeling. The people who invented/conducted the original seances, came to the session to describe the after-life after they had passed. (if you believe it)

You missed out Oliver Fox, Vincent Turvey, JHM Whiteman, Yram and various others I can't think of right now.  But it's good to hear from someone else who remembers these old pioneers too.  I expect they couldn't be bothered with earth-life anymore and probably find it as difficult getting "down here" as we do getting "up there".....!

In Bruce Moen's books he describes meetings with Monroe after he passed away (one was even during Monroe's funeral when Moen attended non-physically), and claims others at the institute experience similar such encounters.

Several years ago when I first became interested in OBE I read a lot about it and even contacted the Monroe Institute. They sent me a whole package of articles and things to read. I don't remember exactly what I read, but something gave me this impression. Sorry for the lack of info, but I'm looking up on it now.

Catmeow,
<br>
<br>
I've read fox but the others I've not. Right now, I'm reading on bruce's material then off to a few that you suggested.
<br>
<br>
I would imagine that you are right about the pioneers that have past on. I think that there's probably some law forbidding this? Maybe God said its not your territory to intervene with physical life no more. Who knows?
<br>
<br>
But it would be interesting if the monroe institute still remained in contact with Robert. Someone said that there were audio files of this?

I briefly heard of Carlos Castaneda in my anthropology classes and he is also some kind ''marginal''  pioneer in the anthropological discipline. He was never totally accepted because of the naive materialistic scientific approach that overshadow the Western world but he still got an impact anyway, which is good. I might continue my study in the similar fashion that he did but not into ''exotic'' cultures like he did; but again, academia is really a pain in the azz and I'm not a good writer also dammit. I always thought that the anthropological discipline should do a cross-cultural analysis of the case of astral projection since it is almost a universal phenomena (we can observe it in many cultures, if not all, over the world). There is a link on Carlos and some of his work:

<section>
The works of Carlos Castenada are indeeed interesting.  I always assumed they were fiction, due to the extreme nature of the claims he made.  For instance he talks about "men of wisdom" (I think that's what he called them) and claimed that these people were able to dematerialise and rematerialise a few hundred yards away etc.  Castenada wrote many books, and I simply assumed he was onto a money-spinning, winning book formula.  The first Castenada book I read was called
<i>
 A Separate Reality
</i>
.  Whether fiction or not, his books are very well written using evocative imagery and certainly worth reading.

<section>
During my earlier years at projecting and reading Castaneda, I've been able to exercise a few techniques written.
<br>
<br>
Ex: turning myself into a bird, like a black eagle.
<br>
Ex: Viewing objects far away and bringing them closer w/o even moving to the object.
<br>
Ex: Seeing the luminous glow around people,objects, animals from the physical
<br>
<br>
Again, even though Carlos was under the apprenticeship of Don Juan, his writing reflected the western world of the Yaqui Indian sorcery. Earlier in Carlos teachings he was under heavy use of peyote which would break him from the modern day world.
<br>
<br>
I have had the opportunity to read all Castaneda's books. The best one which really stood out was 'Journey to Ixtlan' and  'The Power of Silence'.
<br>
<br>
You can obtain reading material from the following link. Looks like someone took the time and gave brief explanations of the books to read about. Enjoy..

Catmeow,
<br>
<br>
You mean that you never tried to turn yourself into something else in the astral? I've at times turned myself into a eagle, a blueberry smurf (don't ask why!), and a woman.

Think about it - if you can melt your hands, cut off your arm, or pull your upper part of your mouth out - whats the difference in changing your appearance?

Hi All,
<br>
<br>
Bob Monroe is quite active in the afterlife.
<br>
<br>
I have a few of my own experiences with him. All of them only audio communication.  It started out as "Hemi-Sync radio" where he was monologuing and sending me hemi-sync sounds into my ears while I was OBE which produced strange visual experiences. It's important to note, I'm
<br>
hardly a Hemi-Syncer myself. I bought a few tapes and CD's,
<br>
but don't get much out of them. Never been to Gateway either.
<br>
<br>
In one my latest experiences with him, he was in his lab
<br>
and I asked him he could send me some PUL (pure unconditional
<br>
love) energy so that I could experience what it was like. It sounded like he was tinkering with a few buttons. Then I felt quite warm, fuzzy, and white. Not exactly an emotional epiphany. But actually helped me put 2 and 2 together regarding previous experiences.
<br>
<br>
I mentioned "Bob's lab" on another board and a person pointed
<br>
me to a recent book by Rosalind McKnight (Soul Journeys) It turns
<br>
out there's a whole chapter of Bob's lab on the other side. That
<br>
was a nice confirmation.
<br>
<br>
Bob definitely has an agenda of some type with me. I can only
<br>
conjecture what that might end up being. Channeling books?
<br>
He even gave me my own special codeword to conjure him up, which
<br>
really touched me, since I don't have a regular guide when I'm APing. He has a very matter of fact tone when talking to me. I once asked him whether I was part of his Disk (soul group) - to which he replied - "What would I need you for?"

<section>
Catmeow,
<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know what you mean about the reflection in the mirror looking younger. What really blows me away is a lot of times I will be in a dream and see braces on my teeth which I once had back in the day. I will start pulling the braces out and teeth will fall out along with pulling on the upper roof of my mouth coming out too with blood everywhere. I will then look into the mirror and can see inside of my head.. Its kinda of nasty.. Just don't know why I keep having these every so often.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I have no plans on cross dressing - just not my gig. My might wear my wife's bra and panties every now and then to get in touch with my feminint side..

That's never occurred to me... but it's a great idea, I will definitely try that....!
<br>
<br>
Regarding the braces and the blood and stuff, we all have issues which we carry with us for years and don't realise, like I still have nightmares about taking my exams at school and I haven't revised anything.....  It's amazing how long these things stay with us....  In these dreams I sometimes just say, "well stuff the lot of you" and walk out.  It's very empowering...

<section>
Tvos,
<br>
<br>
The very first time I bumped into him was when I visited TMI-there,
<br>
which is the high-astral version of the Monroe Institute. Apparently,
<br>
he keeps an eye on the activities going on there with one of his
<br>
many selves. I introduced myself and started pouring on the flattery
<br>
and he acted like I was bothering him.
<br>
<br>
From then on, my encounters have been audio only. One night,
<br>
I was just minding  my own business while AP'ing around and I seemed to pick up a radio station with RAM's voice. He was going into a whole dissertation about "double bodies".
<br>
<br>
Then, a few months later, I heard his voice again talking about some esoteric subject. I asked a question and amazingly he answered. I proceeded to ask several questions. He then gave me a codeword to
<br>
reach him should I have more questions.
<br>
<br>
From what I can gather in my experiences, he would like to teach knowledge about the afterlife to anyone who would like to listen, hence the radio effect. So far I've had difficulty remembering what he says. As you know it can be hard to process technical information while AP'ing.

<br>
Sounds very interesting and actually shines hope that he's in contact - very cool indeed.
<br>
<br>
Btw: You said that you picked up a radio station with RAM's voice. Was this in the astral or physical?  Are you in the astral world at the time, meditation, trance, channeling? What level of the astral or higher would you say that you've reached him at? Also, have you used the codeword to verify?
<br>
<br>
Please advise and keep up the great work!!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
A few people asked me about possibly contacting Monroe recently, which sparked my interest again. I have come across what looks to me like Monroe a number of times, but I still have not been able to prove that to myself yet so I tend to refrain from commenting.
<br>
<br>
I never managed to find the supposed TMI-There either. Anyhow, I've been giving it a go the past couple of mornings and this morning I made contact with a person again who, to all intents and purposes looked, sounded and spoke like Monroe. We chatted for about half an hour (as it felt like there). We were outside a light-coloured stone building, which I am assuming was his "house". We were sitting talking about his work mainly and I was telling him about the developments that were taking place here. He appeared interested and delighted about particular aspects.
<br>
<br>
He confirmed to me the importance of the focus 3 state and the need to achieve a deep focus 10 in order to set the process rolling. He confirmed that he created the focus model as a teaching aid and he did not use it himself as he was beyond using it.
<br>
<br>
I asked him about more technical aspects regarding Focus 4 of my model and explained about my problems in going "beyond" focus 27, which I won't go into here as it's all just my technical research stuff and irrelevant to the thread. But one interesting thing he stated that his focus 34/35 is in the physical (i.e. the wider physical or what mystics would term the RTZ) which was interesting.
<br>
<br>
In all, though, I did not manage to get any kind of infomation that I could use to objectively check whether this person was who he said he was. The energies can translate in all manner of ways and it is a minefield for the unwary and for those who enjoy jumping to conclusions.
<br>
<br>
I'll be trying again and perhaps next time talk about more general matters, to see if I can get some snippets of info I can perhaps check with people at TMI for authenticity. Whoever it was I can definitely say was resident within the upper branches of Primary Focus 3 of my model. In other words, I am 100% certain it was not my own construct. But as to whether it was actually Monroe, I cannot say.
<br>

<section>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
Question - what about the other authors we've read their books. Have you ever ran across the following?
<br>
<br>
Sylvan Muldoon
<br>
Carlos Castaneda
<br>
C.W. Leadbeater
<br>
Scott Rogo
<br>
Helena P. Blavatsky
<br>
<br>
Its good to hear that people are making contact with Robert Monroe and that he's definitely alive and communicating back to the public.
<br>
<br>
My question is since Monroe is now separated from his physical body and has past on, wouldn't in theory mean that there's that separation then these different levels of focus 1,2,3 etc? I still find it hard to understand that there's no separation during a obe. I've studied Monroe for awhile (long time ago) and many others.  To me, once there's detachment after death - what else could there be? The spirit/soul exists outside the physical body.
<br>
<br>
Your thoughts are welcomed.
<br>

 I asked him about more technical aspects regarding Focus 4 of my model and explained about my problems in going "beyond" focus 27, which I won't go into here as it's all just my technical research stuff and irrelevant to the thread. But one interesting thing he stated that his focus 34/35 is in the physical (i.e. the wider physical or what mystics would term the RTZ) which was interesting.

<br>
So is he saying that you go in a loop or you enter some "trans dimensional" area of the physical of some sort? Thats very interesting.

<section>
MT:
<br>
<br>
I agree, very interesting.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the original model, it would be assumed that a focus state higher than focus 27 would be "further out" in terms of an area of mental focus. But it would appear that everything just becomes muddled with this focus 34/35 concept that I always said just didn't add up. Well, not for me at any rate as it simply did not concur with my experience.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, there is nothing "beyond" focus 27 in the sense of the continuation of a series of objectively oriented focus states that are in some way more profound or meaningful, let's say, than focus 27. Focus 27 is on the "edge" of that area in consciousness that "begins" at focus 23. It was my attempts to go "beyond" focus 27 that led me to formulating the view that the structure of consciousness was laid out into what I now call Primary Areas of Focus.
<br>
<br>
As you know I'm not religious at all but the very early teachings would appear to concur with this type of structure. That is, when you cut through all the layers of religious conditioning that has been laid on them by generations.
<br>
<br>
I studied Judaism in some detail and I have had a number of AP members who have come back to me saying how they have looked at other basic teachings. Now they know what to look for, they've been digging through all the mystical and religious conditioning that has been heaped on them over hundreds of generations and, sure enough, in the midst of all the flowery lingo many basic teachings from several sources appear to be talking of this 4-area structure of consciousness as well.
<br>
<br>
On the surface, then, it would appear that the whole religious "thing" that all these generations have been getting off on the past 2000 years or so, has been a mere distraction, a tangent to nowhere you could say.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, getting back to the f34/f35 thing, it would seem this is not a focus state "beyond" focus 27 at all. But the label attached to a particular focus within the wider physical. Ha ha, no wonder I couldn't find it. But it still sounds a tad weird. All those little green men in flying saucers making meep-meep noises monitoring Earth changes. It all sounds more than a little far-fetched to me. But now I know where in the structure of consciousness this focus state is meant to be, I suppose I now have a better chance of checking it out.
<br>
<br>
The interesting aspect about his, for me, is to do with my investigation into the workings of these Trans-Dimensional areas in consciousness. There are many, many other physical worlds (could be an infinite number) and the weird thing is they all occupy the same physical space. The actual characteristics of the different dimensions can be wildly different but they all have this one thing in common, in that they occupy the same space. Anyhow, what "separates" them, if you like, are these Trans-Dimensional areas in consciousness that allows each physical universe to overlay on one another.
<br>
<br>
Now, I have it on good authority that it IS possible to "travel" between Trans-Dimensional areas. When I say travel I mean actual physical travel. It is also possible to do this non-physically as well I am told. So my theory is that these UFO sightings are, in fact, a kind of "bleed through" from another Trans-Dimensional area. An area that has people living within it who have already learnt how to design some kind of craft with the ability to travel between physical dimensions.
<br>
<br>
I also feel I am on the verge of solving the mystery surrounding the mystical notions of reincarnation, and this is wrapped up in the above I feel.
<br>
<br>
There is something about linear time that just doesn't add-up to me, there's something freaky about it that I cannot yet explain. So many times I have felt on the verge of a major realisation about it, but it won't come through into my area of objective knowing. I can experience it, as a concept, within Primary Focus 4 of consciousness, but I cannot bring it into my area of Primary Focus 2. Linear time could well be completely mind created and every aspect of our lives could actually be occurring at the same point in time. Plus, I'm getting to the stage where I'm becoming convinced that each person exists in his or her very own dimension of existence.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, it's all early days yet but it is an exciting prospect (or it is for me at least) that the realisation or the knowing of how these Trans-Dimensional areas function, could hold the key to the eventual development of some kind of interdimensional craft. Not that I am saying that I personally could ever build one (perchance to dream!) but even to just get the theory down on paper would be a major step forwards.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank -
<br>
<br>
What about evolution? Do you think that focuses of consciousness change. Perhaps as more humans progress through the focuses, new focuses become available, or others evolve?
<br>
<br>
Rudolph Steiner spoke a lot about a consciousness that can be found in the RTZ, which he says is the center point of "spiritual" evolution. He also said that it didn't come into the RTZ until the late 19th century, but events here and in the astral have lead up it. Could this be a part of focus 34/35?
<br>
<br>
Last thing - If travel through transdimentional areas is true, would that mean a ship could leave from one place here, go into a transdimensional area, and comeback somewhere else here, ie. teleportation. That's one sci-fi theory that could work.
<br>
<br>
(These are ideas and concepts that are over my head. I apologize if it appears I don't know what I'm talking about, or have gotten off topic).

<section>
Tvos,
<br>
<br>
I hear Monroe and his "radio" when I'm in the astral state but I'm connected to  my body. This is during the time I'm lucid when I'm sleeping at night. Lucid dreaming is my std. technique for starting exploration.
<br>
From what I've read in McKnight's book, RAM dwells in the "love plane"
<br>
I think this is also the mental plane, right above the astral. The fact that
<br>
I only hear his voice means, my state is of a lower vibration, but he manages to connect with me (using his technology?).  Note how Frank can see him also. I'm still working on reaching the mental plane regularly.
<br>
I should work with Frank to see if we are communicating with the same person, if Frank can glean my codeword or some other piece of info or vice-versa. Note how we can't verify it's Monroe we're talking to, unless RAM provided us some form of info that we could verify with his family or close friend.

How often do you project and when you do are you able to tune into this frequency with RM all the time or by trial and error? I appreciate the info. and this would be great to see if Frank receives the same contact info from RM.

<section>
Tvos,
<br>
Thanks for letting me brag about myself
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
In a good week, I can project as much as 4 days out of the week. On a bad one, I might be able to muster a weekend trip sleeping in. I find the secret to lucidity for me is intention, energy work, not being stressed out in life, and getting plenty of sleep (low to zero sleep debt) Getting in touch with RAM has been a challenge, it wasn't intentional when it first happened. I've only done it now about 3 or 4 times, 2 of them intentional. The unintentional visits were stronger/longer. The codeword doesn't always work. My mental state seems to be more important. He commented once, sorry I can't speak to you, your energy isn't ready.
<br>
I think getting more visits with Monroe will require conscious mental plane projection. How do I do that? I'm not an expert, I'm just beginning to break the barrier. Let's see - pure thoughts, desire/request to merge with Higher Self, intention to raise vibrations or raise the "heat" kind of like revving up your energies, intending to switch to my mental body. I've gathered from other people, mental projection is somehow projection from a different chakra or point of the body. I don't have a sense, though, where I'm projecting from because when I  become lucid, I'm already "out" or least my focus is in the etheric body (seeing thru closed eyelids)
<br>
Maybe Frank can give us some tips on mental projecting. It's definitely the next challenge for me. Maybe they should start a new sub-forum on mental projection - the world of guides,HS,love,etc.

<section>
Mendel,
<br>
<br>
I checked our your web site and am very impressed. You definitely got your s&amp;^t together and are organized. I appreciate you sharing the info. with me and the AP members about RM. Sounds like you are DEFINITELY onto something so keep pushing at it.
<br>
<br>
I like when people brag about themselves because ya learn a lot and it also makes one think (me) how much I brag and could be a little lesser. But anyways, nothing like self indulgence ehh!
<br>
<br>
Couldn't ever imagine how to even describe a mental projection or go about it. That would be a total different change from the everyday norm of a astral projection! I've been searching for awhile now to learn how to reach the higher planes and I do thinks its all in the energy and vibrations.
<br>
<br>
That is very good you can get out 3-4times a week. I was like that when I started back in 1988, but almost projected everyday 3-4yrs solid. It got very tiring, mental, physical, writing the journals blah blah. Took a lot of time from the physical and burned me out, but still had the projections through out the years here and there. Well, I'm fully rested now and my experiences have been incredible. I just recently did my first card experiment and yielded excellent verification. I will probably post the whole experience in the AP section. Some real beautiful elements in the experience like meeting a angel taking form as a bird, rays from the sun beaming down to me, talking to my scottish terrier "Leroy" and of course talking to the deceased....
<br>
<br>
Lets keep in touch!!

<section>
Hello everyone
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
This happened to me just this very morning and I'm grinning all over my face about it.
<br>
<br>
By the way, Ted is a dog!
<br>
____________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 I woke up at 7.45am and went for a wee.  Back to bed and did the noticing exercise.  Got tired so turned onto my side and fell asleep.
 <br>
 <br>
 A bit later I was dreaming (but nearly awake) and I had Ted sleeping with me.  I had my arm over his and we were sleeping together.  I wanted to have an experience, because I haven't had one in the new place yet.  I was semi-awake but mostly asleep.  I placed an intent to have an experience and then thought there was no harm in asking Robert Monroe for his assistance.  So I mentally called to him and asked him if he'd help me get out.
 <br>
 <br>
 Good old Robert!  I felt myself moving away from my sleeping physical body.  Rather than being in my own place, I realised I was in a house, unfamiliar to me.  I walked around for a while and then mentally decided that I wanted to go and visit a friend in another country.  I asked Monroe to help me get there.  Someone else was in the room and they said, "
 <i>
  Who's Robert Monroe
 </i>
 ?" so I started explaining about him, which I knew would keep me lucid and "with it".  Then I looked out of the window and noticed the house was moving, on its way to my friend.  However, it was moving along about the speed of a boat and I thought to myself "
 <i>
  hmmm, this could take a long time
 </i>
 ."  There was some kind of banister/staircase contraption in front of me, so I put one leg either side of the bottom banister and held onto the handrail, in the hope that feeling the solid wood would keep me in the experience.  I continued to look out of the window and could still see land, so I knew we hadn't left England yet.  Then I thought, "
 <i>
  I hope I don't lose this before I get there
 </i>
 ."
 <br>
 <br>
 What a silly thing to think because I lost it as soon as I thought that.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, I was back in the dream with Ted sleeping next to me.  I cursed myself and remembered that Monroe had said in his books that if you want to visit someone, you merely have to think of them/their personality and you'd be there.  So, I mentally said, "
 <i>
  I'd love a second chance, Robert, please let me try one more time, I know what to do now
 </i>
 ."
 <br>
 <br>
 And ta-da!  I rose from my physical and off I went again.  I think it was the same house.  I appeared to be on the first floor.  Just as I was about to think of my friend, I looked out of the window and I saw two men on the pavement outside.  The man in front was looking up at me.  He had a grey suit on, grey short curly hair and a grey moustache.  He had no expression on his face at first.  Instantly, I felt it was Monroe.  It looked like Monroe (certainly like the picture I've seen of him), only a lot older.  He looked very business-like.  I started smiling and mouthed to him, "
 <i>
  Thank you Monroe
 </i>
 " and he smiled back as the house started moving again.  His smile was warm and genuine.  I continued watching him, all thoughts of visiting my friend gone.
 <br>
 <br>
 Then I looked away, and was far too excited to remember anything else.  I just kept thinking to myself, "
 <i>
  That was Monroe!  You've just seen Monroe
 </i>
 " whereupon with all the excitement, I promptly woke up.
</span>

Very cool indeed - its those experiences that last a life time. Too bad you couldn't take a Polaroid picture of you with Monroe and bring it back!
<br>
<br>
It appears that Robert is still active and communicating with fellow projectors and that is great to see!
<br>
<br>
Maybe the house that you were in was a houseboat of some sort? Will you able to get a good detailed description?

Sadly, I must admit to not being a very observant person, either in non-physical or physical.  I only see what's in front of my nose most of the time, which means I miss loads of stuff.

Hi Mike
<br>
<br>
I sure hope he does pay me a visit again.
<br>
<br>
What is especially nice about it all is that before yesterday when I asked for Robert's assistance, I'd been going through a dry spell, where for about a month or so nothing had happened to me.
<br>
<br>
However, even this morning I managed to sway from my lying position to the other side of the bed and open my eyes.  And today I was totally awake.  That was all I could manage, mind you, but after a dry spell, it's enough to know you've still "got it"!!

<br>
<br>
I know what you're talking about regarding dry spells.
<br>
<br>
It's nice to know there are different intercessors out
<br>
there who can help us back into the astral. That is, there
<br>
seems to be certain people like Monroe
<br>
who offer their services to projectors who need an extra
<br>
push. I've gotten help from other people's guides and
<br>
and two energy healer Masters - one alive/one deceased.
<br>
Someone on another board, a devout Christian, says
<br>
her archetype gives her a big boost.

<section>
Seleski,
<br>
<br>
About three months ago I really started hitting the ap's real hard. Focusing my intent, energy, feeling that excitement and working towards these experiences once again. At the most, I've had 3 weeks dry spell during these 3 months. I questioned "why" and what am I doing wrong?
<br>
<br>
I was getting a little worried until 3 days ago when I hit it big with the card experiment. What I think really helped was setting my alarm clock to go off every 1/2hr. That would force me to slip into the hypnotic state easily. When I did come back from the projection, I was able to determine that it took me 1/2hr to enter or wake up into the trance state and leave. I think by having the alarm clock set and ready to go off every half hour forced me to wake up or into the trance state.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe this will help in the future?

During the dry spell, I knew they'd come back eventually.  And I also know that I'll be projecting regularly again in the not too distant future - I can feel it in my bones!

I understand what you are talking about enjoying sleep! Its a beautiful price we pay for projecting!

Its either our beauty sleep or projection..

But you are right about sensing when a projection will occur. I just knew somewhere in the back of my mind that I would be successfull in projecting last week. I think the alarm clock added to the experience!

Selski,
<br>
<br>
The night before I tried setting my alarm to go off every 1/2hr and it didn't seem to work as effective like before. Maybe, I should try every 20mins to see if there's a better chance.
<br>
<br>
I wish that I knew why some days I can fluently project and others why even bother? There must be something within the physical that can be easily tapped into at will projections.
<br>
<br>
I started putting together a spreadsheet and am tracking my food intake, hours of sleep, and dates of projections - false awakening, and lucid dreams.

sometimes forcing it can burn one out. the other night I was tinkering with the alarm clock and see if it would help. i was able to produce a obe but the length was short and not fruitful. during the whole morning i was in the repetitive cycle of awake/sleep and messed up the whole day.

With regards to keeping 'in touch' with Robert Monroe,
<br>
-actually yes, the TMI gang and junkies do have rendezvous with him during the advanced courses.
<br>
Pretty intense and fulfilling!

<br>
BTW,
<br>
HI ALL! Frank and Major Tom!
<br>
I am Back...had to furlough when worked off a ship for a while....
<br>
Then I just returned from Stephen LaBerge's 10 day Lucid Dream Camp in Hawaii!
<br>
<br>
WOW! talk about cool...LaBerge Walks his talk!
<img alt=":!:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

I've spread this forum over into the Lucid forums and groups too!
<br>
AstralPulse is second to NONE!

Thanks MajTom!

<br>
<br>
Yes, LaBerge does have his 'theories' regarding LD and OOB. But at least he took a real risky career step back in early 80's and brought "this" into the Both the Academia and Science community!
<br>
And being at Stanford holds a lot water too.
<br>
<br>
His work in the labs have been fantastic...his lab rats have been able to signal with their eyes once they are lucid; then, accomplish several tasks to link reality with dreamland, etc.
<br>
They have done experiments to show how TIME exists in the LD world....essentially it is the Same as in waking reality. Subjects would eye signal for what they estimated was 10 seconds, one minute, etc. and they were dead on or damn close to a waking person's estimations.
<br>
<br>
His sex LD lab rat studies too were very interesting as well as Hilarious!  Subjects had to go "find someone in their LD to get laid..."In the interest of Science" !
<br>
<br>
Yes, the camp was well worth it. It is great to see how far people are bringing modern science into this 'wider reality'. But too, when confront the medical establishment....uh well....it's still just....unexplained!
<br>
<br>
Yeah, riiiight!

Oilfieldpilot,
<br>
<br>
I read Stephen's book "Lucid Dreaming" back in the day. How does Stephen compare lucid dreams to OOBE's.  Its been awhile and I know he's done some incredible studies and explorations with this.
<br>
<br>
My biggest question is: How can a projector or NDE person (near death experience) verify targets and experiments when Stephen dismiss this as a lucid dream?

<section>
Thanks MajTom for the reference!
<br>
<br>
We tried to hit this point at the camp. Unfortunately time ran out as this was one of those extraordinary topics.
<br>
This camp also was shared by a Buddist Guru who took center stage for half+ of the program. Those who are into that kinda thing really benefited.
<br>
But while I learned a lot....I also learned that buddism is JUST ANOTHER RELIGION AND BELIEF...actually....a BUNCH of conflicting beliefs...depending on what Type of buddism one believes in. In this case...the speaker followed Tibetan tradition. I cornered him and questioned his belief about "Time". I told him to tell me that "his" time was not linear (as it CLEARLY was linear in his belief) but in the end, he could not...which proved to me, his form of buddism was created by the mind of man...in the 3d-5 sense world. EVerything was past life past life past life...I brought the question of "OK, what about your 'future life'? If time does not exist, then seeing a future life is just as easy as a 'past' life...but this was stepping on toes...For it would erase and negate the wonderful mystery of the Dali Lama...who interestingly enough seems to ALWAYS come back as a man!!!
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
If Mr Dali does what so many other (sssshhhhhhhh: "Normal")  projectors can do, such as remote viewing and see future events, even perhaps their own future lives...then what Dali claims he (all of the He's) can do....is essentially no big deal!
<br>
<br>
Well. IMHO.
<br>
<br>
OK, sorry to get off subject there, but much of this camp covered budda dreaming stuff. It was not for phasers like myself.
<br>
So unfortunately we only got half of Laberge in that sense.
<br>
<br>
The referenced article from Maj Tom, however....first off, it is out of date; last reference was 1989. Just looking at this forum and the people who experience OOB and other Phasing experiences, clearly shows Many forms of OOBs are NOT DREAMS! IMHO.
<br>
From my Own experiences, How could I see and know what was about to happen (whether in a few seconds, minutes, or days) in a dream, and it be exactly what followed in waking reality? And experiences that I was not even a part of sometimes....just a 'fly on the wall' per say.
<br>
<br>
And how could Monroe do all he did if those were just Dreams??? And Any level of LD???
<br>
And Joe McMoneagle and the Remote viewing he nailed time and time again ...I've heard his talks ( he lives near Monroe Inst. (is extended family) and comes for Thursday pizza)...and he tells the whole story, not what you see of him on TV when he was put to the test (which he blew away). Unfortunately, TV viewers didn't see what he really did, and wouldn't let TV release it...but it blew their socks off and scared the producer poop-less!
<br>
This was NOT LUCID DREAMING! How Can it be?
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I am wrong, but following Monroe's and Now Frank's wonderfully simplified Phasing, LD is just one of the Focus levels...the land of the millions of wanderings, I think is what he calls it.
<br>
Now this makes sense to me:-) at least with MY experiences...
<br>
<br>
So, TVOS brings to light the ongoing debate!
<br>
Perhaps we can take this topic to the OOB discussion?
<br>
I would really like to elaborate and get other's views on this too.
<br>
I will talk to Laberge and Lucidity more on this too. (I've already rattled the cage)

<section>
Oilfieldpilot,
<br>
<br>
I read Stephen's material a long time ago and its good to be objective on his approach and reading. But it still (to me) doesn't answer near verified death experiences, out of body/phasing verifications, clairvoyance, esp etc. I think this is where Stephen falls short and can't back this up.
<br>
<br>
Its not guess work, or someone presented the answers to us ahead of time. As of lately, I've been working on the card experiments and its coming along good with verification. Not to mention, when I projected last week, had no idea it was going to rain in the physical (hours later), but in the astral rain was pouring down.  Coincidence? I doubt it!
<br>
<br>
Its too bad that Stephen brought in the Buddhist Guru and direct questions about phasing/oobe/vibrations etc he could have shed light on. Why did time run out? Was this a topic that Stephen was trying to avoid or could not answer?
<br>

Hi TVOS!
<br>
<br>
The camp was 10 days, but as I said, we only got about half of that with Stephen. This was the year he invited the "eastern" thinking into the program (once every 3 yrs or so). The Budda-gurus are really into all that yoga, energy, and meditation...enlightenment stuff.
<br>
But it didn't appeal to those of us who really "believe" that it is just another religion...one of Monroe's Belief Spheres.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the guru was good and shared lots of dream yoga....well, talked about it at least. I tried to get into it, but 15 min sessions with someone talking was too distracting
<img alt=":cry:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cry.png" title="Cry"/>
<br>
<br>
At the end of the program, those of us who were more into the facts and not fantasy, highly encouraged the staff that we wanted more...and the idea of some really tailored "graduate" programs are hopefully in the works!
<br>
<br>
I have brought this to the Lucidity forum (from the camp, so I 'think' it's private...but not sure. )
<br>
I was told this from a member who has been an  LDer and TLI junkie for quite some time:
<br>
Here is his reply to essentially your and our questions:
<br>
<br>
+++++++++++
<br>
AK, just a word on semantics, regarding all of the experiences you mention, asking how can they be LDs: Remember, no experience can be an LD unless 1)you are asleep, 2)you are dreaming, and 3)you know you're dreaming. You have to have all three going.
<br>
<br>
So, if you are not asleep, it can't be an LD; if you are asleep, but happen to believe you're OOB, it also can't be an LD. In the latter case, however, it could be a dream that's not recognized as such.
<br>
<br>
There's a lot of material on the forum already on OBE's and other states, and a good article comparing OBE and dreams on the Lucidity Institute website,
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.lucidity.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.lucidity.com
</a>
. See:
<br>
<br>
Varieties of Lucid Dreaming Experience
<br>
Stephen LaBerge * and Donald J. DeGracia
<br>
<br>
Keep those great questions coming!
<br>
P.
<br>
============
<br>
<br>
Another thing I did notice at dreamcamp. I inquired to a staff member, who also has done Monroe for over 20 years, LD questions regarding sleepwalking. LaBerge tends to reallllly stick to the Definition of REM. and LD's happen in REM....but one MUST, by definition, have the sleep paralysis. SO, a sleepwalker cannot be in REM, by definition. But this is not to say we do not dream in Other sleep levels...ie the deeper delta and theta levels.
<br>
I questioned this as I come from a family of adult sleepwalkers, and we act out our dreams very much like Lucid dreaming.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, their definition of LD shows to me that OOB (and IB as I call some if my experiences, as I never left my physical, but experienced presence AND future events concurrently) and AP....which clearly can and DO happen when we are awake...and never passed thru sleep cycles to get there...can NOT be any form of LD. Apples and oranges.
<br>
<br>
On the otherhand, I also believe one can have OOBs while IN LDs...as I myself have had these too!
<br>
I had an OOB while in an LD when I was  at Gateway! (actually when we were on a break...of all times!)
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps...but I think we've merely scratched the tip of the iceberg.
<br>
<br>
I mentioned taking this to the general forum to get other opinions? since this is a quiet corner in the Permanent Topics.....

<br>
Thank You for sharing the information with us all. In your statement what future events were you able to validate from your OOBE experience? Anything to do with the card experiment, validation of numbers, names, past life,tragic event?
<br>
<br>
Another interesting fact since I started executing this card verification, the numbers or suit on the cards do not change when I view during the OOBE. I've verified this three times already by looking at the card, looking away and back at the card. According to the ld studies that numbers, names change during the lucid dream.

<br>
<br>
Secondly, one of the experiments that I had setup was video recording my physical body falling to sleep. Estimated by the time stamp of the video that it took me 5-10 mins to put myself into the trance state and have the OOBE.  The video shows that the duration of the of the experience lasted about 3 minutes.
<br>
<br>
Nothing spectacular from the video showed only a physical body sleeping during oobe. The few things that I will point out is that my facial expression twitched as the heavy vibrations ran its course and my arm lifting. During the oobe I was waving my astral hands, screaming, and exited the body to a distanced traveled 20ft. While I was out, I threw objects around, screamed and was pulled back.
<br>
<br>
My study experiment of trial and error lasted two months. The hardest part of the whole experiment was sleeping with the lights on, pressure from video recording trying to produce the oobe.
<br>
<br>
I really do want to revisit this again and now that technology is on our side, I plan on purchasing a few IP video cameras that will record my physical body and target locations in my house.
<br>
<br>
My question to you if you? How long does it take for REM sleep to activate? Five minutes, 1hr, 2hrs? Correct my if I'm wrong on this but I was reading that the lucid dream occurs in stage 5 after 90 minutes into the sleeping rhythm?  I know for a fact when I have my OOBE's its within the first 15 to 30 minutes. Also,  when I awake in the morning and go back to sleep the projection is instant during the transition to the trance state.
<br>
<br>
Well, I've typed all I can for now - sorry about the length and questions.

<section>
Hi again!
<br>
Wow, you've really done some work! I'll be interested in your future results as well!
<br>
<br>
I'll clarify something I didn't before. So far, or only until recently, ALL of my "experiences" have been spontaneous.
<br>
What I called my In-body experiences and future -seeing, what actually would happen, and verry often when I was a kid,
<br>
I would be wide awake...say, standing in a yard around family and friends, just minding my own biz...this is an easy example. Then I would see...'experience' in full 5 senses, something that was about to happen; usually a few minutes later in reality. Best way I can explain, it was as though I was multi-tasking. My Current reality in which everyone else was experiencing, as 'time' ticked away, was still there, if full, no change. I didn't see, feel any nonsense like a fog/haze/lightheadedness...but the 'forward viewing' was as if I was able to experience what was about to happen, AND what was really happening, AT the same time. It is a Knowing, but you see, feel, hear, taste, smell the event that is about to happen, before it happens. And no..it was not "flashing" scenes, or as if you'd been hit by a falling cinder block. Just as you are sitting and reading this, the experience flows smoothly and you just experience it as it unfolds. And then when it Actually Does happen, you simply...re-live the experience...same feelings, gee I hope this makes sense!
<br>
It is literally experiencing 2 experiences at once. The one now, and the one about to happen. And there is No strangeness at all when this happens...it just meshes in like it belongs there!
<br>
And so you just wait a while and within a few minutes, to the next day (less frequent)the exact same unfolds...and no...I never changed anything either. I did not know to. Strange part, it is much different from intuition, a self-preservation thing going on I suppose.?
<br>
<br>
And to answer your question, YES, everything I "saw" or experienced, unfolded later with 100% accuracy, or to me, it was an exact copy, or replay of events. Neat huh?
<br>
<br>
Only recently have I realized you can take control and do these things At Will! So that is my current quest!
<br>
<br>
I don't feel I need to "Test" what is happening...or prove anything to myself. I know it happens. I just want to Do it when I want, and explore deeper, farther, and within. AND have fun with LD and use them to better myself in things I do in waking life
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps to clarify my previous post a bit!

<section>
Oilfieldpilot and other Ap Friends,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's a detailed journal of the video astral projection that I recorded on 3/5/1996. I reviewed the tape last night and refreshed my viewing of the event.
<br>
<br>
To be exact, it took me 9mins  37 seconds to enter the trance state with the vibrations running their course, heavy and painful.  My face expressions you can see a sudden jolt with my which signaled the vibrations running its course.
<br>
<br>
The experience started when the vibrations kicked in and when I finally awakened. The total running time is 8 mins  34 seconds. The time of the experience in the astral seemed 2-3 minutes, but in the physical it was 8 mins and 34 seconds to be exact. So I guess that time is accelerated in the astral while in the physical is slow?
<br>
<br>
Well, anyways here's the journal in its glory. I can't wait until I get the ip cameras and do more research with this. Do I believe that astral projection exists "Yes" and we are able to survive outside of the body after death or during physical life "Yes". Why the need to experiment? - Its my analytical mind and curiosity to test,experiment, and hopeful my data will help others along their path.
<br>
<br>
BTW: Once I purchase a video capture device I will upload it to this site for research and review.
<br>
<br>
<br>
=================
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
03/05/1993
<br>
4:38am-4:56am
<br>
<br>
*The Astral Projection Recorded*
<br>
*To VHS Video Tape!*
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: To bend light is a metaphor that I heard in a movie of making oneself invisible. Also, the time on the VHS video was super long play, hence duration time of the experience was longer then sequence of events.
<br>
<br>
<br>
For the last past 4 months I've been trying to capture on VHS video tape a astral-projection, but there have been many attempts of failure due to many variables. I believe that the camera is a mental barrier in the way of my astral projections in trying to capture it on video tape, but tonight I changed that.
<br>
<br>
I was downloading a few files to my Macintosh computer and decided
<br>
to leave the lights on in my room with the video camera recording. I'd say that it took me about ten minutes to enter the hypnotic state, how I get there I really don't know, I just wake up while my body is asleep and I have the ability to bend light.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once I awakened into the hypnotic state I knew that the camera was
<br>
recording so I tried the following experiments:
<br>
<br>
Screaming "Rush, I'm here, or Ahhhhhhhhh...."
<br>
Waving my hands in front of me
<br>
<br>
Feeling the vibrations and making them stronger
<br>
<br>
From that point on I fell to the floor hitting the side of the bed really
<br>
hard feeling the pain and making a loud noise. I could feel the sensation of
<br>
being pulled back to the physical body but I was able embrace myself
<br>
against the bed to resist the pull. While looking around the room I didn't
<br>
get the chance to see if the video camera was there or if my physical body
<br>
was there either.
<br>
<br>
Looking at the door entrance to my room, I decided to bring
<br>
the door to me without mobility, once I was at the door I cruised down
<br>
to the hallway and into the front room.  The front room was pitch black
<br>
and very hard to see the details of the room, also the only thing I could
<br>
really see was the front door. I made it to the front door but was
<br>
immediately pulled back to the physical body, from there I awakened with
<br>
a little confusing of what took place, shook my head like I was in a trance or something.. I knew that I succeeded in recording the physical body while my soul was able to bend light.
<br>
<br>
First thing I did was rewind the tape on the camera to view
<br>
the physical body movements during the astral-projection. I wasn't
<br>
expecting to see much but I managed to keep calm while the tape was
<br>
rewinding.
<br>
<br>
Looking thru the camera eye-lens I saw my physical body just as if I was sleeping, I could see a few movements of my body but nothing
<br>
extraordinary. I also saw that I was raising my arm up in the air a little bit like I was batting something away, like a fly for example.
<br>
<br>
About ten seconds before awakening my eyes opened up for about 5 seconds then closed, after that again my eyes opened then I shook my head like I was in a trance or a spell and reality came to me of what just took place.
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Sequence Of Physical Body Movements *

<br>
<br>
4:47am  My body jerked once which you also could see it on the facial
<br>
expression. (Note: This is when the vibrations hit )
<br>
<br>
4:49am  Head turns to the right.

<br>
4:49am  Seconds later I raise my hand a little bit to scratch my face then
<br>
the hand rests itself upon the chest.

<br>
4:53am  My head moves a little bit.

4:53am  Seconds later my arm lifts a little bit up in the air to

bat away something. Example: like batting away a fly.

<br>
4:56am  Eyes open again, shook my head back n fourth which looked
<br>
like I was hypnotized or in a trance state that I had just
<br>
snapped out of. I saw on my face that I was thinking of what
<br>
just happened, took a few seconds to realize than I jumped
<br>
out of bed anxiously to see the playback of the recorded
<br>
astral-projection.

Labouts,
<br>
<br>
Towards the very end of the experience, my eyes flicked open quickly and closed. About 30 seconds later I shook my head and awakened from the trance to physical. I believe that my astral body was re-aligning, adjusting and transferring my higher mental awareness shifting it back to the physical.
<br>
<br>
At times, I've noticed when I awaken to the physical its brief and I enter the trance state quickly. This is because my physical body is so tired and easily accessible to fall asleep quicker then the norm. With that in mind, using imagination, feeling oneself roll around in circles the transfer of consciousness from lower to higher is easier.
<br>
<br>
Hope this answers your question!
<br>
