Lately I have been experiencing very intense Deja'vu experiences. To the extent that I know I have either dreamed or have somehow been in the exact situation before. Does any one feel these very intense feelings and have been able to use techniques to work with them and decipher the reason behind it.

<section>
Hehe, this is great, Frank.
<br>
<br>
Just yesterday I had a deja vu
<i>
 about having
</i>
a deja vu.
<br>
<br>
I was watching a show on television and it reminded me of a deja vu I had the first time I had seen that episode. That previous deja vu may or may not have been a deja vu of a deja vu as well. Maybe the first time, I was remembering a deja vu I would have in the
<i>
 future
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Hmmm.

I knew you were going to say that. It always happens when this deja-vu thing comes up. Someone I know ends up saying something about what I thought would happen. :)

We toast the Lisp programmer who pens his thoughts within nests of parentheses.
<br>
<br>
Ha! I bet you didn't think I was going say that, did you?
<br>
<br>
How come I never have deja vu's about winning the lottery...

I swear on my life the thought about the lottery crossed my mind. Maybe that's an "omen" and I should enter the midweek draw this coming Wednesday. Now all I need is the proverbial dream to forecast the numbers. :)
<br>
<br>
I know I'm not going to win, so is that deja-vu? Or is that me foretelling the future? I think it would only be the former after the event. If so then that would be a bit strange since deja-vu literally means "already considering". So on that basis my foretelling my fate correctly could be held to be deja-vu, but then we only know whether I was correct or not after the event. Hmm...

Jrd,
<br>
<br>
I've had these experiences as well, and they seem to come in waves for me (a few in a matter of a week or so, then maybe nothing for months).  I haven't been able to decipher whether they
<i>
 mean
</i>
anything, but they do seem to happen when I meditate every day for say, more than a week in a row.  Other than that, I can discern no pattern to them.  I do remember having the experiences at a very young age as well (kindergarten, if not before).

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You'd imagine when people think "deja-vu" they would assume the topic would have come up a number of times before. :)

Isn't it possible to look up lottery numbers in the akashic records?

Yes. You're right.

It's just a thought.
