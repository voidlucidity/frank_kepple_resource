Admittedly I haven't experienced it enough times to know whether it's a coincidence, and by now it could even be a subconscious trigger without there being any real correlation.  But, it seems that as rare as it is for me to spontaneously wake up paralyzed with vibes, it almost always seems to happen on or around the full moon.  There have only been two full moons since I started paying attention to this possible trigger, but the next is tonight, and I'll be making sure to go to bed early, doing NEW and meditating for a while just in case my chances really are any better.
<br>
<br>
I've made this thread to see if anyone else has noticed this, and to perhaps get others to pay attention who might not have made the connection before.
<br>
<br>
Also, to keep track of the lunar cycle I found this page with a little module that does so:

</a>
<br>
<br>
Also worthy of note is that the page I first saw it on had this to say...
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  <br>
  Dr. Dave Oester: We have found that two or three days on each side of the full and new moons are the best times for conducting ghost investigations and also during solar storms. We have been teaching that peak geomagnetic fields are the best times since 1994. Peak hauntings seem to occur during peak geomagnetic conditions.

...which I found interesting as well.  So, thoughts?

<br>
It has a place where you can copy code to stick it on your own page, but for anyone who doesn't feel like doing that, I've uploaded my own:

I know when I was first attuning myself to the sensation of energies, it would always seem that when it was easiest to become aware of the energy body the full moon would happen to be out.  I haven't really been keeping tabs on this for the past year though.  But then again, I wasn't trying to keep tabs on it when I first noticed it.  I just happened to have a very strong awarness of energy and I would note that at those times the full moon would be out.  Now, I can't say that I notice my awareness being clearer? at some times over others.  Things seem to have smoothed out over the past year.

RB mentioned it in astral dynamics but I seem to be the only one at this site that experiences more projections the week before and a couple days after the full moon.

Hi,
<br>
About 6 or 7 months ago I kept a log of when I experienced projection phenomena against the lunar cycle for the given time, just to see if there was any correlation.
<br>
<br>
Looking back I can see that in the beginning most phenomena, such as projections, vibrations and astral vision occured when the Moon was 'Waxing' or becoming fuller.
<br>
<br>
Things seemed to have now levelled off and I find that I now have experiences when the Moon is Waxing and Waning.
<br>
<br>
I can imagine using the Moon as a trigger object for incubating an experience, the only problem I foresee is that by planting a subconscious seed in ones mind that one can only have these experiences when the Moon is in such and such a state could result in one depriving oneself of experiences for the remainder of the month.
<br>
<br>
Cheers
<br>

Never noticed any connection myself, and I can't see what a difference it would make. Perhaps it is one of those things where if you believe it makes a difference then it does.

Hi,
<br>
I also notice much more personal energetic activity (during meditation etc) a week either side of a full moon.
<br>
It was much more pronounced during my earlier days of development &amp; took me several (infuriating) months to make the correlation.
<br>
By more pronounced I mean that I couldn't figure out why there were periods of extreme activity followed by periods of extreme in-activity.
<br>
Just making the connection was very helpful &amp; released the anxiety regarding these two extremes &amp; WHY they were occuring.
<br>
<br>
I find it has eased with time &amp; continued use of NEW &amp; conclude that, for me, the phase of the moon should be taken into consideration &amp; fully expect that further "spiritual growth spurts" will probably begin to manifest around a full moon.
<br>
<br>
Here is a link to a stand-alone, freeware utility that I use to check moon phases:
