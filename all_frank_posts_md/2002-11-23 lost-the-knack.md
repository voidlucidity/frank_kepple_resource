How were you flying in the astral before you stopped? What made you stop? Why do you want to start again? These are all questions you should ask yourself. Astral projection is a very deep personal experience and I have found that if you meditate and communicate with your inner self all your answers will come to you. You have already had astral experiences so you know the reality of it and you know what to expect so all that is needed to begin again is personal communication with your inner self.

All past Atsral flight was unexpected and uncontrolled---------very frightening experiences due to the fact that I battlled with them-------- because I did not understand what was happening to me,twelve years have passed since I have experienced any,I am now older and wiser also interested in learning more about what happened to me and what could happen again if I get past the fear that has prevented me from having the experience, I was a natural Asral flyer who thought she was leaving her body through death-------know much more now though,just want to know if I can have back what i lost

Yes, you will get back what you lost. I know this because I know that all Â it takes is the will to do so, and you have that will. Let the adventures begin!!

Yes, Helen, your experiences are like so many others where, because of limited understanding, people have tried to "fight" their experiences rather than understand them for what they are. Your protective sense of conscious awareness is an ever so fragile aspect of the human self which bruises easily.
<br>
<br>
What I do is always treat my protective sense of conscious awareness as a separate aspect of self and introduce it to situations very gradually. Like a mother would do with a child, for example. You need to talk to it and encourage it to come along with you, rather than oppose you. After all, this aspect of you
<i>
 is
</i>
trying to protect you at the end of the day (well, that's what it thinks it is doing).
<br>
<br>
In the beginning, your protective sense of self will baulk at every little thing. The slightest odd sound, the tiniest flash of light or slightly weird bodily sensation, and it zaps you right back to Physical (C1 consciousness). You will often read posts about people's experiences where, just as they seem to be making a little progress and losing sensation of their physical body at Mental Focus 10, they drift further to Focus 12 and that's right where you start to hear odd sounds or visions of abstract images, etc. The very instant they hear, see or feel the slightest thing,
<i>
 rather than interpreting them for what they are, i.e. clear signposts that serve to confirm your progress
</i>
, they get zapped right out of it.
<br>
<br>
But no matter how proficient you become, you will always have odd moments where your progress is halted. Either you get stuck at a point within the Astral somewhere through lack of understanding as to what to do next, or you get zapped back to Physical. The latter is very annoying but it does serve as a useful sign that you are overloading your protective sense of awareness.
<br>
<br>
This is yet another good reason why it is far better to keep your adventures short. To me, it is way more beneficial to have 3 short, to the point projections in succession with near 100% recall; rather than one long adventure where you end up flitting here there and everywhere and get zapped back remembering next to nothing. Except, of course, that it was all very freaky.
<br>
<br>
In your specific case, what I would do is to write your protective sense of self a letter. Explain about all the trauma both of you had in the past and the reasons why these problems occured. State how you now have new knowledge and understanding that will overcome the difficulties you had 12 years ago. This should "clear the air" and get the pair of you on an even keel.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hi Helen
<br>
I think the first thing to do is to overcome your fear of the Astral I came across something that might help you
<blockquote id="quote">
 <font face='"Arial"' id="quote" size="1">

  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
  Most of the great astral projectors of the past have written about something akin to the fear barrier. Forhan, in particular, notes the instinctive dread he felt any time something new and unexpected happened to him during his projections. Contacting a new dimension, confronting a disembodied entity for the first time, or having odd physical sensations all ignited this inherent trepidation. Gradually, however, he came to realize that the OBE world is primarily a mental one. Nothing could actually hurt him while he was out-of-body; it was his own fear that so often victimized him. He eventually discovered that he could change his environment and disperse any would-be astral attacker merely by an exercise of will. Once he learned this great secret, he never again worried about his well-being while out-of-body.

I hope this helps you to understand that there is nothing to fear but fear itself.
<br>

Happy Travels
