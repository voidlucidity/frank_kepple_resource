<section>
I am new to this forum, and would like to provide a little background.  When I was a teenager I had a spontaneous OBE.  I was laying in my bed in he morning, and I had an allergic reaction to a skin medication.  I remember floating in the center of my bedroom, and rotating in slow circles.  This went on for about 20 seconds.  Next, I found myself paralyzed in my bed.  I was scared out of my mind.  I couldn't scream, move, etc.  I thought I had almost died, and put the experience behind me.
<br>
<br>
Within the last year I had another spontaneous obe whereby I shot out of my body through the roof of my house into the sky, and then right back down again.  I awoke with a jolt.  My wife thought I was crazy when I described the two episodes, so I decided to investigate a little more.  Never did I realize that there were so many people drawn to AP/OOBE.
<br>
<br>
I have been faithfully practicing relaxing/concentration exercises for the last 3 weeks.  I have been able to enter the trance state and paralyze my body.  However, I am having problems inducing vibrations.  Are there any tried and true technqiues for bringing on the vibrations.  I've had the vibrations only once in the last few weeks, but wasn't sure what brought them on.
<br>
<br>
Any help would greatly be appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Thanks-
<br>

<section>
Well, from my experience, getting your body numb and paralyzed (like you have done) is only HALF the journey.  Most people think, "If I get my body paralyzed, then the vibrations are supposed to come next."  Not necessarily true.
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are getting your body numb (devoid of feeling) but you are still aware of it.  After all, the only way you could know that your body was numb was to have an internal dialogue with yourself where to say, "Wow, I know I am in bed, but I can't feel anything anymore!"
<br>
<br>
This is just the first step.  Before you can induce the vibrations (which, by the way, not everyone will feel...it varies from person to person), to must FORGET about your body.  That means not even thinking about it anymore.  Usually, what happens to me is that I allow myself to just slip off into a sleep state for just a bit.  Since my mind is calm and still at this point, I don't slip off into a dream.  But I lose consciousness for just the right amount of time to totally forget about my physical body in bed.
<br>
<br>
Usually, at this point, you will snap back to consciousness, either with a buzzing feeling, or a vibrational feeling.
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you're on the right track though.  Keep it up!

The vibrations occur when the mind loses track of the body? Okay. Where do the vibrations occur and of what do they consist? I thought that the body was a container for the vibrations and that if the body was forgotten then the vibrations must instantly recall it.

Jeff,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the advice.  I will make an effort to take it now to the next level.  Now that you mention it, I was consciously trying to evaluate whether or not I was fully paralyzed.
<br>
<br>
I've heard, even maybe from this forum, that there is a high pitch rining sound when all is quiet.  I can hear this.  Someone mentioned that if you were to focus your energies on just listening to this sound that this would then induce vibrations.  Do you know of what I am talking about, and if there is any truth in it?

<br>
<br>
Again, focusing on a sound is just one of the many ways to get your focus off your physcial body.  By tuning into an audio stream in your head, some people lose all thoughts about their body, thus bringing them closer to a projection state.  So you see, it isn't the SOUND itself that makes you have an OBE, but the sound helps you focus on something other than the relaxation that is happening in your body.
<br>
<br>
Me personally, I don't use this technique.  I am more of a visual person, so I try to focus on the hypnogogic imagery behind my eyes.
<br>
<br>
Tom: I am not sure what you are getting at, so forgive me.  To me, the vibrations are like an energetic reaction when my astral body is laying slightly out of sync with the physical.  If you focus on them, they will be more noticable.  Usually, I don't focus on them so they aren't that strong with me.
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.

Vibration induction was the topic. I have something to quote on it.
<br>
<br>
Leaving the Body A Complete Guide to Astral Projection by D. Scott Rogo. New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore: Prentiss Hall Press, 1983, 1986, 1993. ISBN 0-671-76394-6
<br>
<br>
chapter 6
<br>
<br>
Remove any and all jewelry or other accoutrements that might be touching your skin.
<br>
Darken the room so that no light can be seen through your eyelids, but do not shut out all light.
<br>
Lie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your head pointed toward magnetic north. (No reason is given for this specific position.)
<br>
Loosen all clothing, but keep covered so that you are slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable.
<br>
Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time when, there will be absolutely no noise to disturb you.
<br>
Enter a state of deep relaxation.
<br>
Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember all that occurs during the upcoming session that will be beneficial to your well-being. Repeat this suggestion five times.
<br>
Proceed to breathe through your half-opened mouth.
<br>
As you breathe, concentrate on the void in front of you.
<br>
Select a point a foot away from your forehead, then change your point of mental reference to six feet.
<br>
Turn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary line parallel to your body axis up and above your head. Focus there and reach out for the "vibrations" at that point and bring them back into your body.
<br>
<br>
Exactly what are these "vibrations" that you are reaching for? And how do you bring them back into your head? Monroe is very vague on this issue, but he offers some information about what seems to be a way of mentally contacting them:
<br>
<br>
The only way to understand the vibrations is to experience them. Another way of making contact with the vibrations is by imagining that two lines are extending from your closed eyelids and converging about a foot or so away from your forehead. At the point where these two lines meet, try to experience a resistance or "pressure." You might imagine something like the sensation that would be experienced if poles of a magnet were forced together or if two electrical wires made contact. Proceed by extending this focal point about three feet away from you. As Monroe explains, "A compression of the space [forces?] between the converging lines must result, and the pressure must therefore increase to maintain the convergence." He goes on to suggest that you now extend the junction another three feet away, so that it rests at about a 30-degree angle from your head. Monroe suggests you even work out this angle with a protractor so that you can visualize it correctly. "Once," he continues, "you have learned to establish and maintain the 30-degree angle outward (or roughly six feet away), send the point of intersection 90-degrees (or in an 'L') upward in the direction of your head, but parallel to the axis of your body. You 'reach' with this point of intersection. Stretch with the point more and more until you obtain a reaction."
<br>
<br>
Monroe asserts that you will know when a reaction has been reached. You will experience it as a surging, a hissing, or a pulsation inside the head. The vibrations will then surge through the entire body.
<br>
<br>
These are preliminary exercises, and Monroe assures the student that after due practice, he or she will be able to enter the state of vibration at will.
<br>
<br>
Step five: Learn to control the vibrational state. After learning how to achieve this state, you must now begin exploring its many subtleties. Practice inducing the vibrations until you are no longer frightened by the waves and electrical feelings that accompany them. Monroe also suggests that you just relax and passively observe these vibrations until they are familiar to you. At that time you should practice controlling them by mentally pushing them into your head, down into your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body, and creating vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate on the vibrations and mentally "push" a wave out of the head and guide it down the body. Practice this procedure until you can induce these waves instantly on mental command. If the vibrations seem rough or shaky – remember that Bayless felt as if his body were being shaken by an earthquake – Monroe recommends that you mentally increase the vibrational rate. This will even them out.
<br>
<br>
Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready to actually leave the body.

<section>
A longer quote, with some of the same material:
<br>
<br>
Monroe has developed several methods for leaving the body, based primarily on his own personal experiences. He has revised these techniques considerably over the years, and the current program currently taught at the Monroe Institute is very different from the methods he originally recommended in 1971 when his autobiography was published. In January 1982, a spokesperson for the Institute specifically told me that Monroe's original writings on OBE induction practices (circa 1971) are now outmoded. Such a great difference exists between his autobiographical writings and his current week-long program that some description of each should be given. In this section we will be looking at those methods that Monroe himself used to leave the body and that, according to his own account, he used when he successfully produced his OBEs in the laboratory. In the next section, we'll be taking a look at his Institute's program.
<br>
<br>
Monroe clearly believes that the OBE is a human potential we are all capable of developing. He has even written that "the only possible way for an individual to appreciate the reality of the Second Body and existence within it is to experience it for himself." He adds, noncommittally however, that "whether or not anyone should is beyond the scope of my judgment."
<br>
<br>
Monroe contends that before actually attempting to leave the body, various a priori conditions must be met. Chief among these is the intense desire to have an OBE, which is probably similar to what earlier writers referred to as the "will" to experience the state. He also stresses that the experimenter must possess a certain degree of psychological strength. After first leaving the body, Monroe began having chronic OBEs. Somehow he had opened a door that could no longer be shut. He advises the student that he or she must reckon with this same problem. Having once induced an OBE, there is no turning back. You will have to live with your decision to leave the body for the rest of your life.
<br>
<br>
Your next problem will be dealing with your friends and relatives. Leaving the body is an ability that places you in a new relationship with those around you. You must be willing to be labeled a freak, insane, or merely a liar, since many of your friends and relatives will not be willing to accept the validity of your experiences. You must also be prepared for a certain amount of ostracism.
<br>
<br>
Monroe's warnings are well taken, especially when so many members of the general public are becoming interested in spiritual growth. Hugh Callaway was an occultist, Sylvan Muldoon a spiritualist, and Marcel Louis Fprhan a mystic who lived in China for a good portion of his life. These men moved in social circles that were totally open-minded to claims of the paranormal. You might not find yourself in the same position.
<br>
<br>
Take the case of a young hospital worker who developed rather remarkable psychokinetic abilities after months of self-development and practice. Her ability to move small objects through the power of thought was filmed, and two top American parapsychological laboratories documented her abilities. Yet, she eventually renounced her gift. She had no problem handling this talent she had unleashed within herself, but she could not handle the reactions of her friends, who were generally ignorant of parapsychology and held no belief in psychic phenomena. They believed that she was merely pulling a sham or was simply self-deluded, and they became very suspicious of her. The emotional strain caused by this ostracism was too great, and finally the young woman ceased demonstrating her ability altogether. Today she lives an uneventful life in New York, where she works quietly as a hematology technician. She takes little active interest in parapsychology.
<br>
<br>
Monroe also warns that a hindering factor in the development of OBE abilities is the "fear barrier" – the student's own resistance to the experience. We all possess a certain inhibition about facing the unknown, and leaving the body is an experience we intuitively associate with either dying or going mad. We, therefore, have a natural fear of leaving the body deeply ingrained in us by our culture and society. Monroe admits that his own fear barrier lasted for several years, and that only after he conquered it could he fully explore his out-of-body potentials. It is just this barrier that keeps us in our bodies and represents the trickiest obstacle one must overcome before achieving the OBE. "I do not know how to circumvent the fear barrier," admits Monroe, "except by cautious initial steps to create familiarity bit by bit as you proceed."
<br>
<br>
Most of the great astral projectors of the past have written about something akin to the fear barrier. Forhan, in particular, notes the instinctive dread he felt any time something new and unexpected happened to him during his projections. Contacting a new dimension, confronting a disembodied entity for the first time, or having odd physical sensations all ignited this inherent trepidation. Gradually, however, he came to realize that the OBE world is primarily a mental one. Nothing could actually hurt him while he was out-of-body; it was his own fear that so often victimized him. He eventually discovered that he could change his environment and disperse any would-be astral attacker merely by an exercise of will. Once he learned this great secret, he never again worried about his well-being while out-of-body.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is a good lesson to learn before you try leaving the body. For practical purposes, the student should diligently study the literature on the OBEs before trying to project. The writings of the great astral projectors of yesteryear are especially good in this regard. They will prepare you for what you may experience while separated from your body. Had I known what I do today about the OBE, I do not think I would have been so uneasy about some of my initial experiences, such as the paralysis, the feeling of being sucked out of my body against my will, the vicious white faces I saw during one of my first incipient releases, and other encounters I had on the road to self-discovery.
<br>
<br>
Having psychologically prepared yourself for leaving the body, the steps described below may be implemented for inducing the experience.
<br>
<br>
Step one: Relax the body. According to Monroe, "the ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself" to having an OBE. This includes both mental and physical relaxation. Although Monroe offers no specific exercises for relaxing, PMR or self-hypnosis will suffice.
<br>
<br>
Step two: Try to enter the state bordering sleep. Nearly all the great astral projectors have noted that the OBE seems related to that curious state right between waking and sleeping, known as the hypnagogic state. Dr. John Palmer found that his subjects at the University of Virginia who could enter an experimentally induced analog of this state (through ganzfield stimulation) were the most successful at experiencing the OBE. This same finding has been made experimentally, primarily by Sylvan Muldoon and Monroe himself.
<br>
<br>
Just how does one achieve this state voluntarily? The only way is through practice. When you lie down to sleep, observe the fact of falling asleep. When you lie down to sleep, observe the act of falling asleep. As you begin to doze off, try to hold your consciousness intact. At first you will lose your grip and fall asleep. Don't be discouraged. Eventually you will be able instinctively to judge when you are beginning to fall asleep. These cues will allow you to hold on to this twilight zone of consciousness indefinitely.
<br>
<br>
You can also use certain exercises to identify the hypnagogic state. I use a relatively simple one. When you lie down to sleep, hold a single mental image in your mind as long as you can. When other images start popping spontaneously into your mind, you have entered the hypnagogic state.
<br>
<br>
Learn to observe these images and passively study them. This process of observation will actually keep you awake, since the mind will be kept minimally stimulated but not actually aroused. I have used this technique for years and have even trained myself to observe these images, rouse myself, write them down, and then almost immediately return to the hypnagogic state. It is, indeed, all a matter of practice. Another old method of prolonging the hypnagogic state is to rest with your arm bent at the elbow and elevated. When you are just about to fall asleep, your arm will begin to fall and alert you to the fact. Again, with practice, you will eventually be able to hold that state right between waking and sleeping for a considerable amount of time. The key is simply to become aware of it.
<br>
<br>
Monroe does not call this state by its formal psychological name; he simply calls it "Condition A."
<br>
<br>
Step three: Deepen the state. Monroe advises the student to learn how to deepen the hypnagogic state as a prerequisite to leaving the body. The first exercise is to learn how to clear the mind while remaining near sleep. "Do not think of anything, but remain posed between wakefulness and sleep," he advises. "Simply look through your closed eyelids at the blackness ahead of you. Do nothing more. After a number of these exercises, you may hallucinate 'mind pictures' or light patterns. These seem to have no great significance and may merely be forms of neural discharge."* When these images cease, one has entered what Monroe calls Condition B. From here one must learn to enter even deeper into Condition C – a state of such relaxation that one loses all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation. You are almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts.
<br>
<br>
*The "light patterns" one sees while entering sleep are technically called phosphenes and result when any stimulus other than light reaches the retina. They are not neural discharges, but purely optical effects.
<br>
<br>
The ideal state for leaving the body, however, is Condition D. This is the same as Condition C when it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the result of the normal fatigue that brings on sleep. To achieve Condition D, Monroe suggests that you practice entering it after you wake up in the morning or after a short nap. At that point you are refreshed, but still physically and mentally relaxed. Start the exercise before you begin moving about.
<br>
<br>
Although Monroe may disagree with me on this point, what he calls Conditions C and D may actually represent the first stage of actual sleep. It is hard to judge when a person slips from waking into true sleep. Subjects hooked to an EEG so that their brain waves can be monitored not show a discrete changeover from a drowsy condition into sleep; the shift is very gradual. Individuals aroused during their initial light sleep may not even be aware that they have fallen under. They usually describe being preoccupied with their thoughts and do not recollect actually losing consciousness. Monroe seems to be teaching his students how to actually observe the process of waking-into-sleeping with no loss of consciousness. Psychologists now know that, even when we are not dreaming, our minds are occupied in constant mentation. So, Monroe's techniques may also be a systematic method for retaining some awareness of one's thought processes during actual sleep onset.
<br>
<br>
Step four: Enter into a state of vibration. This is the most important part of Monroe's techniques, but it is also the most opaque.
<br>
<br>
Many people who have undergone an OBE have noted the curious "vibrations" that herald its onset. These vibrations can manifest in a variety of amplitudes, from a mild tingling sensation to the feeling that electricity is being shot through the body. Monroe experienced them for several weeks before having his first separation. Yet their cause remains a mystery. They may, indeed, be caused by the actual incipient release of the psychic double, or they may be the result of some sort of proprioceptive stimulation produced when one's normal body awareness is totally eliminated. Monroe does not claim that he knows what causes these curious vibrations, but he feels that producing them deliberately is the most critical step of all in inducing the OBE. For entering into this vibrational state as an adjunct to Condition D, he offers the following directions:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Remove any and all jewelry or other accoutrements that might be touching your skin.
<br>
Darken the room so that no light can be seen through your eyelids, but do not shut out all light.
<br>
Lie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your head pointed toward magnetic north. (No reason is given for this specific position.)
<br>
Loosen all clothing, but keep covered so that you are slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable.
<br>
Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time when, there will be absolutely no noise to disturb you.
<br>
Enter a state of deep relaxation.
<br>
Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember all that occurs during the upcoming session that will be beneficial to your well-being. Repeat this suggestion five times.
<br>
Proceed to breathe through your half-opened mouth.
<br>
As you breathe, concentrate on the void in front of you.
<br>
Select a point a foot away from your forehead, then change your point of mental reference to six feet.
<br>
Turn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary line parallel to your body axis up and above your head. Focus there and reach out for the "vibrations" at that point and bring them back into your body.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exactly what are these "vibrations" that you are reaching for? And how do you bring them back into your head? Monroe is very vague on this issue, but he offers some information about what seems to be a way of mentally contacting them:
<br>
<br>
The only way to understand the vibrations is to experience them. Another way of making contact with the vibrations is by imagining that two lines are extending from your closed eyelids and converging about a foot or so away from your forehead. At the point where these two lines meet, try to experience a resistance or "pressure." You might imagine something like the sensation that would be experienced if poles of a magnet were forced together or if two electrical wires made contact. Proceed by extending this focal point about three feet away from you. As Monroe explains, "A compression of the space [forces?] between the converging lines must result, and the pressure must therefore increase to maintain the convergence." He goes on to suggest that you now extend the junction another three feet away, so that it rests at about a 30-degree angle from your head. Monroe suggests you even work out this angle with a protractor so that you can visualize it correctly. "Once," he continues, "you have learned to establish and maintain the 30-degree angle outward (or roughly six feet away), send the point of intersection 90-degrees (or in an 'L') upward in the direction of your head, but parallel to the axis of your body. You 'reach' with this point of intersection. Stretch with the point more and more until you obtain a reaction."
<br>
<br>
Monroe asserts that you will know when a reaction has been reached. You will experience it as a surging, a hissing, or a pulsation inside the head. The vibrations will then surge through the entire body.
<br>
<br>
These are preliminary exercises, and Monroe assures the student that after due practice, he or she will be able to enter the state of vibration at will.
<br>
<br>
Step five: Learn to control the vibrational state. After learning how to achieve this state, you must now begin exploring its many subtleties. Practice inducing the vibrations until you are no longer frightened by the waves and electrical feelings that accompany them. Monroe also suggests that you just relax and passively observe these vibrations until they are familiar to you. At that time you should practice controlling them by mentally pushing them into your head, down into your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body, and creating vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate on the vibrations and mentally "push" a wave out of the head and guide it down the body. Practice this procedure until you can induce these waves instantly on mental command. If the vibrations seem rough or shaky – remember that Bayless felt as if his body were being shaken by an earthquake – Monroe recommends that you mentally increase the vibrational rate. This will even them out.
<br>
<br>
Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready to actually leave the body.
<br>
<br>
Step six: Begin with a partial separation. The key here is thought control. Keep your mind firmly focused on the idea of leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thoughts may cause you to lose control of the state.
<br>
<br>
Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring the OBE by releasing a hand or leg of the "second body." Monroe suggests that you stick your "hand" out as far as you can and touch a familiar object, such as a wall next to your head. Then push a little more and allow your extremity to go through the object. Return the hand by placing it back into coincidence with your physical one, decrease your vibrational rate, and then terminate the experiment. Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise will prepare you for completely leaving the body.
<br>
<br>
Step seven: Dissociate yourself from the body. Monroe describes two basic techniques for implementing this ultimate separation. One method is to "lift out" of the body. To do so, think about getting lighter and lighter after you have entered the vibrational state. Think how nice it would be to float upward. Keep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extraneous thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will occur naturally at this point.
<br>
<br>
Another method Monroe uses for leaving the body is the "rotation method" or "roll-out" technique. When you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in bed. Do not attempt to turn over physically by moving your arms or legs. Try to twist your body from the top and virtally roll over in your second body right out of your physical self. At this point you will be out-of-body but next to it. Think of floating upward, and you should find yourself floating above your body.
<br>
<br>
Monroe recommends beginning with the lift-out method, but argues that both procedures will be equally efficacious for inducing a total separation.
<br>
<br>
Monroe also offers several suggestions for experiments and exercises that you may wish to try once you have left the body. These experiments will not concern us here, and Monroe's book may be consulted for further details. It is also suggested that one should become familiar with the feeling of being out-of-body before making any further explorations. During first trials, the student should not attempt to leave the room in which he or she is projecting.

<section>
I successfuly induced the vibrations last night.  I coordinated a series of events.
<br>
<br>
1.  Did alot of physical exercise throughtout the date, running, jumping jacks, pushups, etc.
<br>
<br>
2.  Light meditation before going to bed.
<br>
3.  Drank water before going to bed knowing I would get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom.
<br>
4.  Woke up in the middle of the night as planned.
<br>
5.  Instead of going back to sleep without a care in the world laid on my back and began to enter trance stage.
<br>
<br>
At this point something was holding me up on achieving vibrations.  I decided to change positions.  I always laid on my back during practice, but found that my body tensed up to much. Instead I assumed the position that I sleep in, on my side.
<br>
<br>
Change my positioning to laying on my side with the intent of falling asleep.
<br>
<br>
6.  Kept consciousness of my breath while trying to enter sleep like trance.
<br>
7.  As I breathed out, forced a dropping feeling throughout my body as If I was falling.
<br>
<br>
8.  Felt something going on in my head.
<br>
<br>
9.  After about 3 breathes, I had a series of wind chimes going off in my head with my body vibrating.  Color flashes were shooting through my eyes.
<br>
<br>
10.  Rather then try for an OBE right out, I decided to analyze what was going on:
<br>
This is what I found:
<br>
1.  Heart Chakra was highly active with a heavy fast pounding that resonated through my whole body.
<br>
2.  Chimes in dolby surround in my head.  Metallic sound in nature.
<br>
3.  Nervous.  First time experienced from beginning.
<br>
4.  Tried to make it last.  Lasted for about 1 minute before I was to focused on the vibrations and they left.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will try to repeat tonight.  If successful, I feel that waking up early morning definitely provide a kick start.  Physical exercise also.

OW: From what you describe in "10" it sounds like you are absolutely right on the verge of projecting. If you just allow the vibrations to continue, rather than concentrate on them, they should increase in frequency and become more like a buzzing. I found if you actually concentrate too much on the vibrations in a *specific* sense they go away. The way I think of it is you just lie back and bath in them.
<br>
<br>
The colour flashes and wind-chimes, sound like stray energy which is a stage you pass through. Following which the Astral will come into view. I use this stray-energy stage as a kind of milestone that tells me Astral connection is about to take place. The way forward for you is just to allow everything to happen.
<br>
<br>
Once you get used to just allowing things to continue, the whole projection process (from initial feeling in the head, to finding yourself within the Astral) only takes a couple of seconds. As you keep doing it, the vibrations become more of a buzzing with a kind of crackling, electrical sort of noise. Like the sound the big, half-million volt grid distribution cables make on a damp day.

Didn't progress last night.  I believe that I was to anxious.  What is a good rule of thumb regarding attempts?  Should one try every day, or should you stagger attempts every other day to allow your body to store up energy, etc?

Try as often as you can. It is far better to practise 5 minutes per day than 35 minutes once per week. Personally, I don't subscribe to all that energy raising/storing stuff. This morning, for example, I projected a record 4 attempts over about 2 hours. Had a great time, yet feel no different than normal.

Vibration levels are different for each individual.  I had followed all the techniques and consentrated on drawing up as much energy as I could.  At times I felt like I would vibrate out of my bed  and found it very hard to relax enough to enter that fuzzy dream state.  So I just let my body be the judge on how much energy I needed, after all doesn't  our spiritial supposed to leave our bodies everynight without our interviening?  What I'm saying is follow the techniques but maybe not concintrate so much on energy levels and paralized sensations but on bathing in the vibrations that you would call soothing, warm and relaxing.  And also being very content with floating or being in a place that you would call soothing. Picture yourself there,  feel it, not just tell yourself in verbal words.  Feel it, live it and relax.

I've been practicing, etc for the last 3 weeks(going into my forth).  I have been able to reach vibration mode twice, once by happenchance, once by concentrating me efforts.  I have literally practiced 1-2 hours every night.  Sometimes in the beginning, sometimes when I wake up.  Is it possible to exhaust yourself practicing.  Should I break up practice to every other day, or less time?
<br>
<br>
I find it hard to repeat starting the vibrations, but I do not know whether it is because I am too tired, or to anxious.
<br>

Any advice would be helpful.

For me, the problem of trying really really hard is that I wind up getting frustrated and impatient with the process, which makes it even harder to do.  In my previous post, I mentioned that I finally just managed to get out consciously.. this actually happened when I just thought "Oh, might as well have a go again" without putting real pressure on myself. And it actually happened within about ten minutes. So maybe the secret is just to let it be easy, and not try so hard?

<section>
about the practicing. i have been trying to project for about six months now
<br>
and i just got out the other night. i was half asleep and woke up to a halfway projected double and went w/ it.
<br>
<br>
i have had a lot of experience experimenting w/ how much practice can be or should be done in a day or even one sitting. i've had plenty of time on my hands and this has become a big goal of mine to be able to do consciously. sometimes i would practice for about ten hours a day. i'm not doing it unhealthily or anything. im very physically active and the times that i've done practive for about ten hours a day have been spaced out. it's not me jsut lying in my house like a lump for days in a row.
<br>
<br>
<br>
i have done some type of energy/trance work every day for the past six months for at least an hour each day.
<br>
<br>
after plenty of trial and error, i've found the best way to manage time during one day  is to practice for about half an hour to an hour the first time and then to get up and do something fora bout fifteen minutes. lie down and try again for about fifteen minutes. repeat the fifteen minute stages over and over. any stage that you got to earlier you can easily get rigth back to w/ in about a min.  for example...if you can get close to the vibratory state after about an hour of trying, then you get up and move around for about fifteen minutes, then try again.. it should only take about two miinutes to get back to the same stage.
<br>
<br>
it should get easier and faster w/ each fifteen minute shot.  i've found that trying for two hours straight is not the way to do it. i know that it may feel sometime that you are right on the verge of the vibratory state and that you dont want to get up and lose the trance state when you are so close. however, this appears to be much faster, and less tiring, physically and mentally.
<br>
<br>
i've actually found it possible to do some energy and trance work off an on for an hour or two, while able to get myself into a nice level of trance, stopping for an  hour or more and being able to get right back to where i was in about two minutes.
<br>
<br>
if you have any more questions about time management, feel free to ask. i've experimented a lot w/ this and would be glad to help.
<br>
<br>
unfortunately right now i'm having trouble w/ my neck area still. it seemsi cant get it comfortable unless i fall asleep. even though i know i'm in a position where i could easily fall asleep. i'm thinking it may just be psychological. as soon as it clears up i will be able to project in less than ten minutes i think. i feel that i m over developed in all of the other stages leading up to the exit because of how much time i have spent trying to project.
<br>
<br>
the vibratory stage i've been able to acomplish a bunch of differnent times by getting in a good level of trance and then trying to raise as much energy as i could through my entire body. not necessariy from the feet up either. if you just think to yourself that your whole body is about to blow up llike a blowfish w/ massive amounts of energy and actually feel it happening, w/out moving your physical body, it should help.
<br>
<br>
also about the wind chimes you've heard, the astral gateways that are shaped like a tube are filled w/ this type of music and i've often heard this. it's very pleasant sounding and does kind of sound like metal wind chimes.
<br>
somtimes you can hear the music before you actually see the structure.
<br>
<br>
the more you do this stuff the more second nature it becomes. i belive after a while, if we all keep this up, we are going to have more trouble stopping projections than accomplishing them. good luck.

Thanks Fred.
<br>
<br>
You mention Astral Tubes.  This is the first time that I have heard this term.  Exactly what do you mean by this?  Also, I have a question to anyone who can answer.  I heard that if you focus on the high pitch sound you hear when meditating, that that is the equiv. of visualization.  My question however, is what exactly is this high pitch sound that it seems everyone can hear?  Does this high pitch relate in any degree to the state of consciousness that we are currently in?  Does it relate in any way to our vibrational rate?
<br>
<br>
Just curious?

I'm going to throw something out here, just in case it helps someone.
<br>
<br>
I just recently had a "lightbulb moment" during a failed projection attempt.  I was right on the edge of vibrations -- I felt them nearby, akin to the feeling one gets when one feels someone in the room next door.  Then it hit me - - - I'M ALWAYS VIBRATING!  We're all vibrating now!
<br>
<br>
I knew that already - - everything vibrates at a certain "frequency" - - but I never applied it toward my OBE attempts.  Now I know that all I have to do is FIND THEM.  Go to a certain place in my head where they are very loud and where my body can "feel" them (although I'm paralyzed and technically can't feel a thing).
<br>
<br>
Am I the only one who's had this "revelation?"

The place you are looking for is right on the border of your imagination. That's where the Astral begins. Discovering this was a *major* revelation for me. I used to think of the Astral as some place distant. Like I had to bridge a big load of space to get there. After all, that is what my (then) normal projection process felt like. But the connection was right under my nose all that time.

the tubelike structures are mentioned in ad. they are gateways to the planes. it says that they are probably the same as any other gateway but that people w/ better developed crown or brow centers may experience these type of gateways instead of the straight, level, gridded ones that most other poeple do. i can sometimes see them right before a projection right above my head. it looks as though  i m riding a roller coaster that's caged in from all sides. very cool looking , feeling and sounding.

Greetings Everyone!
<br>
<br>
Interesting thread, and one which is also interesting to compare with the Monroe Gateway thread, because I believe there is an important progression here.
<br>
<br>
As I understand it, Monroe's original work was with "mystical" OBE or Astral projection, and for which he advocated "reaching out for the vibrations" a few inches in front of you, and "pulling them into your body" to trigger the projection reflex.  I have to say as an aside that this does seem to be somewhat counter-intuitive, in that the vibrations are a symptom of the state and not a pre-cursor that exists beyond the body. At the final analysis, the projection reflex is bought about by the exteriorisation of the awareness, which causes the generation and projection of a copy of the etheric body (RTZ) or Astra-Mental body when projecting stratight to the Astral realms.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 However
</b>
: Monroe moved on from that stage and to his immense credit, and recognised the fact that mystical OBE's or "Astral projection" were all very well and good fun etc., but due to memory recall, reality fluctuation, stability and a host of other problems, that not much was being accomplished from the OBE/Astral experience - and there is no doubt in my mind at least that it should be meaningful and part of an ongoing progression. That is when Monroe appears to have focussed latterly on hemi-sync oriented raising of consciousness in-situ to the Astral realms with a much higher degree of reliability, memory recall, objectivity and accordingly value.
<br>
<br>
What I am suggesting is that before embarking on a long program of OBE practice by conventional means, one should ask oneself exactly what it is you are hoping to achieve, and accordingly whether the more controlled Monroe type methods are more appropriate to your real and true objectives.
<br>
<br>
Of course, if all you want to do is to project out of your body and float around your room or next door, and generally visit the etheric reflections of the physical plane (aka RTZ), then OBE's may well be for you.
<br>
<br>
There is a true form of Astral wandering whereby the complete Astra-Mental body leave the physical, and is effectively true temporary death. The physical heart stops, and all bodily functions cease, and the body becomes in a state of suspended animation. The physical body is kept alive via the silver cord, which is actually the "Astral matrix", through which the Astra-Mental body delivers the life force, vital energy to sustain the physical body in that state. If however the physical body is touched in that state, by a human or a pet for example, the Astral Matrix is instantly severed, and physical death results. A post mortem would likely conclude sudden heart failure as the cause of death. True Astral wandering however is a totally controlled experience, which enables interaction with the level of the Astral associated with the level of vibrations of your Astra-Mental body, and of course as the
<b>
 original
</b>
mind was seperated, memory recall is complete.
<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, humanity is and should be headed towards the "raised consciousness" type of Astral work, and which is not limited to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Jeff_M should relate pretty well to this as he describes the blackness in very much the same way. With me, I describe it as taking on a 3D effect. This is the start of the projection process (in more of a modern-day sense).
<br>
<br>
I get: 3D backness, followed by whirls of multi-coloured foggy kind of smoky stuff; couple with the odd outline image or other; which may also be accompanied by the odd sound (this is what I call the "stray energy" stage). Then everything clears and the Astral comes into view; at which point I used to automatically "step into" this image and I'd find myself within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Lately, however, I have been practising just viewing the image as if I were sitting back looking at it on a screen. Which is a process I believe is called: Remote Viewing. With this method, vibration feelings are minimal to none. And if they are present they come across more like a light buzzing. Well, that's how it is with me.
<br>

<br>

Hi Frank and Overworked!
<br>
<br>
Sorry I haven't been around for the last few days.  The 8th was my 27th birthday.  The 9th was my anniversary.....and the 10th kept me pretty occupied with my new online Movie I made for my website.
<br>
<br>
I can't really add to what Frank said.  I too see the blackness before my eyes start to coagulate into dense shapes.  This only happens when I am extremely relaxed AND my normal, day-to-day thoughts are quiet.
<br>
<br>
Like Frank said, if you can passively hold this image, you can use it as an astral doorway to step into.  As for me, I usually fall asleep around this stage (because again, in order to be at this stage, you're already incredibly relaxed).  However, as long as I've properly affirmed my intention to OBE, I usually will wake up sometime later and roll out of my body into the Real Time Zone.
<br>
<br>
Keep trying.  You're almost there, my friend!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>
