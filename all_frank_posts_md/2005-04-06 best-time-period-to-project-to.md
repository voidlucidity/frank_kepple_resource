I am wondering, what is the best era in history to travel to?  I was thinking the roaring 20's or maybe 60's?  Anyone gone to great places based in universes invented? like star wars or lord of the rings?
<br>
<br>
Just need input on where to go for a great experience.

I spent a lot of time trying to get through my wardrobe, convinced I'd end up in Narnia (the fictional world in C S Lewis' "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).  I still haven't managed it.
<br>
<br>
I'm less interested in "time" travel, but I'd love to go into the earth, rather than out into space.  I'd like to see what it feels like to be a leaf on a tree, a flower, a slug, a mole, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, I had an OBE in the middle of a dream yesterday where I became a cat - your normal domestic type - but it was brilliant darting along at speed so close to the ground.  It didn't last long, I was trying to keep up with another cat, but I lost it/him, and that in turn made me lose my experience - boo hoo.
<br>
<br>
If pushed, I'd have to say I wouldn't mind experiencing biblical times, perhaps following Moses to the promised land and watching the Red sea part.

I would personally enjoy going to Atlantis times, but I haven't figured out how to change times just yet...

thanks for the input guys, I am not really able to have too much control over my travels, the last time I projected (my 2nd) I ended up just asking to go places and being taken there, but 2 out of the 3 where not accurate.  I guess dinosaurs would be awesome to see, I have even considered partying with some muppets, that would rock.
