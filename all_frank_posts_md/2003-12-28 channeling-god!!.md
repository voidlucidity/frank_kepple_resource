I have a math problem for god that has never been solved (many have tried):
<br>
<br>
<font color='"green"'>
 You have a set of 1000 numbers.
 <br>
 <br>
 K = some number that is approximately half the sum of the set
 <br>
 <br>
 At most 1000^10 (exponent 10) times: You may compare, add, subtract, or do anything else (that takes a short time) to a number in the set.
 <br>
 <br>
 Find a set of numbers (from the set of 1000) that sums to exactly K.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(This is an approximation of the problem, but the answer will probably be valid for the more complex version if it is solved)

Ok, I don't know loads of information on religion considering I'm only 14. But I do know that the Christian God hasn't been around forever. So my question to you God. Where were you for the couple million years people worshiped the storm clouds and sun gods?

If one of the 1000 numbers is infinite then an exact answer cn not be given.
<br>
Is there a range of valid values for the 1k numbers, or are they arbitrarily chosen? And they are scalar, right?

<br>
<br>
And now my question:
<br>
Dear God, if you exist or not is not something I have an opinion on, but currently, entertaining the idea that you do, I'd like to know sometihing rather important to me. You see, I'm lost and need to know wich direction I should go. So I ask you; which way is the horizon?

 Hello.....God
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes I know
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 .....well what is the answer

<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Well it is in two parts. First what makes people think I am only the God of the Christians
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well are you not
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 no ......I am the God of all flesh
</font>
<br>

 but dont you love the Christians a bit more than the others
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 no, but I know what makes you think that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 you do
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 why
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 becourse thats what they claim. But you see they are a bit spoiled and snooty.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so you are the God of everybody
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes.....and that makes that second question quite unnessesary
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 it does
</font>

<font color='"blue"'>
 I was ..... always
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 millions of years?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 more than that....you humans still believe you are the center of the universe and that everything revolves around you....it does not!!!
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what do you mean

 it revolves around ....ME

 some are some are not

 First you should define GODS. There is only one of ME[

<br>

 so I noticed
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ....and?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 the Horizon is all around, every direction. In the Spiritual it is in even more directions than that

 but which way should he go?

<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 thats not up to me....thats up to HIM
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yes , but he is asking you for advise
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 and I am giving it to him
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but you did not say where to go and he is lost
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I want him to use his own mind....thats why I gave it to him
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so you cant be more specific
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I can tell him what I would like him to do, but he does not have to do it
</font>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 thats fine
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  follow after LOVE, pray to me and I will lead him....with a still small voice , if he really wants to find my will for his life,he must have no will of your own but have faith in me[/blue]

<section>
Ooo... Good answer.
<br>
However, I must admit I suspected as much.
<br>
<br>
But I won't pray. I am I. Not only do I have a mind, but I have a free will of my own.
<br>
<br>
Notes:
<br>
- My mind won't tell me where to go. I've tried that. (You won't fool me again. =p)
<br>
- Will is free because will is none. Like a vessel waiting to be filled.
<br>
- My will being free I'll end up wherever it may be. (Read signature.)
<br>
- Given the choise, I'd opt for a pair of wings and blue skies. =)
<br>
- As long as I continue walking I'll eventually end up at my goal.

Hmmm, sounds like a familiar inner dialogue - I believe I recognize that Voice! [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
Ceriel ... that's the very beauty of God, and the answer to your question! Your free will and mind is a gift from God who does not violate you. The answer is within you, yet you cannot, or will not, access it because you refuse to listen! You seem to be setting up a conflict that does not exist.
<br>
<br>
I was afraid to "lose" myself, yet when I let go of my "freedom" and self-will, I found, much to my astonishment, true freedom within, real life welling up, and my true self breaking out of the shell of falsehood that had me bound! This is what Jesus meant when He said (paraphrased), "the one who tries to save his life will lose it, but the one who loses his life for My sake will gain it," or "in order for a seed to grow and bear fruit, it must fall to the ground and die."
<br>
<br>
So, I pray, and I AM I in that Great I AM. I am no puppet for God, because he is not a puppeteer. To make Him one is simply to reduce that which is the Highest Good to a projection of our own selfishness and fear.
<br>
<br>
And He says to tell you He loves you and that you too, if you listen within, will hear that Voice of Love, the inner voice of God.

I asked that question for 2 reasons:
<br>
<br>
(1) If it was solved, some things done on computers that would take longer than the known universe has existed to finish, could finish in 1 minute. The fastest way known to solve that problem takes between about 1000^100 to 1000^1000 time, not 1000^10 or less, but it is suspected that it can be done, and has never been proven that it cant. If the size of the set increased by 1, it would take 100-1000 times longer to solve, using current methods.
<br>
<br>
(2) To test the intelligence of who Mustardseed was talking to (if anybody), not to test if it was god, because even if the correct answer is given, that does not prove it was god, only that its IQ is over 200.
<br>
<br>
I know now that who you were talking to is not god because it said
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 He was asking.....are you real....and I answered.....I AM
</font>
instead of saying these 2 reasons.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ceriel N
<font color='"blue"'>
 If one of the 1000 numbers is infinite then an exact answer cn not be given. Is there a range of valid values for the 1k numbers, or are they arbitrarily chosen? And they are scalar, right?
</font>
<br>
<br>
They can be any finite number.
<br>
<br>
That was an approximation to a more complex problem, which I will describe more of here:
<br>
<br>
It must be solvable using the same method for ANY positive size (S) set of numbers. The time it takes to solve must be less than S^N, for any constant N. Current methods of solving take time proportional to N^S, which is very slow. This sounds easy since you can choose any N, but (N^S &gt; S^N) will happen relatively fast as S increases, for any value of N.
<br>
<br>
It must be solvable for any number K. I gave the hardest K to solve for, one where about half the numbers would have to be used. It is also valid to determine there is no subset of numbers that sums to K. The answer (method of choosing the subset) must find the subset if it exists, or determine there is no valid subset.
<br>
<br>
This problem is one of many problems that are all called NP-Complete. They can all be converted to each other in a short time. If one is solved, they will all be solved.

Yeah, it does mean something, but it's not conclusive. The information needed to generate and direct the sentence is easily obtainable, in fact readily availible, and all it requires is a little smarts. The question is, why would someone with smarts want to do it? No, I'd say this weights _against_ credability rather than for it. Besides the readily availible information there's more behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>
MS, if you are pulling a prank, please stop. If not, ask for a second opinion and someone to verify. Things are often not what they appear to be, and lies are abundant.

It has many uses. One is searching more moves ahead in chess. If it were solved, enough moves could be searched ahead that when the first move was made, the computer might say "checkmate in 147". It allows many problems to be solved by solving only a few problems.

Mustardseed,
<br>
<br>
First off I'd like to thank Al Gore for installing Internet access in middle schools across the states so Mustardseed could bring us these revolutions.
<br>
<br>
Please have a permanent Out-of-Body experience. I could have a more meaningful conversation with a plant, albeit not a legal plant but none the less.
<br>
<br>
The only thing you are accomplishing is wasting space on the Astral Pulse server. Also you may be confusing younger or more gullable readers. However, more sensible readers will realize that you are a joke, like your posts.
<br>
<br>
If you were on fire I would not urinate on your burning body, lest to suppress the smell of your burning flesh.
<br>
<br>
I suppose I'm angry at the fact that you constantly quote the Bible and claim to be Christian, yet your actions now fail to reflect this. You have become a rambling buffoon bent on your own soul's self destruction. You are making a mockery of a subject that is already seen by the majority of a society as false, I tried to get across this point by creating the post "CHANNELING SATAN".
<br>
<br>
It is apparent that you have no training as a medium and it is against Christianities fundamental beliefs. If you are just joking around you are making false statements about God's word. If you are truly insane I apologize.
<br>
<br>
Please rethink what you are doing, I suggest doing this while playing hopscotch in the middle of traffic.
<br>
<br>
One might say the following to describe you:
<br>
<br>
A few screws short of a hardware store.
<br>
The antenna doesn't pick up all the channels.
<br>
Would argue with a signpost.
<br>
Etc.
<br>
<br>
In short I think your soul may need a few more incarnations to get everything going in the old mind. Or perhaps you need to change (or start taking) your medication.

<section>
Well, just a slight technicality ... he said "God of all flesh," not "the god of the flesh."
<br>
<br>
In typical biblical parlance, a "god of the flesh" is an idol of selfish desire, like making the desire for power or sex or money one's god, or ruling principle. Thus, were one to personify all of the "gods of the flesh" into a single archtypal entity, that would indeed be the commonly refered to "Satan" or Devil. (Of course, at this point, one might easily digress into a discussion of the Christian concept of Satan and the Jewish concept of Satan or HShTN...)
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, "the God of all flesh" is a biblical phrase from Jeremiah used to indicate the one God who is sovereign over all creation and creatures.
<br>
<br>
Carry on ...

 yes it is quite common for people to get really that upset at anyone who claims a closer relationship to me than they have themself.

  so I noticed
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  ....and?
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  the Horizon is all around, every direction. In the Spiritual it is in even more directions than that
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  but which way should he go?
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  thats not up to me....thats up to HIM
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  yes , but he is asking you for advise
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  and I am giving it to him
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  but you did not say where to go and he is lost
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  I want him to use his own mind....thats why I gave it to him
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  so you cant be more specific
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  I can tell him what I would like him to do, but he does not have to do it
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  thats fine
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  follow after LOVE, pray to me and I will lead him....with a still small voice , if he really wants to find my will for his life,he must have no will of your own but have faith in me
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  thanks I will tell him
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  thanks
 </font>
</b>
<br>

3rd question:  How old are you?
<br>
<br>

i cannot verify whether ms is talking to God, but i can second that God has a purpose with this thread. the purpose is for one or two people, not the majority (and those people who it is for are not neccessarily going to post), and if you don't like it you don't have to read it (remember that whole "free will" thing? [|)]).
<br>
<br>
something i CAN say though, is that you people are very centered on such stupid things (for the most part). try asking questions that would help you understand things (like steel hawk's question, "why?"), rather than just trying to trip up mustardseed.

One more Question for God lol and do alot of concentrated channeling for this one(I'm not being sarcastic, think of it as a 'person' doing some kind of math question for yea, but I'm more open minded, and have a sense of humour also).
<br>
<br>
With the best description, answer, or comment you can with this question; How come when someone is suppose to follow and learn the 'faith' of God(concerning if there knowledge of religion at the time is low i.e Me), And even people at the church say it is good to ask questions, and God wishes for every people to be wise, blah blah, why, why is it that the church(the church i went to for my first time btw) which was over 45 minutes away from me wont let me back at there church? well off the record (lol but you knew already) they say(pasture), "Theres nothing here for you."  and I am not accepted. people at the church and even the cow speaching tongues  people hate me for me just trying to find something lol. answer that, if you cant answer, try to explain in a broad detail about it, lol or comment, ORRR if you a awesome God, answer, explain, and comment all at once

I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, by taking him seriously. I believe that most people are honest and generally good when they can be.
<br>

After listened to MS further on I realized he is a sick person in one way or another. [xx(] Unless, he truely is channeling God. But that seems highly unlikely.

Persecution, ridicule, being shut off and loosing friends and family, thats just the beginning. The reason is that people get afraid when you ask question. It means that there could be more than one way to answer and that they could be wrong.Suffering in various forms comes with the territory, and should be expected

<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but why did you not help him or send someone or something
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I did
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 he says you didn't
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ha...he does not see things as I do. He met lots of good people, some helped him and some did not, thats free will. He was also helped from the other side, I stirred his heart, all in all he is doing better now that he has confronted the dragon
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 he sounds discouraged, and they shut him out of the Church
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 tell him I sympathise and understand, they dont want me in there either, and I have been trying to get in for a long time
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what about the math
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I dont do math
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but...
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I told them that allready.....no testing . Believe in me or do not believe in me.
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  anything else
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  tell him to be more selective. He is in a big muddle becourse he is using his head to sort things out, tell him to take more time to be still. To listen for the still small voice. Sometimes he gets all in a big fuzz over things and all in confusion. I am not the one who sends confusion.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  you don't mean...
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  yes ofcourse. The enemy. Everytime someone attempts to get in touch with me and find my will in his or her life, answers to questions, the confusion and shelling starts. Its like the old trench warfare, the enemy does not start shooting till you go over the top and come at him. In the spirit it is the same
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  so can you sum it up
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  no
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  what....
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  if you want to you can sum it up.....I did my part. Oh by the way tell him to stay sweet and kind, and not use the enemys power, it will just mess things up in his life. It looks like it will work, but really dosn't. You know..... anger, resentment, hate, and also to try to control himself, he is a bit of a loose cannon..... Nice kid tho.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  well ...ok thanks

<br>
<br>
3) How come your not on Television like Larry King Live or something? instead of internet? lol you know larry king got james van praagh super famous, and you know noone believes in mediums

4) I dare not say this in a church, or i meen ask this, but
<i>
 is there some reletively truths and similarities between the muslim religion and the chriustian religion?
</i>
i.e muslims talk about the spiritual development which is 90% similar with OBE' AP'ing and Ki and all that! and on the christian side, Jesus IS the Son of God, when the muslims believe EVERYTHING with jesus, and even to come back to fight the beast but for some reason 'do not' believe he was our savior, you understand? both are VERY similar but both sides have truths that are not in eachothers books

Yes : God has a purpose with this thread.
<br>
<br>
Hi Mustardseed, I have a question for God. I plead with you that MY question is treated in priority. The questions from the guy upstairs are not that interesting, you'll agree with me. Similarities between islam and christianity..? hello ?! They have the same roots !
<br>
<br>
Ok now, my question :
<br>
<br>
Has John Gardner the novelist reincarnated yet ? I would like to channel him in another thread. He died in a motorcycle accident. Well, let's cut the chase : is it POSSIBLE to channel him right now ?
<br>
And if so, do you think he would oblige if I were the one to channel him ? I have no channeling experience, but one can learn it in about an hour or less, according to what I gathered from the Pleiadians and Zetas 'communications'.
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.
<br>
<br>
ps : I know that you God cut all communication with me, and I respect that. I don't know the reasons, but I am sure they are legitimate. I don't resent you anymore - but you know that !
<br>
Still thanks for your protection and invisible guidance.

  are they real

  absolutely but not the way they are made up to be real

  most think of them as a sort of unreal place where the decieved are kept till they figure out reality

  ok listen up. The terretories you talk about is part of heaven as You call it. It is all MY terretory. It is all where you go after you have lived your life in your dimension. It is divided according to vibrations. It is actually not vibrations but more the sounds of the spirit, but thats for another time. As people let me into their life their ability to precieve the vibration or hear my voice changes and they are able to see further.
  <font color='"blue"'>

Mildly interesting thread. The one thing I could not help commenting upon with this 'questioning God' theme... the people who posted questions as they were encouraged to by MS under the support of "God" are getting the same cryptic answers. Simply put "No, I'm not answering that how you want me to... but here's a nonsensical answer for you to brood over."
<br>
<br>
I have no intentions of telling anyone "You're nuts!"... but more over, I wanted to inspire an idea for some people. (This is not a divine idea either, just a common one) "Think a little".
<br>
<br>
I have doubts that an omnipotent being would decide to start a conversation to seemingly say "Yep, I'm God, but don't distrust that I am God, because I will not answer you truthfully to prove otherwise... just to prove I am in fact confident that I'm God."
<br>
<br>
This is circle logic.
<br>
<br>
What I'm really saying is, I don't think anyone is getting anything out of this thread, and seeing as how nothing has been achieved by it yet, I doubt any good will be had from it. Just wanted any newcommers to know that not everyone supports all of the ideas on here. Sometimes somone needs to step up and just say "That's a little far fetched."
<br>
<br>
I think it would do us good to maintain a bit of credibility in these conversations and to approach things with an open mind, but as well as exercise some common sense. Perhaps MS really is speaking to some entity, but who is to know if it is in fact "The God". I think this should all be taken with a grain of salt.
<br>
<br>
MS: Please don't bother to consult with the creator on this one. If 'God' wishes to address me on what I've said, he knows where to reach me. Getting an answer through your medium talent would just validate my suspicion that this 'God' had no realm outside of the confines of your own person.
<br>
<br>
I hope this doesn't come across as too harsh, that's not my intent.
<br>
<br>
Blessed Be [

Hi Necro, you don't get it. I think that God is partly making fun of Pleiadians and Zetas communications : those other 'guys' (who have no materiality) aren't allowing any 'testing' either. But this thread is actually interesting, and IS inspired by God. I trust that because I know Mustardseed very well - maybe more than he does himself, in some regards. He is a clear enough channel, in my opinion. I should say more, but I am still currently investigating something (or someone..). Let's just say that all nuts are not sealed-packaged.
<br>
<br>
Hey God, thanks for your answers about John Gardner.
<br>
<br>
Another quicky : that idiot Walsh was not talking to you, was he? (the author responsible for the 'conversations with God' waste of trees).
<br>
<br>
ps1 : God is the God of all flesh. Flesh without God is no longer flesh : it becomes a fertilizer. Aristotle made an artificial dissection of the body and soul. But think about it : we use our brain to think and feel, and what does make your heard beat ? The body is the 'form' of the soul before we die. And once we are dead, there is no more body, no more thinking brain, no more heart beat, and the soul has another form, which I am not familiar with.
<br>
<br>
ps2 : God said it, no ? He's also the God of muslims.
<br>
<br>
Anoher quicky : God what do you think of Mayatnik and his society-is-out-to-get-us fixation ?

<section>
faith is a steadfast belief in something that has not been proven or disproven.
<br>
<br>
you are right in that faith is a fool's friend, but only if there is proof/evidence to show why the belief is wrong. since there is no proof to either prove God's existance or disprove it, anyone who cares either way is working on belief (this includes the scientists who *believe* there is no God as well as the religious/spiritual types who *believe* there is. note that no side has any actual proof with which to convince the other side).
<br>
<br>
some people are more assured in their beliefs and will continue to actively trust in them (until proven wrong) whereas others tend to be trendy and drop what they believe to follow every new idea that comes along (regardless of truth behind it). the idea of faith is that you choose to believe something even if other people come along and tell you it's wrong without *proving* it's wrong. a truly intelligent person will understand that they have faith as well as intelligence in their lives (and not just faith as in religious faith, even faith in science or faith in other people's abilities).
<br>
<br>
if God truly wanted to prove He existed, He could prove it in a way that none of us could ever deny, but that's not His purpose. the purpose of having faith in God (steadfast trust in believing He exists) is to seperate the wanna-be's from those who truly do seek Him. those with actual faith in God will be shown proof at the time when they finally figure out they don't need it (seems paradoxical, but that's the way it goes).
<br>
<br>
as to why God might do that: hell, if I were God i'd do things like that all the time just to mess with people's heads [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]. He has His own reasons, though, and even if i don't know them i still trust in Him.
<br>
<br>
faith is the first step, proof comes later.
<br>
<br>
so for those who come onto this thread and just say MS is not channeling God (in whatever subtle way they say it), they are also merely presenting a belief.
<br>

 I am back God

<font color='"blue"'>
 Yes Mustardseed.....I know
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I am ready to ask, I have a few more questions
</font>
<br>
[
<font color='"blue"'>
 ok shoot
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I am very interested in the thing you mentioned about age
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes it is a very facinating subject isn't it?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so would you mind explaining
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I would rather you ask, I sort of like that and it makes it easy for people to understand me and maybe they will start to talk to me as well, but ....allright
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 thanks
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Ok, Age let me explain it as simple as I can[
 <img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
 ]
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 OK
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 age in your dimension is meassured in years, right
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 how long you have lived, yes?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 in the eternal now, time does nolonger exist..... as you know it, that is
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 how is that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 there is continuity, but it is open ended, and can be streched and shrunk
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I dont understand that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it is one of the hardest things to understand becourse you are a creature of time, and it actually has to be felt with the spirit, more than understood with the mind. Time is tied to the physical dimension, but after the physical turns to the spiritual, time also changes to the with it. It keeps certain of the elements that you know on earth, but becomes more transparent and negrotiable. Since it is nolonger tied to the physical, and since you can travel between the different levels of the spirit instantly, you can learn to negrotiate and bend time.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 you mean timetravel
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 more than that....you can actually create time, that was not!!
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 wow
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 in the spirit world, as the physical world recede, the qualities of the spirit come to the forefront, and other dimensions are  added.....With motivation, and desire you create another parameter for time as well as add on or detract from your existance.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I am compleately lost here flopped out of highschool....as you know
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 if you believe all things are possible, time in time becomes ....what you make it, as does many other things on the other side
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 you mean we have to learn to trancend time?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Yes, as you first arrive you bring time with you in a way, but as you become more and more aware of ME and comes to understand how it all fits you will also begin to learn to bend time and time itself becomes just another dimension, that you can work with. Though some insist in staying in time even here. That happens often in certain sectors of heaven
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so I could eat the same cake over and over
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 believe me, you would not want to. As you grow in this understanding, you also grow in faith and maturity, and you become more acutely aware of my plan for your life and the lives of those around you, and as you start your work, you learn to handle this responsibility
 <font color='"blue"'>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   work....I thought it was gonna be free time and rest and stuf
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   for some it will be , but for a time, and after that your real life begins and you will be given your assignments
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   Ok interesting . So then why do you call Robert Bruce a kid
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   becourse in my presence, and in this dimension he is. You all are, some are a bit further ahead and there are the real A students but generally you are all in school
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   what makes someone a A student in this life then?
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   their ability to LOVE... LOVING others is, becoming a instrument of my Spirit, becourse I AM.....LOVE
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   so it has nothing to do with ability to project
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   not very much projecting is sort of like PE or gymnastics of the spirit or astral, purely the ability to control ones etheric body the spirit and ones surroundings, it is purely motor skills. Maturity is something very different. It doesn't matter if you have faith to move mountains, knowledge of the deep spiritual mysteries or if you sacrefice everyday burn insence , or if you give your life in religious or social service, without LOVE it is like scraps of paper and it will all be burned away, for though I am LOVE I am also a purifying fire. All that stands in the end is how much you Loved how much you listened to me and let me work through you
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   wow, that sort of sends a message to us all I suppose
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   yes
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   I kind of knew this but it is good to have it repeated that way
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   glad you like my words,
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   ok I gotta go sleep thangs again and ......I pray you keep me through the night

We dont have highschool where I was raised but I sort of "flubbed out of the eqivilent" 10grade. By flobbed I did not mean fluked or flunked but just barely made it by the skin of my teeth with very bad grades. Those were the hippi days we had more important things to do then[

Hello,
<br>
<br>
I have some questions here lol yet to be answered(I'll word it differently I suppose) lol. keep you busy with questions, while at the same time tinkling people off hah.
<br>
<br>
1) Are we going to be confronted with other 'alien' species here in the next 10 years?
<br>
<br>
2) Are people really channeling other species?
<br>
<br>
3) As detailed as possible, how can one train himself to channel with 'You', Other Spirits, Species ect,(if possible) without saying something like "got to accept me within you" lol or anything like that, OK i suppose the quesiton is, "
<b>
 do people train to learn how to channel like people learn to AP?"
</b>
<br>
<br>
4) How do you know when your spiritually Developing?
<br>
<br>
5) I read this book, "A Divine Revelation of the Spirit World" by Mary Baxter, She claimed in the book she Channeled and saw, walked around with jesus(she Astral Projected), in the book it said this:
<br>
<i>
 "But God told me, 'I am going to reveal to you the reality of Hell.  I will show you these things so that many may be saved and many can repent of there evil ways before it is too late.'"
 <br>
 He continued solemnly, "Your soul will be taken out of your body by Me, The Lord Jesus Christ.  You will be conveyed supernaturally into hell and to other places in the spirit realm.  You will be able to see things that you cannot see in the natural realm, but these are the things I want you to see."
</i>
<br>
So the question is I suppose, was this lady channeling with Jesus Christ, and in the astral planes with him also?
<br>
<br>
6) Is it possible to see Jesus Christ in the astral Realm?

Steel Hawk, I'm not sure what the problem with you and this thread is about, if its a Childhood Problem or Daddy wouldnt stop drinking, but Don't reply to this thread nomore, because its making you upset and recalling childhood memories.  Just let the past go.
<br>
<br>
Your a very Self-Thinking kind of guy, what you say is the right. what others say depends on your judgement.  Sorry to say, thats wrong.  People wont just stop what they 'believe' in (faith) because 'You' Say its wrong.
<br>
<br>
Now another thing, you think your proving something on this thread by making arrogant stupid comments?  why dont you go to a different thread, you have done enough whining here.  Now im not gonna bust yea out and then say something nice like, 'But your a nice guy though'. No, i dont know you, and so far, Im thinking your a pretty arrogant kinda guy, so I'm just gonna bust yea out.

Hi Kerrblur
<br>
I hope you have had a good newyear so far[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
]. I read your questions with interest and would like to direct you to the thread I set up about Channeling. Can't remember what I named it. I would like to hear your own opinion on these questions. About my channeling experience or whatever we call it I have a few comments.
<br>
<br>
What I do is this. I simply sit down and ....... write. I never think a lot about what I write nor do I make big changes. My spelling is sometimes off so I do often go back and correct that, but I have on this thread frequently been very suprised at what I have seen appear on the screen. Wether I am channeling God or not is a question I am also asking myself. I would say that for me .....I believe it is God or His Spirit speaking, however I am not saying that God is "upthere" as a man sitting looking down in much the same way as I am on my keyboard. I believe thet HE inspires the writing and that His Spirit empowers and "translates" the wisdom He has and want to share with me into a sort of, play, or charade. A bit like a visual or audio story , but containing the very truths that he wants to share with me.
<br>
<br>
In my "universe" God is a loving father type figure , an everforgiving and patient mentor, older brother, mate and a trusted friend. The God I see in the Bible, wants and desires contact with me as well as you and everyone else. He possesses emotions, has likes dislikes and a standard of behaviour, right and wrong is important to him and He is much closer through Jesus to humanity, than the "cosmos type of far away allpowerfull but unpersonal diety" that others on the board believes him to be. This is my opinion. I do not feel that this Channeling/prophecy is in contradiction to the Bible but in addition.
<br>
<br>
This is really IMO what Channeling/prophecy is all about. The ability and desire to just sit and talk to God, no big holabaloo and a marching band. I have done this for many years and it has brought me comfort and answers in very complex situations. It has given me patience when I have been all worked up and rest when I have felt flustered stressed and I will continue to do this. I have decided to open up my world and how I live think and act, in this thread and apologise to anyone for any harm it does to their faith or lack of same. That is not the intent. It is a truth that whenever anyone of us tries to do something positive we will all face opposition, we will all have our Sanhedrin counsil our judas but nevertheless, I believe this is just to make us stronger. You yourself has had this experience and it has made you a different person. Life is a funny buissness . As we grow older some get better some get bitter. My advise is to stay open and talk to Him yourself. He said that if any one that comes to him he will never cast out. I wish you the best and will get to your questions in my next post.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

This thread is nothing if not interesting!
<br>
<br>
I like your results Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
I have tried a bit of channeling on and off over the past couple of years, using a similar method to yours, with some interesting results.
<br>
Sometimes it seems 'only' to be an inner dialogue that I am conversing with, but sometimes something suprising comes through which throws that assumption. Some critics are too hasty to dismiss it as 'just inner dialogue'.
<br>
<br>
IMO 'inner dialogue' is a means by which your subconscious mind can talk to you (and you to it). This is very useful. What is even more useful is that IMO the subconscious mind is ALSO the bridge between your mind and the astral (and other higher regions); its where the two meet. Therefor I believe that higher powers can communicate to you via your subconscious, whether in dreams, visions, or direct channeling as you describe.
<br>
<br>
These higher powers may include God, the Gods, or some part of the cosmic heirarchy (I suppose we all have our own views on which, but they all add up to 'the divine'); I think it does work however; I suppose that it takes experience to establish what is coming from you and what comes 'from above'. As I said, the two seem to be closely linked.
<br>
<br>
you have great results so far Mustardseed. It sounds like you have established an easygoing communication method.
<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work!
<br>
<br>
Douglas

   yes it does its a part of the picture but often leaves out key elements or adds others that were not in accordance with me. Elements of pride either pride in man strong elements of self will self effort and the praise of man and comercialism

  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   ok then to the alien thing are there other worlds inhabited out there
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"blue"'>
   Ok now here is the deal. YOU DECIDE. what do you want to believe. I can give you a few hints but again it is up to you to make the desision what to believe. The reason I put it this way is that any choice you make could influence the way you decide to live your life and I have committed myself to only partly interfere so as to not push you around. This is how I will put it. After life here there will be lots to do. All on earth will get to know me . That is all who have lived lives and will live, and after that there is more work still to be done.

    but are they channeling reptiles and pleideans and stuf and are we gonna have a alien invasion
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"blue"'>
    ok ......I gotta level with you about that one . No reptiles and no Pleiadeans but...they are talking to someone allright!!!
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"red"'>
    who is it they are talking to
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"blue"'>
    its entities who deny my existance. Think about that
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"red"'>
    ohhh I see
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"blue"'>
    yep its just as easy to hear from them as it is to hear from me
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"red"'>
    how do we know the difference
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"blue"'>
    what a mans heart is full of will overflow in his life. Like attracts like as you say. If you desire the world to be of no importance and your life to be insignificant, becourse you are failing in life, and you do not want to try very much to change things, or if you are constantly looking for things  that indicate that YOU are special and a chosen one.....both extremes bearing strong aspects of pride  you will chose voices that bolster your own preconcieved ideas of how things are. Pride is at the root of every channeling that has dipped into the lower parts.
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"red"'>
    so they are bad spirits
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"blue"'>
    some are but remember your own spirit actually becomes a bad spirit in rebellion, and some are just like that
   </font>
   <br>
   <font color='"red"'>
    so can this happen to Christians too
   </font>
   <br>
   <span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
    ofcourse they can be some of the most screwed up becourse of their Pride in their faith and they say and do things that I never told them to say and do, I am no respecter of persons and groups or churches. I see each of you as individuals
   </span>
  </font>
  <br>
  <font color='"red"'>
   last question for now can one see Jesus in the Astral
  </font>
  <br>
  <span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
   yes but not all do, for even demons and lesser beings can apperar as angels of light. Some have seen that part of me but some have been decieved as well

Hello,
<br>
<br>
Hey, with my other question yet to be answered still yet to be answered, I have another question to add for the Answer that was given about the 'alien' 'entitie spirits' that people are channeling,  You/God said:
<br>
____________________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 who is it they are talking to
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 its entities who deny my existance. Think about that
</font>
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
In the Chanelling about the 'Zetas' They claim to believe in God in the fullest, they also claim that they believe you have to have Love with God, (you know all that).  I'm not doubting but just, a person like myself can't answer question by himself without some help, so I have to add(to help answer myself)
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Doesnt God perceive himself in different ways?
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Same could be true to beings not of this world?
</b>
<br>
<br>
(like christians, muslims, two different gods, but perceived in different ways ect.)

you are correct theseeker. this kind of "danger" is present in ALL channeling attempts though, not just those with God (ie, your quote is valid for the channeling palaedians, reptile, zeta, etc threads too).
<br>
<br>
and besides, anyone can be wrong. mustardseed is trying this as an experiment. i've seen nothing from him saying that we all have to believe this is from God or we are all going to burn in hell for an eternity, or anything like that. so believe it if you will, or don't if you don't *shrug* that's up to you and everyone else reading this thread to decide *for themself*.
<br>
<br>
my personal opinion is also that mustardseed is channeling his higherself (or some part or his own mind), but that is my own opinion and not to be confused with truth (although, since we don't *know* if/what mustardseed is really channeling, we can't exactly decide what is *true*, now can we ^_^ )

hey,
<br>
<br>
Well, my comments about this thread, at first I thought it was hillarious when i started reading it because I was like ' HAH he's mkaeing fun of these reptillians and ZETAS, lol all this ya hoo.
<br>
<br>
Then I'm asking questions to see what kind of response I get form MS, when you guys say Higher Self, (MS can answer this too),
<b>
 could it be (now think before you say you answer), possibly it is the higher consciousness, but when you say "God is in all of us" could it be the
 <i>
  'higher self'
 </i>
 is the area in all of us that 'God' operates in?
</b>
I have nothing to back this on, just a random thought that just came up for no reason lol.
<br>
<br>
And plus TheSeeker, when you say:

<section>
Maybe it would be a good thing to define our discussion. It seems that from what I gather, the term you use for "higher self' is the term I use for God. As an example RB was in the bush ,and recieved help from his Higher self, (and I believe God came to his aid). It may be just terminology but could be offensive, as some people may not want to recognize God as a reality, and others do no want to believe that they have a higher self. I personbally believe in God as you know. I believe that as I strive to be like Christ, He lives in me. This concept is quite easily supported in the scriptures for any fundies who have questions. I believe He is my consiousness so to speak and he may be what you term "higher self".
<br>
<br>
There are many points that I would like to share about Channeling(which I call Prophesying according to Christian terminology) and as someone wisely said I do not expect a single soul to adhere to or even believe in what I channel. If it resonnates and if it is helpful go ahead but if it does not relax, I ain't gonna bash you over the head with it.
<br>
<br>
I have a hard time understanding the offense that Steel Hawk and Seeker and maybe others have taken to this thread. I might be able to understand it if they were fundies, but seeing they are not it is strange to me that they care. Unless they are "closet fundies" [

]Any coment would be appreciated from you two without the abuse please[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
].
<br>
<br>
At any rate I think I will just keep going and let you get a brief glimse of my life, Prophesy is a very big part of it but if noone is interested let me know and I will desist if it bothers the majority.
<br>
<br>
For the future I am considering another style. More like spirit writing as it is called by some. The typing of red and Blue is very laborious for me and for the future I will just let Blue speak[

Hi Chill
<br>
Its a one take thing and below is what I got for you for the first part of your questions. Will try again later
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<span id="hl" style="background-color: yellow">
 CHANNELING GOD
</span>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Words are real things and have an effect. Words create deeds and deeds create in turn other deeds and more thoughts. Real things!. Words lift up or the knock down they curse or they damn. As an man thinks in heart so is he, for out of the soul of a man will spring forth a fountain of either blessed or cursed words and deeds. affirmations are similar, in nature as they are thoughts and if made resillient by repeittion become more and more real in the astral/spiritual and as they become real there they are able to influence life here.
 <br>
 <br>
 This is why FAITH in me is such a strenght and why nothing can stop the man of faith. It is important to learn certain principles in this life, to understand and be able to tap my source of its lifegiving flow. It is good to dwell on the positive in all things be a light and uplifter a joy and a force for good. The more a human mind dwells in my Spirit and seeks oneness with me the more it will become like me as my spirit flows in in all its force. It is what you call a vaccum, but at the same time not all on earth desire this love and my spirit and the answers I give. My weapons of spiritual warfare is humility, selflessness, kindness, suffering and contrary to the world and its pride of life pride of speech and oppulence and luxory, to gain my strenght you must become weak.
 <br>
 <br>
 So....you are what you think, your thoughts determine your life and you become the person you wanna be and some choose me and some choose themselves.
 <br>
 <br>
 It is Good to always include Me in your prayers and desires, saying: "nevertheless your will be done not mine". Some do this and by doing so commit themselves to My plan for their lives, and believe me, what I have in store for each one who loves and follows me is far better than what they could have figured out and gained on their own. In answering prayers other principles come into play. Think of it this way. When you pray its like playing a game of billards. There is the guy with the cue, the numbered balls the red or white and then the pockets. For a prayer to be answered several things have to be lined up in relation to each other. The posision of the balls in relation to the pockets as well as the direction and force of the cueshot. This is why prayers like "oh Lord won't you give me a Mercedes benz" are often not answered. This also goes for lotteries etc. All these desires is of this life and often is not good for the ones asking, so they ask according to their lust and thereby ask amiss. If any of you want to ask anything of me ask for spiritual gifts to aid others, the gifts of love to heal and the gifts of dicernment to be forearmed and vigilant and if asked in a right spirit I will surely answer such a prayer. I am more willing to give than you are to recieve.

Hi Chill
<br>
My impression was, that this is the way it should be understood.
<br>
<br>
affirmations are similar in (their) nature, as they are thoughts (as well) and if made resillient by repeittion become more and more real in the astral/spiritual and as they become real there they are able to influence life here.
<br>
<br>
It would be along the line of fear a fear and it will come opun you, and why Faith is such a good antidote.

Thank you.
<br>
<br>
But just to be clear...
<br>
<br>
Are prayers JUST like affirmations ?
<br>
<br>
You said that when we talk to you God, you listen. You listen to all of us when we talk to you, whoever we are, all the time, although this is hard to understand for us.
<br>
<br>
Do you mean that you listen to affirmations as well ? Are affirmations just like prayers ? If not, how are they different ?
<br>
<br>
God used the pool analogy. Do numbered balls, and the white and the red, represent other people ?
<br>
<br>
Is there such a thing as spiritual warfare between spirits that serve God and the ones who don't ? Are they fighting between themselves, or are they competing in terms of their 'effects' on the Earth ?
<br>
<br>
What's a deed ?
<br>
<br>
Sounds stupid what I am asking. There are stupid questions, bu no stupid answers from God.

<font color='"red"'>
 I have a few more questions from Chill[/red
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  I was wondering when you would get around to it
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  so whats the difference
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  let me explain it so you can understand. A thought grows or ceases to grow depending on the nurishment it gets. Affirmations start like thoughts and their ability to influence grows in much the same way. Like the saying "nursing a grudge". Prayer however is already full grown and is a mature thoughtform with life of its own. It goes places and does stuf, and by the way curses are much the same. Prayers are spiritual power and used and harnessed by my angels and helpers, it is like a vehicle they can use to travel in and effect changes for good.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  ok how about you, do you listen all the time
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  I not only listen I scope the heart I see your very thoughts and the intent of your heart and I discern your motives. I listen to all that you say think and ponder and if you seek me I will often answer you before you have spoken. This is the mystery of faith.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  How about the balls in the analogy are they people
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  yes they are people. Not all prayers are answered some becourse the timing is off some becourse there is no allignment of my will and the prayer itself, and some becourse not enough force is put in the shot. Prayers are answered with the same intensity they are prayed, and yet it is not a work of the flesh but an allignment of my spirit and the one who prays. In prayer we become one.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  Is there a war in the spiritual realm
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  yes there is a war for the minds hearts and souls of men, but the real battle is on earth. Power is released on either side by the desisions that are made here. Whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and what you bind there will be bound here. The enemy have been given a realm and have amassed his forces and he fights desperately for he knows his time is short. He is finite and only able to be in one place at a time and though he has many fighting for him he cannot win.

 <br>

  Wow thanks. Glad you are really that big. Chill a deed is something you do. A done deed.Good deeds and bad deeds. Hope this answers your questions

Hmmm I have some questions:
<br>
<br>
1) What is Karma?  and why is it Christians(sp?) do not believe in karma? well some of them I talk too.
<br>
<br>
2) What if I created a Post called "CHANNELING MYSELF!!!!!" would people give me crap because they feel they need to criminate something?
<br>
<br>
3) Tell me something about the holy ghost? is the holy ghost our higher self? which the holy ghost IS GOD (god, jesus, Holy ghost) trinity thing, you understand? god channels through us through our higher self, which nis the holy spirit?

 There are some questions about lottery numbers and Kerrblur had a few too. Here are the lottery numbers first 2-12-17-23-24-34-10 that is for the 7th.Didn't feel I needed God for that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Good thinking .... those are the numbers!! See you gotta help yourself and use your own mind
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ahhemmm ok well.... next Kerrblur
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Karma....a big question for many. Like most falsehoods it has a element of truth. Most arrows that pierce mans heart is tipped with the truth. It is true that in your world and in the one to come you reap what you sow, this is in a way a Karmic principle, however there exist a further dimension. My laws could be called Karmic, as could every law of nature BUT.....there is more to my mercy than first meets the eye. I scope the heart and my righteousness is compleate and just. I judge not as man judges. My mercy is from everlasting to everlasting and I know the weakness of the flesh. I trancend Karma and in my love do whats right. My mercy covers the bloodstains in the snow and I make the wounds heal. It is not that the stains were never there but I send new snow and cover them , my love will cover a multitude of sins
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 very .....mysterious
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes.....I am sort of into that!!
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what if he channels himself
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 that would be called....writing down his opinion, and depending on that , his opinion, folks would react accordingly
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what about the HOLY SPIRIT
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 It is my Spirit, the spirit of LOVE which empowers my people to Love others, it brings things to their rememberence, warns of dangers and it is the river that leads to the resovoir of my truth. With it, I inspire men and angels, empower your guides and spiritual helpers, and lead you into all truth. It is the vehicle of my wrath in judgement and the still small voice in your ear to strenghten and guide you. It is the conviction you feel when you do the wrong and the joy you share when you do the right. It is like the eliksir of heaven thet gently decends to heal help and empower the ones seeking my ways.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok again quite .....mysterious. Is it our higher self then
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ha ......not even close, but maybe we could call you..... MY  lower self just for the fun of it. You gotta go now, and dont worry about that stuf about ....you know

lol sorry, one more question before I goto bed, lol I like this, sooner or later the negative's will not even respond anymore.
<br>
<br>
1) Try to explain as easy as possible with out going into a "wipe on wipe off" type of explanation, no offense.  lol I'm like a cave man, lol i start slow with the learning, lol prolly why people hate it when I ask soo many questions. okay back to the Q.
<br>
Explain to me about Ego if you can.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 How can one try to diminish one's Ego?
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Is a person (i.e myself) that is very very curtious towards others, always kind when others are down, all the extras, have a High ego? (when purposesly thinking about how to get rid of it w/o knowledge)
</b>
<br>
<b>
 <br>
 Does this some how tie in with seeing your guide?
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 If so, what are the signs that you are showing progress on the ego erase project lol?
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 It is possible to see your guides even through your 'closed' eyelids corect? like a faint outline image?

Ok, i admit that at first i thought this was a bunch of bs, but as i read on, a lot of the things God was saying started to make sense, and convince me that this isn't a joke. i *do* have my doubts, but they're hardly there... i do have a few questions, if you (MS) don't mind asking
<br>
<br>
1. ,
<b>
 what exactly are you?
</b>
i know this kinda sounds wierd, but it's hard to imagine. what i mean by this is,
<b>
 are you simply a massively powerful force
</b>
or
<b>
 are you actually a being of some sort? or do the two intertwine with one another?
</b>
<br>
<br>
2.
<b>
 after one dies, do they eventually leave heaven or hell (one or the other, even if terms are different),like reincarnation of some sort?
</b>
<br>
<br>
3.
<i>
 if #2 is yes
</i>
<b>
 are there other worlds/frequencies we are able to go to once we leave heaven/hell?
</b>
<br>
<br>
4.
<b>
 do the Elenari (race of elves) exist, or have they ever existed?
</b>
<br>
<br>
5. i read your description of heaven, and it sounds much more realistic than what i was brought up to believe (i'll assume you know[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
])....
<b>
 is heaven basically a continuation of one's life, just another illusion? or is it reality to some humanly inconceivable extent?
</b>
<br>
<br>
One More Quick Question:
<b>
 as i was writing question 5 something happened it seemed like i was communicating one on one with you... was that actually you?
</b>
<br>
<br>
i feel kinda stupid for asking some of these questions (as far as the last one goes, i'm so worn out for taking WAY too much cough medicine last night[B)] i'm sick, and i'm tired) but assuming MS is in fact communicating with God, i'm willing to ask all i can ask... i'm not sure if all of them are able to be answered just yet (ie:i'll find out when i die, hehe), but either way, it  is  time  for  bed..........
<br>
thanx,

<br>
<br>

 no need the question is answered , but ok.....did you ever hear of the trinity? the massivly powerful force, the personal human/god , and the spirit that binds them together

 ok, here is another
</font>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 after one dies, do they eventually leave heaven or hell (one or the other, even if terms are different),like reincarnation of some sort?
</b>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 after a human spirit passes over then enter the spiritual dimension. The heavens or its lower regions what you term hell. There are still desisions to be made things to be learned and places to go.
</font>
<br>
<br>

</font>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 are there other worlds/frequencies we are able to go to once we leave heaven/hell?

 that all depends on who WE are. Some are bound by the very chains they forged in this life and others soar like the bird Phoenix from the ashes of death, into world eternal and realities of the spirit unknown to mere mortal men, still in the flesh

<br>
<br>

 They are spirits. Some serve me and others serve themselves, and though they have visited in times past they never existed in your world as a race. Here they are known in other ways and by other names

<br>
<b>
 is heaven basically a continuation of one's life, just another illusion? or is it reality to some humanly inconceivable extent?

<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 basically yes but ......not really. Is a the butterfly's life as a free flying heavenly creature a continuation of its life in the cocoon. Basically yes but.....not really. Believe me it will be no illusion. You will know one day and you will understand, you will see.

<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 was that actually you? Hey God did you communicate with her??.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I am getting cryptic now so listen up. I am in the wind and in the very breath of your soul. I am in the world. Not as part of it but permeating it. My Spirit moves as on the waters the masses and multitudes and I seek out the heart of men. In my reality there is no coincidence no accident no luck and no maybe. I am the alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end.

<section>
I have to take the "credit" for that. In the channeling I merely listen to a voice and write down what I hear in audio. Any spelling mistakes grammar problems etc is due to my inferiour spelling abilities and the fact I am not a native english speaker. This is one point in Channeling that has suprised me often. It seems that "God" (lets assume it is God[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]) partly uses my intellect and mind for the formation or creation of the sentences. It seems to me that the further away from my personal situation the questions are, the easier it is to recieve, but often I try to get something about a personal situation and the "channel" seems obstructed or somewhat coloured by my minds knowledge of the situation. This is also the case if I ask something that is Wayyyyy above my intellect's ability , it sort of freaks my mind out (trying to explain here[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
]) and I lose my balance in a way. A bit like Peter walking on the water and looking down and starting to sink. I get in the frame of mind that this is just impossible and as in the astral I create my own impossibilities. It seems to be a matter of faith. Just a few observations.

Can you tell us how you learned to channel and something about the method you use?
<br>
<br>
I think I can sort of relate to what you mean by coloring the channeling with your own personality when the questions are similar to what you want to know or already believe.
<br>
<br>
It seems like it's similar to having a normal conversation, where people color and interpret things the other person says based on their belief system. I would guess that in channeling it's a more pronounced version of that?

<font color='"red"'>
 How do I and others learn to Channel you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 It is not something you learn it is something you grow into. I speak to all of you and if you have FAITH to recieve it you can. Now, Faith is another subject. How to aquire faith?. Well it is also quite simple. Faith is on one hand a gift but also something YOU do. Faith is the hand of your spirit that reaches out and recieves. Hearing from me is an act of Faith, like many other things. I have said this before. First you create a vaccum through prayers to me, the prayers soften the ground like water and then the questions of your heart become the seeds and my answer the is the full grown plant. It is important that you learn of me, study to show yourselves approved as a worker for peace , seek humility and desire my words, and my spirit. Fill your heart with spiritually strenghtening thoughts and ideas and inspirations from what I have allready said and done and your Faith will grow.

</font>
<br>

 aheeem but I am not nor will ever be anything near perfect.....and what is the evil way???
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 In ME you are.Through my LOVE you can enter boldly before my throne. In your flesh you are nothing in your Spirit and with Me in your heart soul and mind you are perfect in my eyes, that is how much I love you. Love is not blind it has a extra spiritual eye that sees the good and possibilities that others cannot see, so ....you, like the ones you love on earth are perfect ....in me. The evil way is a big subject, you better stop now someone is on their way to see you

Thanks to the both of you for that answer. I have some questions that I have not explored with others, maybe I've been saving these for this thread.
<br>
<br>
First question, what is bad about lust?
<br>
<br>
Second question, is there a connection between boredom, free will, and evil?
<br>
<br>
Here's my theory: without free will, we could just think positive loving thoughts and there would be no evil. Would that be boring?
<br>
<br>
If so, is that why we have free will: to explore evil? Does that mean that the purpose of free will is to be evil a least for the sake of seeing what it's like?
<br>
<br>
I'm not asking for your signature on this, I'm hoping you'll blow it out of the water and give me a whole new way of looking at things.

 I had a great night. Thanks
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I enjoyed seeing you enjoy it
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 there are some questions from Cube and one about masturbating!
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 lets take the sex question first
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok lets
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I am the creator of all things, I made the human body to have all those nerves that feel so good, Sex is my best creation no matter if it is enjoyed alone or with someone .....but. There exists also deeper dimensions of Sex and I urge you all to find these. This is why there is a difference between lust and love. Often masturbating is just releasing a pressure, at other times it is a doorway and brings with it many sorrows. Masturbation is often accompanied by fantasy and here lies the danger. The act itself is pure, sex is my creation, but it is possible to still be drawn into a lustfull frame of mind if this pure activity is allowed to become polluted by negs and turns to perversion. Mental pictures hurtfull perversion are not of me, and fantasy blurr the lines between good and bad. Fantasies often take over and in time pollute the mind and have to be acted on. The antidote is selfcontrol in the mental imagining, it is in seeking love, and in moderation.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 The next question is What is bad about lust? This is answered as well then?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Yes but...there is another aspect of lust that needs to be adressed. The lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. My plan is sharing and giving but it saddens me to see so many turn to selfishness to fill the void in their heart. This lusting after material wealth , luxury  and the world, is even more destructive and seductive and perverted that sexual lust. It hardens man to the needs of others and through the love of money and what money can buy , many are pierced with multiple sorrows and grow daily more distant from me and their loved ones
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok how about this one ....
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>
  Second question, is there a connection between boredom, free will, and evil?
 </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  Idle thoughts are a lending library for neg activity. A disciplined mind is a strong city surrounded with walls. In a bored idle mind darkness hides in every corner. Boredom is addictive and brings with it daydreaming this also is a great evil and a enemy of your soul.I have given you the free will to exercise your mind your faith and your spirit or to get lacksidacical laid back and lazy , choose this day who you will serve. This is your time, this is your day and never will it come again. You will not pass here ever with the same opportunity so make the best of it.
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"red"'>
  How about his theory .....
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
   Here's my theory: without free will, we could just think positive loving thoughts and there would be no evil. Would that be boring?
   <br>
   <br>
   If so, is that why we have free will: to explore evil? Does that mean that the purpose of free will is to be evil a least for the sake of seeing what it's like?
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  is that how it works
 </font>
 <br>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  without free will there would be no PROGRESS. There would be no innovation no questions and no desire to seek. Without free will you would be ruled by instinct only, you would react purely in pre programmed ways and you would be just another species of animals. Free will is what sets you aside and makes you different, it is my spark in you. Free will is my creativity, harnessed by your desire. I do not wish for you to do evil, that good may come, not at all, a wise man will learn from his mistakes but a yet wiser man will learn from the mistakes of others, and it is appointed that evil should enter into this world , but woe to the man by whom it enters. In all this do not fear but trust me and listen to my voice in your heart.

<section>
Thanks again to the both of you, I really enjoy this thread.
<br>
<br>
I know some people have a big problem with the idea of channeling God, but consider that these answers are very very good so even if you want to prove that this is another entity you'll probably learn something in the process of trying to prove it's not God.
<br>
<br>
Here are three burning questions I have:
<br>
<br>
1.) How can we make progress for You if You already know everything?
<br>
<br>
2.) Do You desire progress so that You will have an interesting life and not be bored? Another way to say this is did you make all-that-is for fun?
<br>
<br>
3.) Perhaps You know everything but choose to not have experienced everything already?
<br>
<br>
I ask these questions so I can use my free will in the best way.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's another theory as background for the questions which I hope will be torn asunder:
<br>
<br>
How can there be innovation, progress, and questions if God already knows everything that ever was, is, and could be? The base of this question is that I don't understand what it is for something to be perfect.
<br>
<br>
If God just sat there all alone watching the galaxies God made whizz by, after a trillion years or so the been-there-done-that factor would start to kick in and it would get monotonous.
<br>
<br>
God knows everything but chooses not to have experienced everything yet. That's what I meant by a connection with boredom, it's not about human boredom, it's that God would get bored without having friends to have and to watch them discovering and building things.

Hi all
<br>
<br>
Someone wrote me a PM about Donald Walsh and the "Conversations with God" book . It seems, from the message that this person wrote and from what I have come to understand about Donald Walsh and his work, that it would be interesting for me to ask my source (what I believe to be God) if he gave the message in these conversations and I am considering making this the topic of a channeling.
<br>
<br>
I want to thank all of you who has "hung in" on the thread so far. I am considering the possibility of ending it shortly as I have a feeling, from some very pointed messages I recieved in private, that if played out, this channeling could result in some rather unpleasant postings. I am presently contemplating and praying about whether my continued posting is a help or a hindrance to the pulse and the members.
<br>
<br>
Kind Regards to all of you
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed

<section>
Mustardseed,
<br>
<br>
I ask you to consider this: God operates out of love, the opposite of love is fear.
<br>
<br>
Fear is based on uncertainty. You write that "this channeling *could* result in some rather unpleasant postings." So it seems that you're making a decision based on fear, not love!
<br>
<br>
If you really are channeling God, don't you think it would be a hugely wasted opportunity if you shut him down because of a few PMs from strangers?
<br>
<br>
Just see it through, you probably didn't expect it to be an easy ride when you started did you?
<br>

Dear No Leaf Clover

I saw your post but wouuld like to ask if maybe you did not read the very first post on this thread. I ask and Channel what I feel led to, not as people demand.

<br>
Hi Cube
<br>
<br>
Fear is not a consideration at all my friend, it is however my choice in life or here, to do as I feel God would want me to.   I have been involved in other controversies and would not want to do so again. Hope you understand, and I am still thinking and praying about it.

Hi NLC
<br>
Listen my friend, if I had wanted to "cover" anything, as you put it I would have said
<br>
<br>
no they do not exist and put it in blue!!!
<br>
<br>
but.....I did not. Instead I prayed about it and got the following channeling for you. I did not want to include it as I felt I might not be a help to you, but now since you insist here it is.
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I want to ask about NLC
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 he has issues....with YOU
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so what do I do about that[
</font>

<font color='"blue"'>
 pray for him and wait for me to work
</font>
<br>

</font>
<br>

 the Niburi is a non issue, his lack of faith is what I will adress
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 huh?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 he that comes to me must believe that I am and that I am a rewarder of those that seek me, he that does not believe is like a wawe of the sea driven with the wind and tossed....let not that man think he shall recieve anything of me.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I see . OK thanks
</font>
<br>
<br>
It seems that somehow there is a link between the one asking and wether my source even want to talk about the subject asked about, in your case he did not as you see. Now you can just toss this away and say.

Someone's been lying....
<br>
<br>
I have nothing against you, Mustardseed. I was just trying to create some relationship between this post and the other two big channeling operations going on here, which have an obvious relationship to each other, as anyone who's been following along knows. I thought you might see that and avoid any relationship with the other topics (ie coming into distinct agreement or disagreement with what is being channeled in those posts), so I expected you to either beat around the bush or to not answer my question at all. Or I expected God to. Either way I think you know what I'm saying. I thought you understood my intentions and tried to avoid what I wanted, and that's why I said 'nice cover'.

<br>
I wasn't looking for Mustardseed to 'satisfy me' (but if he really wants to.. he can PM me... errr.... KIDDING), but I'm hoping this uninteresting thing has already come to an end before it turned into anything myself. I just thought it'd be interesting to try to compare and contrast the information that's being channeled from the various people here.
<br>
<br>
If Mustardseed had channeled God to say, "Yes, Nibiru exists, but that's a Sumerian word I use for the goat cheese that has molded in my refrigerator. You won't see it flying through the Solar System anytime soon." I wouldn't have cared much more than if he had said it didn't exist, just maybe smiled a little more. Like I said, just trying to compare information from Mustardseed's channelings with channelings from Edi, etc. So far I don't think anybody's asked God any questions that the Zeta or Pleiadians or Reps have been asked, hence my question. It was a question that dealth with a sort of fundamental idea for the ET-related channelings.
<br>
<br>
Hope that clears things up. No trouble meant.

Hi NLC,
<br>
I didn't intend anything negative by using the word satisfy.
<br>
<br>
I would like to point out that Mustardseed channeled that there aren't any reptiles or pleideans, this might explain the cool reaction to a question about Nibiru.

Of course it is your option to decide whether any of this channeling has any truth. I'm just suggesting why this particular channeling might not be interested in being questioned on that topic.

 Dear Cube is touching on a subject that has puzzeled minds for generations. Minds mind you!!!The question is .......WHY. Why this life why did I create the world and why do I continue making this world go around, however it is not understood with the mind but the answer is felt with the heart.
 <br>
 <br>
 The answer is becourse I Love YOU. In me there dwells no darkness no selfishness no ego and no selfserving purpose comes from me. I am light and in me is no darkness at all. I desire that you believe this. After having believed this I desire that you yield your life to me and then, as I gave you this life that you give it back to me. In this ye shall see my life and purpose.This experiment as you call it is not for my benefit but yours. I have yet many things to say unto you , some of which you are not ready to know. Let patience posess your souls for the time is not yet.

I am... has a place, a wheel in a wheel wherefrom goes forth the 4 winds the all consuming fire and from under my throne the lives of many are slung onto the earth. It bears my glory, is compassed about with a host of serving angels beasts of a different kind and the saints in great numbers who all cry out to me day and night and who all fall down before me in praise......but dont forget to tell him to mind his manners

<section>
Thank you again for your answers, this is most educational.
<br>
<br>
Your answer leads naturally to the next topic I desire to understand which is about the Oneness of everything, specifically I am curious about how to resolve where you said: "it is not for my benefit but yours."
<br>
<br>
1.) How separate are we from You?
<br>
<br>
2.) Do You always read our minds and hearts, or just sometimes? I thought it was interesting that it was needed for me to clarify my first question; I didn't think it would be possible to have a misunderstanding.
<br>
<br>
3.) I also have a question about another topic, how do we resolve living in the Now versus creating our reality?
<br>
<br>
To create my reality I first have to visualize it, and then at least for a moment I'm living in the future, not Now. The more I create reality the harder it is to stay in the current instant because I'm thinking about the reality that I want, not what is right Now.
<br>
<br>
I think the solution is to learn to make everything into Play, to always be playing and enjoying fun. But I'm not sure about that because I can't do it yet.
<br>
<br>
Can you help me to understand this? I have a loving friend that will be cheered up if she understands it also.
<br>

God says that in him dwells no ego, yet we have to watch our manners, and He has a host of serving angels (they serve Him ?) and all kinds of saints who seem to be kneeling in front of Him, to say the least, oh praise the Lord.
<br>
<br>
What is this all about ? What am I missing ?
<br>
<br>
I have another question : what happens when in great discouragement, we tell you GOD that we hate Your guts, etc.. ? Is it dangerous for You god or for us to be angry, sick and tired of you, even if you're not responsible for our problems - just because you're not responding (seemingly unresponsive, distant, lofty) ? At least it proves that we do believe, or else we would not even speak to you at all.

 Chill: What is this all about ? What am I missing ?
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 she is missing ......ME, becourse she fails to understand that first principle that whosoever comes to must believe that I am and that I am a rewarder of those who dilligently seek me. If she had done that she would have looked till she understood , as it is now she looked only till she found what appeared to be an inconsistance and her mind accused me before.... her heart.

 I told him to mind his manners becourse he is becoming the person he projects outwardly. He is becoming pushy, abrasive and sarcastic and this is not good for his spirit but is a pollutant.

 what about the worshipping thing, sounds like you do have a bit of ego if that is how you want to be worshipped
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 who says I do. That is her conclusion, not my statement. They fall down before me in gratitude, If I disallowed them to pay back their precieved debt in praises to me , their heart would break. All creation yields to me, ....and I in my love , let them praise me, for I dwell in the praises of creation.

 I know your frame, that you are but dust, I know your frailty and the human heart, even though you are faithless to me I remain faithful to you, I cannot deny myself and I have exalted my promise to you above all, and I will never leave you nor forsake you. I see beyond the hurt the pain and the suffering, and know this, that many are the afflictions of people who seek me, and long for me but I will deliver them out of them all, for I am not willing to let even one perish but all shall come to a knowledge of me, and tell Chill to stop being so angry.....it is bad for HER[

 Cube has some more questions
</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1.) How separate are we from You?
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 It is a enigma as you would call it. On one hand we are worlds apart but on the other we are knit together. As the heavens are higher than the earth so are my way higher than your ways yet if you desire my presense all you have to do is create a vaccum call on me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things that you know not. Mysteries of the universe are yours for the taking.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 this question I find very interesting as well
</font>
<br>
<br>
2.) Do You always read our minds and hearts, or just sometimes? I thought it was interesting that it was needed for me to clarify my first question; I didn't think it would be possible to have a misunderstanding.
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Though I always listen there is often a problem with the Channel, in this case Mustardseed. As I said, the answer is a mixture of my spirit and his intellect and his faith to hear from me. I have limited myself to use this eartheren channel. In my reality there are no words no languages and no trying to understand. As I speak through the channel I limit myself to a degree, to work within his capability to understand the question as well as the answer. The more tuned in the Channel is the more I can work without the confines of the intellect, and the more interferance the more limited my flow and the answers become.
</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 Also a good question
</font>
<br>
<br>
3.) I also have a question about another topic, how do we resolve living in the Now versus creating our reality?
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 The best way is to have faith. To trust in me. If a person believes, through coming to understand about me, a faith is born that afterwards becomes the path to peace. You must learn not to worry about the future, to be content in the state you are in. Not as in being neutral and placid but as in striving, full of the faith that if you take one step for me, learning to love, I will take 2 for you. This faith is born and grows in the heart of man, by the study of faithbuilding words. You shape the reality you live in by the choices you make day by day. You are your own worst enemy but I can be your best friend. He that comes to me I will not cast out, he that seeks me will find me. It cannot be a work of consentrating trying in the arm of the flesh but it must be a work of MY spirit, through being empowered by me.

<br>
<br>
I found that there hasn't been always a perfect correlation between my love for you, God (or maybe somthing else I have mistaken for love), and my love for other people. I have prayed for you to fill my heart with so much love that I would be overflowing with it. And you did help me, everytime. But it didn't last very long, and I had to keep asking, and I feel angry about this because I feel that there should be a connection : by loving you I should love others, it should come hand in hand, but it's not true for me. And then I wonder if I love you only because you're not human, see what I mean ? It's what I call 'falling in love with God', feeling a strong bond with you, invisible, all-powerful, all-love, and wanting to be even closer, almost as if I wanted to be your bride and leave this world to be only with you. Sometimes, when such emotion was felt, this bond, I got on the wrong path, as it alienated me somewhat from the world. Any comments ? (It's not true anymore, mind you).
<br>
<br>
Another question : At some point, years ago, I was thinking that everything good that was happening to me was happening because of you, as if you were always with me, like a knight in charming armor, pulling the strings, making it all possible, writing for me, thinking my good thoughts for me, inspiring my good moves, etc... At some point (do you remember ?) I was in church and I got this rare clear message from you (was it from you ?) that it wasn't the case : that I was also partly responsible for the good things happening to and by me. First I was puzzled : I thought it was my ego talking. But after some thought, I came to realize just the opposite : to think that you were always acting for me in the shadow was my ego talking, to think : it's not me but God with big G pulling the strings for me. You said that you were responsible for some of the things but definately not all of them. That was much less romantic for me, and I felt a little betrayed. Can you elaborate on this ?
<br>
<br>
Thank you Mustard seed for taking all this time.

 ohh .....I see
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Man has always been trying to save himself with just a little bit of help from me thrown in , so he could pat himself on his own back and say "me and God did it". This closeness to self this ego and this looking to the arm of the flesh the physical the effort either in meditation or in prayer is the big big difference between he who is really close to me , and he who is just close to himself. To understand this you must open your heart and your spirit to the things og my realm. The definition of selfrighteousness, is close to self and your own righteousness, which in my sight stinks pretty bad
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 really?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 really really. She does have a strong desire to be close to me and she does hunger for my ways but she is hung up in how she thinks I should answer her prayers and how I should make my moves. In reality she is questioning my ways and not alltogether yielding to what I do and have done in her life
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I can relate to this allright
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 listen ....move over Mustardseed just for a bit.
 <br>
 <br>
 Listen Chill, I really do love you as a lover does and desire you to be mine, and whatever makes you think I want you to be part of this world?. Love not the world nor the things of this world for all in it is pride but love me draw near to me , become alianated from the world and become mine. Seek the things of heaven and of me for the time comes and soon is my dear when you will be in my eternal now, then as earth recedes and as the eternal realities of my Spirit is revealed you will be glad with exceeding joy. Seek to be heavenly minded and in all things seek love. I realise that you need to be connected somewhat to the physical but watch out you do not get sucked in to use and hold up the standard of how the world judges. Your mine and I desire you to look for newness of life that you will seek me and through finding me and faith in my way you will be a blessing to many....ok your keyboard Mustardseed.

I'd like to pose a few questions that maybe God doesn't get asked all the time.
<br>
<br>
1.) What senses do other beings on Earth or other planets have that humans don't have? What are they like and how do they work?
<br>
<br>
<br>
2.) You wrote that sex is Your best creation, would it be possible to make something better? Please tell us about different forms of sex, I imagine there's a lot more to it and ways to express it than what we're used to here in the physical.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.) Here's a news article about a guru who's been living without food or water for 60 years:

<br>
How can one try to diminish one's Ego?
<br>
<br>
Is a person (i.e myself) that is very very curtious towards others, always kind when others are down, all the extras, have a High ego? (when purposesly thinking about how to get rid of it w/o knowledge)
<br>
<br>
Does this some how tie in with seeing your guide?
<br>

If so, what are the signs that you are showing progress on the ego erase project lol?

 Well Ryan lets us reason together. When do you think ones ego is diminishing? Think for yourself. Would you accept that when outbursts like this cease, you are on the right track. You see, this is exactly what ego is all about. You get your answer but becourse you were not credited with having asked the question,  you get offended. So much could get done if you all were less concerned who gets the credit......ego.....Yes your ego is quite strong and to diminish it you should seek to humble yourself for he that humbles himself shall be exalted and he that considers himself small in my presence shall be rewarded, in my way and in my time. Put on the garment of meekness and let all of you each esteem your brother better than yourself. This ego, this pride.... allthough it is a stumbelingblock, has however little influence on your gifts. But beware, even if my gifts to you are without repentance , how you use them and how you behave in the process of using them does have importance. If you have a gift and do not give me the credit for this gift you lay up for youirself many troubles. This was the first fall and the cause of stumbeling of the mighty, the lightbearer, through pride in his heart he was lifted up and yet he was cast down. Behold I see him falling from the heavens like lightening. See to it that you learn this lesson.

 by the way Ryan the outline you saw and your question if it was your your guide......it wasn't, but you wish it had been. It would be so great to have a guide wouldn't it, it would make you real special and unique right? Maybe a warrior, or a wise old sage or an mighty angel ......could this be ego? Think about it, and when you have and when you answer these things I will tell you about your guide

This is the more showy gifts but there are also the gifts of the Spirit, love kindness humility discernment as well as the gift of helps and most of all the gift of wisdom. All these creative gifts are given by my spirit.

<br>

 are there gifts we are born with and come natural then

 but that is not very nice though

 Yea really but this is the way things are so in order to do anything creative you have need of me and my input

 you mean all the good is you and the bad is us

 that just about sums it up....yes
</font>

 and the people that do not believe in you and still are creative and do good things?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ha ....I am not that concerned if they believe in me or not I am the only creative force in the universe and when they partake of anything creative or when they love they partake of MY spirit, and I believe in them and that one day they will understand this. Besides that, the universe is not only created for your benefit alone there are other issues and reasons, but they are way above you for the time being

I had an accident 2 days ago. On the way out the channel going Off shore in heavy winds and we met very large breaking wawes 8-10ft and very steep. We were pounding heavily and our anchor broke loose and started whacking with its point on the bow below the waterline. I sprinted up the deck to grab the chain before it all went overboard and fell on my foot and either fractured or sprained my big toe. We had 3 "checks" that something was to happen.
<br>
<br>
1.On the way out we had been discussing my wifes old deck shoes as she was afraid of falling sinse the deck was very slippery.
<br>
<br>
2.I had felt a need to reduce sail while going out the channel, for no reason I was worried.
<br>
<br>
3. I had noticed the anchor line was tied funny, but trusted my wife telling me it was ok.
<br>
<br>
All in all we were blessed as no damage was inflicted except on me. We could have had a major emergancy
<br>
<br>
I am keen on asking God why accidents like this happen and what makes them happen, but I am in a bit of pain and will wait till later.
<br>

<section>
I'm sure there have been plenty of signs given to me that I never noticed, but I had one recently that was particularly obvious. I'd read in one of the threads here about the power of the earplug when having an OBE. Someone said that earplugs alone put them over the edge from rarely having them to having them fairly consistently.
<br>
<br>
So the other week one of my relatives was visiting and he lost the case for his contact lens. We were driving somewhere and passed by a Target store, he said "We have to go in there and find a case." So we found where the cases were and right next to them were the earplugs!
<br>
<br>
But, for some stupid reason I didn't get any, while he was standing there complaining about how expensive the cases were he found one that had been opened from the packaging. He said, "Well, they shouldn't even be able to sell this one." I think because I was there he decided not to steal it. So I guess it was not a total loss but I still need some earplugs.

 Channeling God

<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 Cube asked
</font>
<br>
<br>
1.) What senses do other beings on Earth or other planets have that humans don't have? What are they like and how do they work?
<br>
<br>
<br>
2.) You wrote that sex is Your best creation, would it be possible to make something better? Please tell us about different forms of sex, I imagine there's a lot more to it and ways to express it than what we're used to here in the physical.
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 are you ok with those questions
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Sure it is interesting to me that Cube asked. The basic question is this: what is the difference between you and the animals and other creations. First lets just adress the fact that a plant can't think ok, no brain no soul nada, no thinking. It can however react to different stimuli, becourse it is an alive creation, but no thinking. It goes like this . Angels, Man, entities, and animals . Matter is the ingridient in them all but they are different. Man has been made a little lower than Angels but a little higher than animals. Even within the animal kingdom there is a variety. My Spirit is the difference. All animals are created for specific purposes, and for that reason they have been endowed with different senses as well as abilities. For the most part they lack reason, the use of the mind, they also lack determination a biproduct of reason and are heavily ruled by their instinkt. Sometimes the lines blur and certain animals can take on almost human properties but this is also the same with man as sometimes certain humans, under certain conditions take on almost animalistic qualities. The difference is .....Me. How much does a man or animal have of my creative qualities. Some have very little capacity but use it more fully and some have a large capacity but use it less. Its pretty complicated.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well....ok I will read it over later what about the other question
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 First let me explain. Sex is a picture of the unity of you and me. In the eternal this unity is the best highest most thrilling thing created, even transending understanding, but you are not there yet so to the question. Love is the answer, anything done in love is good, but anything done for selfish purposes is not good. Mans imagination has become tainted or darkened and his taste buds often become perverted. Think about it like this. A taste for good things is aquired, not something you are born with. You have to learn to eat healthy right, to behave with manners. You have to be taught showing concern kindness and unselfishness, and you also have to be taught to have sex in a loving good way. There is always the pull on humans to pervert things, eat chockolate and surary stuf instead of healthy things, behave with rudeness and to turn the act of having sex into a selfish exercise of lust. Just remember that the difference can be seen in how it affects you, a continual diet of unhealthy food or unhealthy activities will pervert you physically or spiritually and you will loose your health strenght and vitality, or determination inner peace and your sense of fullfillment. You are what you eat and you become what you participate in, in other words run with the wolves and soon you will start to howl.

Thank You for your answers. . .
<br>
<br>
This question is more personal and for my confirmation. I'll give story first then with the question. Past couple months I have been praying for someone to come back to me after being together for 3 years.  I never stopped her from doing what she wanted to do, I just wanted her to be happy. which involved some descisions i didnt aggree on.  Anyway couple months ago, I prayed that shes happy, blah blah, I dont really know wut a right prayer is but thats what i did, cause From then til now, I been hearing how depressed she is, driving drunk, doing back in college, hanging out with bad people.  Now I had this lucid dream that she came over and told me that she broke up with the guy she left me for, he was obsessive and crazy, everyone i warned her about before.  The next day a friend told me she broke up with him.  My friend and her hang out and I've been getting alot of details on how she wished she never broke up with me, how shes depressed, blah blah.  Theres alot more. . .  But with my Prayers and noone else on my side but one person, along with my Love for her,
<b>
 <i>
  is this you 'God' Helping me?
 </i>
</b>
<br>
<br>
When God says Love is the best thing you need to have, but it is SOO hard to get to that love back when its only a phone call away, is waiting patiently rather than going at it rapidly the better thing?
<br>
<br>
<b>
 <i>
  What does God do in these situations? like what things would you do in laman terms do on both sides to reunite the two if there honestly right for each other?
 </i>
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 <i>
  If the situation would risk love, Does God help (if u can understand) Fix mishaps so things CAN be right again?
 </i>
</b>
<br>
<br>
last question am im sorry this is soo long and prolly not under standable
<br>
<br>
If the other person knows she love the other one but really is scared like the other, and has people of family relations, and friends saying what is right,
<b>
 <i>
  Does God intervien(SP?) in helping that person understand what Love is?
 </i>
</b>
<br>
<br>
Thats all [B)]
<br>
<br>
one more!!!!

  How does other peoples prayers help you?

*Sigh* Now for the hard part.  Technically, I don't have to really ask right because you already know the question.  In any case, I will obviously say something to make it applicable to MustardSeed and others.  I am very grateful to have met my love but it is agony not to be able to see her through this long distance relatiohship.  She is extremely advacned spiritually and can split her awareness to me at all times.  I know she is with my in my dreams but I cannot see her.

 God I am gonna ask the question of someone new. But before I do so I have a question myself. I have been thinking about what if someone asks a question about some non exsisting situation and I channel you with advise and their situation is made up?

 well.....just let it go Mustardseed, and do your best. If people try to trick you......it is their problem not yours.

<font color='"blue"'>
 Ok let me level with you about gifts. I do give gifts to certain people. Some are given before birth and they follow someone through their life, some are however given during your life on earth . They can be equaly strong but in a sense of the word are trigger gifts. They are keys given to unlock potential in your life. Some of these are given becourse you have earned them and others becourse you have passed a grade and someone are given becourse I simply love you and your whining pays off[
 <img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
 ]. Just so you understand this concept picture a father and his children or a lover and his love.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 really .....you actually give folks gifts becourse they whine for them?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes I do, but remember ......I know stuf[
 <img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
 ]. I might give someone an ability or gift as you say, but if it is not yet his time and if he is not yet ready it is like giving the keys to a car to someone who does not know how to drive.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but thats terrible....they could crash
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes ....thats the problem, some people only seem to learn that way. Be careful what you ask for. If I have not given certain abilities to you.....trust me trhat I know what is best. If you cant communicate in the spirit or astral as folks like to call it......write a letter or an email or better yet......make a phonecall. I gave someone a gift to invent that machine and that is also a gift to you, be thankful for it and be thankful that you are able to communicate at all
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but it is so much more interesting in the astral and besides what if someone like thin guy wants to be as developed as his friend and wants to catch up....you know be more equal
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 It's Pride and fear....those emotions are not from me, I want folks to be content in whatsoever state they are in. That does not mean they should not try to learn and grow but if you feel that your life is on a detour along some slow country road and not the highway......why not just enjoy the view and....Keep on swimming keep on swimming swim swim swimming [

We all have doubts, saying "I don't know" is really hard, but I really don't know if you channel god or not, but does it matter? Not to me, because I find that your message is possible full of truth, again I don't know if its really truth, but I wont let this chance pass, I will try to bring this possible truth in my life,(and not only because of your post here, but also because it is very much like what i already belief to be "possible truth") truth is self evident so I will know sooner or later. So until I know I just reserve judgment and take enjoyment in reading your posts.

I'm inclined to disagree...
<br>
<br>
Sure, there's no harm in taking into account what 'god' says.
<br>
<br>
But none of us know who it is that Mustardseed is channelling.. neither does he for that matter!
<br>
<br>
I think it's important everyone takes what this God is saying with a pinch of salt... for two reasons :
<br>
1 - this dude could be anyone or anything, and if it isn't god, it's almost certainly going to be something negative, or at least cheeky!
<br>
<br>
2 - life is about experiencing and coming to your own conclusions... well, i say that, that's how i see life, and if that means i'm going to be 'burning in hell with all the other sinners' then so be it.
<br>
<br>
Rob
<br>
<br>
Btw, i didn't mean this message as an offensive one towards the entity you are channeling, i was just putting my two cents forward [^]

I did not want to sound ironic at some point, so I edited or deleted some posts where I was expressing how important Mustardseed's 'conversations' were to me, how 'God's' words deeply moved me, and changed my outlook on life. Either people would have thought I was being ironic (I have a strong inclination...) or easily swelled. In any case, I thank you Mustardseed for taking the time to continue with this important project. Let go even more, when you do it, don't worry about what people think.
<br>
<br>
If it's not God, it's probably your higher self guided by the holy spirit (if one is a believer as I am), or by much wisdom.
<br>
I assume you're not talking to a 'bad' or evil spirit.
<br>
I assume. When I say that, I doubt.
<br>
<br>
I had a nightmare 2 nights ago about 'Satan'. This guy never shows up in my dreams. And I don't believe that he exists as a personified being -- most of the time. He actually did not show up but manifested himself in the physical, in that spooky dream. Anyway, dear God (talking to God now), you know what I mean. And I think it was related, this dream, to Astral Pulse. Later that day, i.e. yesterday at night, I came here and read a private message by Dark Knight (a she) and felt in my gut that the content of her message, and her guidance toward a specific thread on this board, had something to do with my dream. But of course, it's just a hunch. Mayatnik was reading that thread at the SAME time. The dream might have not predicted anything about the future, or might haven't said anything useful about the past and present. I am sorry to be that vague. Let me come back full circle and say to you, Mustardseed this time, that I am not the bit fearful that you are channeling some evil entity, simply because I feel quite strongly that someone somewhere would not allow this to happen to you, no matter how curious you are, no matter how much you want to communicate -- and impress on others some times.
<br>
<br>
Maybe this boils down to self-discovery made public. Maybe it relates only to you Mustardseed (I doubt this though). If this is true, then it can still be useful and important. I will serve a cheap 'n easy analogy with writing - any writer talks about his life, any of his character is actually himself, but the result is universal somewhat and might very likely reveal readers to themselves. Do I make sense ?
<br>
<br>
QUESTION TO GOD : Why am I so ugly these days ? (this past month) And why have I been cute at other times ? What makes me 'beautiful' and what makes me ugly ? My face changes... it's not just my perception. Please explain. And for others : this is NOT trivial stuff to me. It affects the way I live my life, feel about myself to such extent. I think I know the answer but I have doubts.
<br>
Sounds stupid I know... sorry God... sorry Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
answer is 'I am always the same, i.e. ugly' ?
<br>
<br>
fuk I am so depressed with school now and life in general.. I have zero courage, I want to hide from the world, want to accomplish nothing at all, and accept who I really am : a lazy monster, lazy and monster. I can only gather enough energy to feed myself, and get from one place to another.
<br>
<br>
QUESTION NO 2 : what's wrong with Dark Knight ?

Mrsix,
<br>
Please consider that no matter what we have to accept that this is channeled information meaning even if it is God we can't accept it as 100% the truth since all channels can't help but to color the information a bit.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If it is God:
<br>
Then we have to think about what was added or subtracted by the channel medium =&gt; we have to use our best judgement.
<br>
<br>
If it is not God:
<br>
Then we have to think about what was this entity is up to =&gt; we have to use our best judgement.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whether it's God or not we have still have to decide for ourselves what the truth is, so really the whole question of whether it's God or not ends in "it doesn't matter".

I guess that is true!
<br>
And either way, i'm enjoying this thread! [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
The thing is, i'm not a Christian, Chatholic, or whatever..
<br>
<br>
I don't believe in a God per se..
<br>
which perhaps leads to an interesting question if you don't mind putting it forward Mustardseed:
<br>
<br>
If I were to live my life to the end, loving it, cherishing it, loving others, doing good deeds.. not worshipping you, or your existence, but worshipping the gift of life itself and all of creation..love, etc.. is there really a difference?
<br>
My notion of God is not what the bible says, or any text that i'm aware of.. I guess my idea of God is everything that is.. we are all part of the same thing. Everything is God, makes up God.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, following that belief, I am a part of God as well... I make up the universe much the same as any Man, Woman, Dog, Squirrel does...
<br>
<br>
but, that's just me!
<br>
What say you?
<br>

From the LOsing my religion site :
<br>
<br>
"God says do what you wish, but make the wrong choice and you will be tortured for eternity in hell. That sir, is not free will. It would be akin to a man telling his girlfriend, do what you wish, but if you choose to leave me, I will track you down and blow your brains out. When a man says this we call him a psychopath and cry out for his imprisonment. When god says the same we call him "loving" and build churches in his honor."

"God says do what you wish, but make the wrong choice and you will be tortured for eternity in hell."
<br>
<br>
The quote starts out with a fallacy. It's not an eternity, it's however long you keep yourself there. It's just like here in the physical where people build their lives into private hells, they'll stay there as long as they don't pull themselves out of it.
<br>
<br>
Also, I really don't buy the standard issue Christian version of hell where it's just mindless torture and flames. There's purpose to it which is to force you to come to terms with areas where you're imbalanced. You naturally gravitate to people who are similarly imbalanced, and collectively you create your own hellish reality.
<br>
<br>
Murderers congregate with murderers and create a murderous reality, rapists congregate with rapists and so forth.
<br>
<br>
There would be nothing to hold people there other than their own imbalances, it is infinite time in the sense that it's not bounded by God, but the person's free will.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 I would like to ask God, is this at all accurate of the way hell is set up?

First, thank you so much MustardSeed, your work here is so very much appreciated.  It does not go unnoticed.  I can see how if you looked deeply at my situation, it may seem unreal and made up.  (Hahah, "thin guy") Beleive me... I am having a difficult time dealing with these changes and meeting this girl.  She is incredibly rare, if you know about her please know keep it just between us.  Thank you in advance for not posting about it in detail.
<br>
<br>
God, hahahah "keep swimming" [

]... wonderful.  I love the double meaning (I went swimming today for the first time in a very long while out of the blue)  Thank you for the advice, that is a wonderful state of mind to be in... "just enjoy the ride."  As you know, I am separated by distances that do not allow phone calls and e-mails for the most part.  This situation seems so spectacular... at times it seems like the whole universe's eyes are on me.  Well it is 2:00 a.m. time for a walk to the good ol water revisor on the hill.  Thank you God for... everything.

My idée of God is the Taoism Tao.
<br>
<br>
From
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///taoism.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Taoism.net
</a>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  Tao Te Ching – Lao Tzu – Chapter 1
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tao that can be spoken is not the constant Tao
  <br>
  The Name that can be named is not the constant Name
  <br>
  The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
  <br>
  The named is the mother of myriad things
  <br>
  <br>
  Thus, constantly free of desire
  <br>
  One observes its wonder
  <br>
  Constantly filled with desire
  <br>
  One observes its manifestations
  <br>
  <br>
  These two emerge similarly but differ in name
  <br>
  The unity is the mystery
  <br>
  Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <br>
  <br>
  Interpretation
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tao that can be spoken of, or be completely explained in words, is not the constant, eternally unchanging and true Tao.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the name of this Tao can be named or defined with words, then it is not the constant, eternally unchanging and true Name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Names did not exist prior to Creation. The nameless Tao is therefore the source of the universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once it manifests itself as the physical universe, it can be named. Everything is derived from it through natural processes. It is therefore the mother of all things.
  <br>
  <br>
  If we approach the Tao without the interfering desire for knowledge, we can observe its wonders, intricate marvels, and beauty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If we approach the Tao full of the desire to pursue knowledge, then we can only observe its physical manifestations, rather than its inner essence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
   The Tao's external manifestations (life, nature, the cosmos, and so on) and its inner wonders (oneness, the living void, the flow, etc.) are both emergent properties of the ultimate reality. Although we call them by different names, they are but two sides of the same coin.
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  This unity of the two aspects gives us an interesting paradox. They seem distinctively different, and yet they lead to one another. Understanding of the Tao's inner essence gives one greater understanding of its outer manifestations, and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Our recognition and acknowledgement of this paradox will open the door for us to further explore the infinite wonders of the Tao.
  <br>

<br>
<br>
So my question to God is
<b>
 (pay attention mustardseed !)
</b>
; How can this non-persona God (oneness, the living void, the flow, etc.) be the one speaking to you?
<br>
(You must understand I want no proof, just an explanation.)

 see you are learning as well. Dear Chill I am not gonna kid you ok I am gonna tell you the truth. There is evil in this world as well as people who are facinated by evil, there are people who are ugly so to speak. I did not intend for them to be that way but they have turned out that way by the choices they make, they have pl,anted and they are reaping in their own life as well as the lives of everyone they touch. It is up to you to decide what you are going to do about it. It is tempting to say it is no use there is so much darkness but even just a little candle can be seen miles around when it is dark. You cannot fight darkness Chill you cannot beat at it with your fists and when you scream at it it drives you insane with its eccoes of emtiness, so what is to be done you ask. I will tell you switch on the light, just turn on ....thats all turn on the light and the darkness will flee of itself. You are beautiful but you must remain beautiful by tending the garden. The garden of your spirit nurture it do the best with what you have and look up to me and see your face reflecting sparkeling and glowing as you dwell in me. Look down and all that will reflect in your face is the shadows of life as well as the cares problems and fears of the abyss. There is nothing there for you, stay in the sun my love in the bright sunshine and be not lured to the edge, and you shall have peace love and beauty and it will be plain for all to see

666th post... can't wait for you to break that mark Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
In my dream, there was a group of people in a big house. The way that Satan manifested Himself -- and it's hard to explain why but I was absolutely certain in the dream that it was Satan -- was by drawing the picture of a fish in sand.
<br>
<br>
The sand surface was inside a see-through glass cube, like the ones used to protect modern art pieces in museums. As if invisible fingers had had made the drawing. The drawing might have shown up in a split second. In any case, the surface was flat, then when we thought to look at it next there was that drawing of a fish.
<br>
<br>
Done.
<br>

Thank you Mustardseed.

"IT IS DONE"
<br>
<br>
Is this a reference to the 7th vial I wonder?
<br>
<br>
I found this page that says there are three times in the Bible where God says "It is done."
<br>
<br>
1.) In Genesis at the end of the creation of Earth
<br>
2.) When Jesus is on the cross
<br>
3.) In Revelations when the 7th vial is emptied during the end times.

<section>
Mustardseed, have you considered that the reason why 'God' doesn't want to go 'there' -- or for you to go there -- in regards to Mayatnik is that you are channeling similar species ?
<br>
Earlier in this thread he said that they were no aliens per say but that they were definately existing nevertheless.
<br>
<br>
So far your God has only proved that he was a very intellectual(intelligent) being, not that He was God in any way. I am stating the obvious obviously. As a matter of fact, you might have made up all of the answers. You're that smart and that wise and that good. You are a really good person. Not that I think you have done this, at least not consciously so.
<br>
<br>
It's very difficult for me to believe blindly in something based on occasional proofs, or coincidences. I would have a vision of an angel appearing before me -- and I would later either question the vision (was it some kind of hallucination) or question WHOM I saw exactly.
<br>
<br>
I still have faith in God on most days, but more and more I have many intellectual and also intuitive doubts as to the very nature of God.
<br>
<br>
It would seem logical according to some theories that fallen angels are communicating with humans now, and even that they can make things happen. After all, they are 'angels', they would then have some sort of supernatural powers.
<br>
<br>
Zetas came here on Earth to 'pollute' the human race at some point, according to some theories, and they might be the 'fallen angels' the bible talks about...
<br>
<br>
I am relieved though to have learnt from the ones who did the reasearch for me (wrt to Mayatnik) that the entities this guy is in contact with are clueless about other humans - they cannot see other people, guess anything about them, nothing, they have access to absolutely no knowledge about other people, i.e. the people who did the experiment for me --- contrary to what Mayatnik claims.
<br>
<br>
Same for your God so far. Not that I tried to trick you. I did not.
<br>
I was genuine.
<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, this afternoon, it fell over me that I have been too gullible, wanting so much this to be true.
<br>
<br>
I am telling you this because I am slighlty worried for you now.
<br>
<br>
Of course your God will say that I am only 'backing up'...
<br>
<br>
I know that I am not supposed to take what is said here without a grain of salt. But.. anyway.. sorry.
<br>
<br>
You have to be careful when someone says 'you are absolutely BEAUTIFUL' and 'I love you' etc... All this talk. Very sweet, very loving, but could be 100% manipulation.
<br>
<br>
Not that the guys Mayatnik &amp; associates are in contact with use such language. Manipulation is more efficient when tailored to fit a particular character.
<br>
<br>
Is your God clueless ? I don't want to trick you, Mustardseed. So maybe you can ask Him if this could be sorted out, if he could start by giving some specific info, more than the coincidental double-meaning 'swimming, swimming', which is not convincing to me.
<br>
<br>
Oh well.
<br>
<br>
If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn't.
<br>
<br>
If fallen angles do exist and can lie, than everything is possible, you might very well speak to one of them now, no ?
<br>
<br>
You mentioned in much earlier posts, in some other thread, that you have the gift of speaking tongues. Is this connected to your gift?
<br>
<br>
I really like you Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
Don't be sorry for wasting all this time on me. I am sure it hasn't been wasted on other people.
<br>
<br>
Damn.
<br>
<br>
If only... if only...

<section>
Dear Chill
<br>
Thanks for your message. I would like to discuss it with you as well as anyone else here. I have ofcourse been thinking and praying about what or who I am Channeling as well as what and who the Zetas are. I have an Idea but felt it was better to keep it to myself up till now but maybe we could discuss it.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, I do believe that what I channel is Gods Spirit. I really do. However I do not believe it is God per se sitting on a white throne with a cellphone allthough this is the format I HAVE CHOSEN. The reason I chose it is partly becourse it fits with the CHANNELING craze that seems to have hit the Pulse these days. In my understanding God can speak through any means he wants and even uses even our faults to make sense to others. I believe that Gods nature is like that. He will bring order in chaos and love and comfort where there is none.
<br>
<br>
I was very surprised at the words that came to me, channeled towards you, and also worried that they were too ......sort of personal, but they did come to me and I wrote them down as I felt them. There is also the possibility to consider that folks (i.e. you ), now adays are simply hardened by the lack of words such as these used in our lives and therefore reject them as a result. It seems that suspicion is mainly directed at anyone who is "too nice". Maybe this is justifiable, but I do not think it is a nice or wise trend. I happen to believe and am confident that according to my sources (the Bible) God loves us all, as if we were the only one in the Universe. In YOUR case I believe He loves you more than you are aware and his spirit which is always positive and uplifting wants to remind you of that. Thats just my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Some very funny things have also happened on the thread. I channeled a message to Mr Balloney[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]and wrote "thin guy" and this message really hit home with him, somehow or another it "clicked" . However as far as I remember I have no recollection of writing "thin guy" and reading over it again I believe I was writing "this Guy" . I cant be sure but I think so. Well how does that work then?, is God even able to use typos and make them inspire others.?(Balloney I will answer your PM as soon as I have time)
<br>
<br>
Those are all questions I ask myself. I would strongly recommend that you do not start to look to my channeling as absolute, nor look to it for answers and an easy way out.
<br>
<br>
My only defense and "authority" for doing this Channeling,  if it could be called that, is a life long service to God as a Missionary, a lifelong intense study of The Bible and other material of very spiritual nature as well as a life of OBEs and very (in my view) wonderful prayer activity. These things I view as a ballast, and I believe they will keep my Channeling on an even keel.
<br>
<br>
I do thank you for your concern and kind words and look forward to hear from you about this. I certainly do not want to give you the impression that I somehow have the only channel to God, far from it. Maybe we could talk about the Zeta as well, if it can be done respectfully and without offending the people who channel them, that might be a interesting subject.
<br>
<br>
Now before you say to yourself that "ahhhh it is all made up" let me say again. I really do not think it is. I have recieved many very mysterious messages that mirachelously guided me through many of a tight spot, I believe that God is able to use anyone to speak through. Even a "butt" like me.

Regards to you and all others, thanks again for reading and asking questions. Seeing that this thread is maybe the fastest growing thread on the Pulse(allthough it has not been made Sticky for some reason[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
])it is apparent that some folks "out there" is interested in what God has to say about stuf, and it is my prayer that somehow His Spirit will come through, to encourage help love and meet the need, by helping you to interpret or apply what you read and make it His Words to YOU.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

Ah so you channel godliness, but not god in literal sense.
<br>
<br>
Have you ever asked god (or the godliness from whitin) what he thinks of the bible ?

 You see this is the double edged sword of humanity. Becourse they have been given the ability to choose, they are constantly boggled down trying to decide what to choose. A lot of people would do a lot better if they would learn to go with their instinkt their gut feeling and not be so critical and doubtfull of everything, basically it is fear of being tricked used or abused and since fear is not of me they are getting all messed up and they suffer. Instead they should just try to relax a bit ....you know enjoy life and not take everythinbg so seriously.

<section>
Wow thinking of questions for God is hard!  I seem to already have answers for most of the things I would like to know.  Either that or the questions are unimportant... Okay maybe it is time to shed some light on my collective consciousness ideas.
<br>
<br>
You say "if two or more are gathered in your name."  Well, what about millions of people gathered?  You must know about the Coast to Coast AM experiments done with millions of listeners focusing on one thing and perhaps deflecting hurricanes of the East coast.  The collective conscious power can be quite large when we are all in agreement on something.
<br>
<br>
So after thinking about all these things, and understanding more just how very much in control of our reality as a collective we have... I began to worry about what today's religions and fears teach people today which is "end times," apocalypse, rapture and dooms day.  I think that if these beliefs persist, they may come to pass exactly as people fear.  This is all dependent on the finer workings of the collective consciousness, which of course I don't quite understand.  Care to delve into this one God?

Mustardseed, will you channel this for me? I thank you in advance for your efforts to answer such a great question.
<br>
<br>
Hi God
<br>
<br>
This Universe of yours is pretty cool! I've had some pretty horrible times in it to the point where I wanted to die in all dimensions and cease to exist, but I've had some pretty cool times too, and those are worth sticking around for. Thanks for the free will you gave me and thanks for everything that has brought me to any kind of spiritual advancement. I know I can type to you through this forum, and you already know that I do it out of weakness. But I also know that I can talk to you whenever I want. You rock. I guess typing this out is just "manual labor" to show my appreciation for what I already know to be true.

 <br>
 Dear EW
 <br>
 You are just beginning to see and understand both my nature as well as the answer to the question everyone asks.......WHY. What is the reason for it all. You see my nature in brief glimses and you almost feel me. I dwell in the praises of my people, I smell the sweet fragance of the praise that rises from a thankful heart and I am able to bless such a heart. Some come to me without praise they do not believe in my omnipresesce and my righteousness and the answers to their questions elude them. Those that come to me must believe that I am and that I am a rewarder of those who dilligently seek for me, seek for me and seek for my purpose in everything they go through. You can have no appreciation for light unless you have been in darkness no appreciation for health unless you have been sick. This is the purpose of existance, to love for by doing so you partake of my heavenly nature and you know me for I am Love as well as everything pure and good kind. You do have your part, you have to roll away the stone you have to do the typing you have to pray the prayers and live the life. You are not given strenght and blessings to go through life cheerfully but you are given strenght and blessings WHEN you go through life cheerfully. You have done well in many things you still lack in some but I do not see your shortcomings and failures as problem but opportunities for you to learn and grow even more. From the ashes arose as if by magic a pure white Lilly it raised its head and lifted its small green leafy hands in praise as it looked into the sun, the garden was at peace and even the mighty oak nodded their crowns in a silent approval.

A question for god.  Do you know what I will become in the future or are you in the present (considering free will and all that)?  How can I become closer to you (I have surrendered myself to you, but I would like to bath in your presence)?  How can I help others find your light?  Who was it that laid their hand upon my head and what did it mean?  I don't understand what you mean when you say have faith.  Shouldn't we know your presence, your existence.  It seems faith is without proof.  Well heck you understand me.

<section>
Okay, about being closer, to God, I have read a book about Kundalini creative energies, and opening the chakras.  But I am not that far and also believe thats just another name to all the different names relateing to energy and meditation.
<br>
<br>
But I am also still new, and still learning the bible and God himself.  In the bible they say something about you urging people to meditate, and find yourself closer to god.  Can you or MS kinda give me some tips on how to read him, and varify that Im not reaching anyone else BUT you?  And I apologize for my selfishness acts in recent posts.
<br>
<br>
During the day I thank God alot and doing my work, I ask questions, not expecting an answer or anything. but Reading 'Purpose Driven Life'  I kind of HAVE too. or want to TRY too, 'when god seems distant, its a test of faith.' I want to try harder, thanks.

<br>
Oh couldn't you convince God to talk a bit about the Zeta's and what's going on? I'm interested in what he has to say about it, even if only a few words.
<br>

Also I already asked (but have no answer), but what does god think about the bible, was it really his word and is it completely true?

</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>

</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 we covered that before Mustardseed, but I will repeat it in another way so it is clear to you and everyone else
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok....thanks
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 my world the world of the spirit is built on certain principles, foundations if you will. The physical universe is built on and with matter as well as the laws that rule matter. The Spiritual is similar, but at another level, matter exsists but in a different form. Some call it this, some call it that, what it is called, is of no importance. The physical and the spiritual is linked up in various ways. The two universes can reach, touch and influence each other through different processes. The veil seperates them but it can be breached.
 <br>
 <br>
 Man is made in 2 parts, the physical and the spiritual, but is locked into a sequence. Think of it as a computer with limited ram. Each time people gain faith in the spiritual realities they add components to their machine, and are able to acces more programs, use it more efficiently, adding soundcards graphics etc these are all added by you.These are the realities of my spirit.
 <br>
 <br>
 HOWEVER .......what people do with their new and more powerfull machine is what determines their value to me. Some only play games some use it as a typewriter but some surf the net deciding to grow and they use it all they can to educate themselves .You are what you build
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ohhh interesting........but in this picture what are you and what about meditation and stuf
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I am the 24hour supportline that comes with a new machine, I can not only tell you how to use it, but I can also see how it is running and how you are doing. I can upload new programs to you, as I see you need them, and fix anything that goes wrong.
 <br>
 <br>
 Some people are born with a rebellious streak, their head is bloody but unbowed. They wanna build their own computer, and they put it together any way they can. Some of their parts are pirated some and generic but they do not care about the law and some even hack and crack to get ahead. They live lives of thrill, but largely delve into the darker side, and messing around with the mashine becomes their main occupation, rather than using it as means to an end, it becomes an end in itself. It is a choice you all have to make.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ohh....ok interesting picture
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I thought it was pretty neat
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so let me recap here.....Meditation and so forth as well as chakras and all that is real

<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes...they are blocks components and parts, that you all have the ability to access and use, they are processes, but I am the help hotline

More information needed.  Last two days since I read about, 'when God seems distant' you have to test your faith instead of try to feel for him.  Since I did this the other day.  Yesterday Night I tried for my first time and accomplished for my first time telekinesis.  Is this a God given gift? or did I some how outa of a rabbits hate pull this out of my bottom?  I soo impressed by this I have not stopped doing it for 2 days now.  It gets even more impressible with my fingers, i can pull tinfoil, drag circle magnets on the counter, 'pull' light things.  NEVER tried it before! explain this to me possibly. unless its a gift everyone capable of having.

Hi mustardseed, I want to say I think what your doing is great. I really appreciate it. First tell God how much I love him and tell him I'm sorry for all the sins and all the things I have done to displease him. I have some questions if you will ..
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to be a bother, I know you have a long line of people wanting help and all
<br>
<br>
So here I go
<br>
<br>
What exactly am I keep dreaming about? (I been having dreams of being paraylzed and an enity keeps attacking me, even have a weird empathic dream)
<br>
<br>
Is it me, or is something trying to do me harm or contact me? Is it just merely my subconcious or is there something more?
<br>
<br>
That dream a year ago where evil was feeling my chest, was it something I did? I mean was that the result of my own negative actions? Was the dream last night about my guide?
<br>
<br>
Am I on the right track in life so far?
<br>
<br>
Why is it that I have difficulty expressing myself, talking to others and etc? What did I do wrong to cause this deep anxiety?
<br>
<br>
I just been feeling so distressed. Why is my personality changing all of a sudden? Why can't I forgive my father? Why am I all of a sudden feel so distant with my mother, why am I causing her pain when she did not deserve it? What is wrong with me?
<br>
<br>
Also in my other thread "Seeing orbs" in the energy devolpment forum, what exactly am I seeing? I been curious for a long time.
<br>
<br>
please always know that i love you
<br>

<section>
Eyes,
<br>
<br>
Here are some things I've learned that have helped me deal with similar obstacles. Probably the most useful thing has been to release things that no longer serve me then embrace things that do.
<br>
<br>
For instance before I go to bed I lay down and quiet my mind, I usually start out sending blessings to the world but sometimes things pop into my head that are negative. What I do is stop, consider the thought. If it's an old thoughtform that is worthless to me (such as a fear) I think ("I release fears of XXX"), then I think of the opposite and think ("I embrace love for YYY")
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I'll just go through and embrace all love and release all fear. On the inhale "I embrace love", in the exhale "I release fear"
<br>
<br>
What is interesting is that I've banished fears this way without even addressing those specific fears. I used to be scared of insects to the point where I would be paralyzed with fear to be in the same room as a spider, I could not even bear to look at a picture of one.
<br>
<br>
The other day I came across a dead June bug and felt nothing! I picked it up, to prove a point to myself I put it on my tongue. Nothing! The fear has been totally dissolved and now I can let spiders walk all over me with no reaction. I had never really told myself to release my fear of bugs but it went away with the rest of the fears.
<br>
<br>
Note that you don't have to do this when meditating, it can and should be done at all times. I think a good goal to have is to enter into a state of mind where you're perpetually releasing worthless thoughtforms and searching out and embracing positive ones so that your impression of the world is always on an upswing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
That sums up releasing fear, if you want to release guilt there is actually something useful you can extract from it before you release it. I'll put that in my next post.

<section>
Eyes,
<br>
When a child is learning to ride a bike and falls over, there is no guilt felt. Why? Because the child is aware that it is in the process of learning, so there is no use for guilt over making a mistake.
<br>
<br>
However a guy who accidentally dumps a ton of asphalt on his grandmother is likely to feel guilt because he is not in learning mode, he is focused on his failure to be responsible, becomes focused on lack of self worth, and feels guilt. An aware person would simply address the issue, take steps to ensure it never happens again, seek foregiveness, learn and move on.
<br>
<br>
An aware person does not need guilt and does not feel guilt. All mistakes are simply lessons learned or not learned. Nothing more, nothing less.
<br>
<br>
People feel guilt because they are not focused on learning from mistakes but become focused on lack of self worth, and so feel guilt when a mistake is made.
<br>
<br>
<br>
We can actually program lack of self worth into ourselves simply in the way we structure sentences, that will be my next post.

<section>
Consider that you can't tell a child, "Don't eat those cookies" without saying the phrase, "Eat those cookies". So by telling the child not to eat them it actually becomes more difficult for the child to resist the cookies.
<br>
<br>
Now consider what happens when the question is asked, "Why am I causing her pain?" This phrasing contains the idea "I am causing her pain."
<br>
<br>
The more a person asks that question, the more they beleive they are causing pain. The more they beleive they are causing pain, the more they will obsess over it and continue asking the question. This is the cycle that must be broken.
<br>
<br>
It is important to identify which things bother us, and to ask questions. However it is just as important to find a way to release them once identified. A solution is to simply be careful to phrase things in the most positive way possible and avoid words that negate such as "don't".
<br>
<br>
For instance, "Save those cookies for later" has no hidden commands. "How can I help her feel joy?" does contain a command but it is a positive one.
<br>
<br>
So, it really comes down the the fact that we all get the reality we believe in, and it's important to figure out what reality we're programming ourselves into with the use of words.
<br>
<br>
<br>
You also asked about dealing with dealing with negs when sleeping, I started a thread about this here:

Dear Kuhl
<br>
Before I try to get a channeling going let me first try to explain something about my channel and how it works for me. From what I understand I have been explained that He works through and with my intellect and that I channel His words by fitting them into a context that I decided on. In this case the question and answer mode. I asked why this is how it works and he explained that it is becourse my channel is still not clear enough and developed enough. My question was , that if he is all seeing and knowing and all that why do I have to understand what anyone says at all. Could not someone just write to in even another language and he could answer fluently in that language, or maybe not ask the question but just ask for God to answer the question in their heart.
<br>
<br>
It seems that in order to have the faith to recieve anything I myself have to somehow obtain the faith to ask, and in order to have the faith to ask, I personally feel the need to understand the concept question and so on. All that said and done it seems to be getting a bit easier but still requires a labour in the spirit prayer etc. I would also like to remind everyone that the channeling is only my opinion, in other words it is my opinion that it is Gods spirit talking,but I cannot prove it nor do I feel the need to.

<section>
Mustardseed,
<br>
I think you are correct about your theory why misinterpretations are possible. I feel it all comes down to where you channeled Source saying 'you are all in school.' I feel that EVERYTHING we experience is just for learning and if God did everything for us there would be no point to this life.
<br>
<br>
Here's a really good short story that sums this all up:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.thisisawar.com/InspirationLittle.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.thisisawar.com/InspirationLittle.htm
</a>
<br>
<br>
One other idea I like that describes this view of things. It's like God is a huge glowing mirror, but it's not easy for a mirror to see itself. So God broke up into little pieces and we all reflect the light around to see each other. Sometimes we merge back together and sometimes we fragment more. It's all a process for experiencing everything in all ways.

I am still stunned by some folks total rejection of the possibility that God speaks to man, as well as their acceptance of aliens, greys, and dragonians to mention a few channeling threads.
<br>
<br>
Could you be unaware of the fact that God has spoken to countless people down through the ages. From simple people like Joan of Arc to Kings and prophets. Do you dismiss the notion that God communicates with man and man with God through prayer, or is it merely ME that is unable to do so ?

  I am not kiddin you at all my friend. If you believe it to be "a crock" as you put it, I have no problem with that, however before you make yourself a spokesman for "everybody" you would be wise to ask everybody what they think first. Otherwise ...speak for yourself.

  I am still stunned by some folks total rejection of the possibility that God speaks to man, as well as their acceptance of aliens, greys, and dragonians to mention a few channeling threads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Could you be unaware of the fact that God has spoken to countless people down through the ages. From simple people like Joan of Arc to Kings and prophets. Do you dismiss the notion that God communicates with man and man with God through prayer, or is it merely ME that is unable to do so ?
  <br>
  <br>
  If you care we could discuss this in a philosofical way with mutual respect, but if you feel the need to use agression and ridicule, I thank you for your opinion and hope you wont mind I disregard your posts.

<font color='"red"'>
 God I have a question
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ha.....you certainly do
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I thought about it for a while and I really have some big questions with the channeling threads
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 and....
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I wanna know why I should not "go there" as you said. It seems to me that folks would like your input on these things
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 some maybe but some want to believe what they believe. Their mind is made up dont confuse them with the facts
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so why dont you wanna tell me about the Zetas and if Mayatnik is really channeling aliens
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 becourse I love you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 huh....what has that got to do with anything
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it has everything to do with it. YOu really wanna get your nose into that stuf dont you?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yeaa kind of I guess
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 thats what I am saving you from. It is so much easier to find fault to tear down to critisise and to destroy, and you are pretty good at it when you are on your own
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yea I know.....but this is different. What if it is a false channel and leading people astray then it would be good to put it down right
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 says who???
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well dont you say that?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 no Mustardseed I said ....stand back and see me fight. I said in all things be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect. I said seek not to destroy but to build. Seek not to create your own righteousness but let each of you esteem the other greater than yourself and learn of me for I am meek and lowly of heart and then you shall find rest to your souls. Love is what you need
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so .....are they telling the truth?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 you must judge....and tell all that they must judge for themselves as well. Whatsoever is not according to my word , whatsoever causes you to get down sad critical afraid unhappy or fearful is not of me but is created in the shadows. Like a tree look at the fruit for a prophet or channel is known by their fruit. A good tree brings forth good fruit and a bad tree bad bitter fruit. Look at the long term effect and if you must judge .....judge righteous judgement. Do not lift up your flesh and carnal mind but pray against pride, you have a lot of it, and it does you no good.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well.......ok then. I will have to think about that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 and Mustardseed.....dont tinkle me off. Yea you heard me. If I say dont go there you are best served by obeying me and trusting me...OK. I love you but you get a bit testy at times, you should work on that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 OK sorry about that...I really am. I know you are right , about me that is. I have a long way to go
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 just let me carry you....dont try so hard, just let me help you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I will try goodnight

 goodnight Mustardseed

Unfortunately the Christian god is only one aspect of the divine numinous. If anything I would say that the christian god is a tribal god created from the projection of a very childish, immature people.
<br>
Hence when they fell at the feet at the ammonites they inflated the ego of the tribal god. I have actually summoned jehovah and found it to be weak, parasitic, adn in need of a good banishing.

Dear Arkansai
<br>
<br>
To tell you the truth, I am getting a bit upset about this issue myself. Why is "He" dodging this issue. As you might know i am sort of doing a automatic writing and I am very dissapointed with the answers on this issue so far.
<br>
<br>
I will think about it, but I am leaning towards confcronting "Him" and getting it all up front. To me it seems like a cop out.
<br>
<br>
All that said and done, it is my experience that "God" has never led me into anything destructive nor has he ever led me into anything that tears down or puts down.
<br>
<br>
For the record let it be said that I personally believe Mayatnik Edi and Fuzziwig are in touch with very sinister forces. I do not think they are Aliens but Negs, and instead of guiding people they are leading them astray and confusing them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This however is only My opinion (apologies guys) and I have not really felt confident in asking "God" point blank, nor have I had the desire to confront the issue any other way.
<br>
<br>
It seems evident to me that the Zeta issue is being empowered by the Moderators. So far the Zeta is the only thread that has been made sticky, all though the "Channeling God" thread has had almost 75% more hits and remain the most visited thread on the Pulse to date.
<br>
<br>
Why is that? and what is the agenda or reason behind that dear moderators.....Adrian....Nick....Nay... RB ....Anyone....

It would be more productive to channel things purely for the fun of it rather than endlessly wring our hands about this or that.
<br>
<br>
What does it matter if one topic is sticky or another one is not? If people read the thread it will stay on top, if they don't reply to it then it should rightly sink to the bottom. Probably the only threads that really need to be sticky are the Donation ones.
<br>
<br>
What difference does it make if it is God or not or if anyone at all cares or believes? These are just pixels on the screen in either case.

<section>
Something I read that really resonates with me is that at the most fundamental level, the only difference between a 3rd, 4th and 5th dimensional awareness is the level of joy a person experiences.
<br>
<br>
I know some people who can psychically heal, remote view, and listen to plants' thoughts and yet they still get sad and worried like I do sometimes. Their abilities aren't protection against basic everyday emotions. So I really do think that the dimensional shift has much less to do with psychic powers and much more to do with just being happy and productive with what we've got.
<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that sometimes if we've got a lot of abilities it just makes it harder to be happy because there's more to manage and be responsible for.

<section>
I think a reason why god doesn't want to give mustardseed a anwser to his zeta question might be , because he would get upset either way. He now bliefs negs are channeled, but if it turn out this way he wants to do anything to destroy to operation, on the other hand if they are not negs this would give him alot of doubt and confusion.
<br>
<br>
Still i think this is an important question, should you really let it go? I think for me this question would have been important enough to seek the confrontation. Wright or Wrong? I don't know, i depends on many factors, one how much trust do you have in your god and (and this you can only gues) he in you? What is your relationship, how close is it, shouldn't you just be able to ask and recieve a honest anwser?
<br>
<br>
I think the awnser to happyness is concious and the lack of it brings us misery, thats why is important to get to know ourselfs, to wake up!
<br>
<br>
And physic abilities can help you in your quest, but if seen as a goal on their own they bring you no more happyness than mundanne things, take astral travel for example, its a good tool to rialize we are not our body and it also gives us a oppertunity to talk to higher beings, and can be fun, but when its all over you have to live life just as normal and it doesn't help you whit that.

<br>
<br>
I agree, I should clarify and say that abilities are really a double edge sword and can be a lot of fun. But if a person isn't able to obtain happiness without them, they aren't going to have much luck being happy with them.
<br>
<br>
For instance, if a person has guilt issues and gains the ability to psychically heal then when something comes up that they can't heal it will make them feel guilt even more intensely, since they would feel that with their abilities they should have been able to heal it. They would probably conclude that there's something wrong with themselves and that they're worthless and entrench the guilt feelings.
<br>
<br>
But as long as a person is realistic about things and expects to stumble but then learn from the stumblings, these abilities can help to put a person on an exponential path to joy.

It's serious business we are talking about here.
<br>
<br>
- An 'organized' neg council ? which have been feeding information that has much coherence over the last 15 years ? Or negs that have access to info already on the Net and repeating this info --- I have read somewhere that the channeled information that used to be given by Nancy a.k.a Zetatalk was actually 95% old stuff, already available in print or on other sites.
<br>
<br>
- Prediction of a pole shift, AND a stop in the rotation of the planet, so much debris in the air that we will have difficulty to grow plants for 1 to 2 years, necessity to pack foods, and move to a different location, to live in the mountains.
<br>
<br>
- Aliens doing 'genetic enginnering' on us back in the times of the primates, and still now, and what about the LIGHT DNA strand ?..
<br>
<br>
On the other hand : Mayatnik : a 50 years-old man who is almost 100% of times on-line (read : no life), and whose followers are for the most part youngsters. Zetas and Pleiadians providing vague information wrt to personnal AND verifiable matters -- a 'psychic' who does tarot cards would come up with better answers..
<br>
<br>
So what's going on ?
<br>
<br>
If you don't want to post it here, private messaging the people who are concerned will do. It will do for me.
<br>
<br>
Maybe it's true : you have made up your mind about this, and it's better for YOU not to go there now, in the case that you would either be slightly wrong, and/or simply a defective channel (stubborn in your own views) channel, IN THAT CASE.
<br>
<br>
So far God has said that they (Maya, Fuzz, etc.) were definately speaking to 'someone' -- and that 'someone' had no materiality and had decided not to follow God. That seems like you would agree with this. Maybe your channel was colored ? Or maybe you're dead-on ?
<br>
<br>
I am sorry but I am STILL wasting precious time on the Net trying to make sense of it all : Planet X (neburu), Illuminati, Zetas, Grays, ZetaTalk, etc.
<br>
<br>
What you said you would do worked really good Mustardseed, until today. Sorry [B)]

Dear Chill and all
<br>
First of all I would like to apologise if my post offended anyone. Nay sent me a PM and asked if would like to have her approach Adrian about making this thread sticky, so......My suspicion may once again somewhat have been getting the better of me. I apologise.
<br>
<br>
Incidently I prefer it not to be sticky, as it would reflect more truthfully to me if people are at all interested, but for the record I was asked. I thought it would be fair to inform you of this as Nay treated me with more respect in this matter than I did her and the other moderators.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the Zetas and my comment about the channelings, I stand by my opinion, but I do not claim that I channeled this. It is merely my opinion, however since I did channel the comments about the Zetas being in rebellion to god or disbelief I think it was, as Chill so rightly pointed out it could be coloured and influenced by my opinion. Maybe this is indeed the reason why God said for me not to go there. Maybe he knows something I do not.....about me that is[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
].
<br>
<br>
I suppose it is human nature to go where one has been warned not to , just to find out....why not.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again to you all for the input and to you Chill for your observations.

  A question for god.  Do you know what I will become in the future or are you in the present (considering free will and all that)?  How can I become closer to you (I have surrendered myself to you, but I would like to bath in your presence)?  How can I help others find your light?  Who was it that laid their hand upon my head and what did it mean?  I don't understand what you mean when you say have faith.  Shouldn't we know your presence, your existence.  It seems faith is without proof.  Well heck you understand me.

 Hi God above I have put Kuhls questions do you have anything to say
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 as a matter of fact I do have a bit to say to Kuhl
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well good.....we are ready to hear. Honestly I am very interested as well
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Ok them This is going to take some praying for you Kuhl, a bit of reflecting and a lot of humility.......You say That you have surrendered yourself to me .......I say you have not. Now before you start doubting my word let me explain. Surrendering your will to me is not something you do one and for all. It is a daily letting go of your own will. It is what I call a walk of faith. You may have surrendered to me in the past but how about the future?......do you know whether you will turn bitter and stop yielding your life, maybe becourse of some misconcieved idea of your own righteousness or some misplaced notion of how I should do things. This is the walk that you walk by faith, and if you walk the walk then....you can talk the talk. The real surrender is in the little things. Everybody can jump up and down and shout my name from the housetops but the true test of yieldedness is in your surrender to your fellow man, and in this .....your surrender to me. Do you love your neighbour as yourself? do you put others before yourself.... do you in all ways seek humility and submission? . I am sure that if you are honest with yourself you will have to admit that on many occations you fall short. This is where I come in and this is where faith in me and in my ability to transform becomes your salvation. If you trust in me even though you have not yet seen my plan and eventhough you know you have often failed, you will be like one who puts his hand in the hand of a guide trusting him to lead him. This faith is the closeness I seek. I am pleased when you trust me and like a child or lover lean against me and say in your heart, I trust in you and know that you will do me no harm. It is this surrender that shows me you are growing in faith and that gives me the indication that you are ready for the future. I show you also a mystery. I have foreknown you and I have predestined you I am the alpha and omega. The end is as determined as the beginning, but how you arrive at it, wether you are early or late, arrive in rags or fine clothes , that is up to you. I know what you have the potential to become and what you are predestined for but many a prince has tossed their crown to the dust and refused their calling. They are still a prince, but in rebellion. My hand is always on your head, my voice is always in your ear, to whisper softly sweetly patiently.....this is the way ....walk you in it. But the walking is up to you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 brrrr ...that was a lot. I am not going to even read it and see if it makes sense, I cant even remember what I typed I am sust gonna send it before I loose courage....ok?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 just send it
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok
</font>
<br>
<br>
Dear Kuhl This is the longest channeling I have gotten so far I think hope it makes sense to you I am a bit hesitant to send it but ......it is all by faith for me as well. Hope it will be a help to you.

If I surrender myself anymore I should quit school, which is selfish because I am better myself, and live in a homeless shelter helping out the unfortunate, or in some third world country never doing for myself, never speaking above a crowd, afraid to interept because of hurting my neighbors heart.  I will also never tell a joke or tease because it could hurt someones feelings somewhere. I will never get anything done for myself.  If we all lived for a fellow man then we could never learn anything for ourselves and none of the people we serve would "want".
<br>
<br>
I do not shout Gods name on the roof tops.  Nor do I sing Gods praise aloud.  In the past my love for God was weak but is stronger now than it has ever been.  I will not have faith.  I will have knowing. The knowing that God exists and his love is everlasting and ever-encompassing.
<br>
<br>
Either, Mustardseed, you are channeling something other than God or you are simply doing automatic writing, whereas you are letting your subconscious do the work and build a profile based on my posting.  Your post was a direct response to my apparent impatienceness and seeming spiritual development.

You obviously have no idea who I am.

<br>
If I am always to put others first where does God come into the picture?  Second?  Is God the others he is refering to.  I will always put God first regardless of my fellow man because only so much can be done... and no more.  If Jesus had put his fellow man first when men were sinning inside the house of god he would not have ape crazy on them and God definitely wouldn't have summoned Moses to damage the Egyptians.  If God is ever knowing through all times then he should go change what he told Moses to do and instead tell him to love his fellow man and surrender himself to the Egyptians as the Israelites did and were forced to.
<br>
<br>
Write now I am channeling love straight from God.  Tears fill my eyes because of his presence as I write this.  He doesn't doubt my love.

I have had enitities approach me,and they claimed to be certain things.

I have not read the bible for many many years,but I still remember certain things. Such as man cannot look upon the face of God. If humans cannot look upon the face of God,how can they channel him.

God has always spoken to people.  He doesn't have a face, but you can see his presence.

Hi Ken
<br>
If I may direct you to the earlier post of the same nature, we might save ourselves some time. It seems evident that you do not believe and I would not want to waste your time. For the explanation please read the earlier posts on the thread. If that is too much for you, I apologise and will leave it at this. This thread was not set up for me og "He" to try to convince anyone of who or what "he" is. It is for those who have the faith to recieve from Him, and put whatever they "get", to use in their own life.

 it is the way Man reasons. I heard it many times before and it is in error. Being your brothers keeper or loving your neighbour has nothing to do with not telling jokes quitting school etc. That is the misunderstanding. It is taking my words and applying them in the flesh. It is like assuming that being born twice is to enter the sceond time into your mothers womb , that will never happen, it is going away sorrowfully becourse I say eat my body and drink my blod, you must see the spiritual application
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what about the things of Moses
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 he is just being silly and as I said it is hard to recieve and grow at times. Ego gets in the way your own reasoning and any hints that you could be doing things better and that you could be closer to me are hard on the ego. Most people that feel so close to me is really just closer to themself, they think of me as some sort of righteousness they attain, but it is a misunderstanding, he is not the first nor the last to say......"I thank you God that you have made me what I am, I do this I do that I am this I am that, and I am sure thankful I am not like that bad guy there". But I love you all, like a father loves His children, so dont worry"

<font color='"red"'>

 good you are getting more sensitive to the spirit. You have to remember that the one who tells things like they are, the one who questions people and the one who warns people is never going to be popular with people.....but you will have other rewards.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok ...... well I was sort of expecting something else from Kuhl. He seemed to allready believe in you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes....and he does, but self and ego and mans way and understanding is like colored glasses they paint the world in the colour you choose. Familiarity and like being the son or daughter of the teacher, that is always a difficult combination
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so what should I do then
</font>
<br>

  nothing.....relax, take a deep breath....and continue with life
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  and Kuhl?
 </font>
 <br>
 <font color='"blue"'>
  just give him time, you are being impatient....another trait of you all that needs tweaking on a constant basis. I am not in a hurry.When Moses was in a hurry to deliver he slew the egyptian and had to wander 40 years in the desert, things take time. You plant a tree then water it wait for it to grow, like a farmer.....so take time and trust in Me, I can take care of, my own world. I have the whole thing in my hand

This is absolutely ridiculous.  He addressed nothing and his tone was in complete response to the critism that I provided in my previous post.

What does "God" think about his reponses drawing me closer Him but further away from his online personality?

Mustardseed I have a question for you and God...
<br>
<br>
It kind of seems like people who entered this thread with relative openness become upset when God gives them a psychological profile.
<br>
<br>
I would like to know if God would like to tell me what I need to be told.
<br>
<br>
I think I have an idea where I'm lacking, but I would like to know what God has to say and see if it sends me into a rage as well.

<section>
Ha brave heart . Well I cannot rteally do more than write down what I hear. However I am not so surprised at peoples reaction. Most of would prefer God to be just a far distant force and not someone who leads us. It seems that this is the way a lot of us prefer to see Him. It is a bit like the churches and the folks who go there. They seem to prefer a preacher that touches on the principles and just gives a sermon, so they can go ahead the 6 other days of their week and do what they really want. Woe to the preacher or minister that starts mentioning names seeks out the individuals and starts to actually have an opinion and standing up for a certain line of behaviour on anything else but a general plane.
<br>
<br>
This is what I actually liked about RBs books they actually tell it as it is and meddle in peoples life. It seems my "God" does as well and as you will probably note I admit freely that this could be me colouring the channel. However also consider the fact that I might just be in allignment with what I channel.
<br>
<br>
A lot of people have their mind all made up about what they wanna hear. Something similar happened with I think Chill where the message was just sweeter and she reacted in a similar way, thinking that it was too personal or something.
<br>
<br>
As I said to you all. Do not take my word for it. See what it does to you and how you relate. Pray about the answers you get and ask God how it relates to you.
<br>
<br>
Thats all.
<br>
<br>
Prayers to you all.

That reminds me of something else that I've been wondering a lot about. You channeled that "very few people are willing to ask the hard question"
<br>
<br>
I've thought and thought about what could be the hardest question to ask God and haven't come up with much. So, I would like to ask:
<br>
<br>
1.) What do I need to be told about where I'm lacking?
<br>
<br>
2.) What is the hard question that people are not willing to ask?

Dear Kuhl
<br>
I dont know what you refer to as a psychological profile, I never profiled you. I understand from what you mention above, that you set a trap for me so to speak. Well, I covered that in another post a while back, but will reiterate for you. It seems that a lot of people have a expectation of how God should answer. They literally see Him or want Him to be this white haired bearded big guy with a cellphone talking to me. This they ask questions , maybe pretending to be male and they are female and when "He" answers in male they conclude that "He" is wrong and my channel is not God.
<br>
<br>
I have thought a lot about it and asked my channel as well, and got that "he that comes to God for answers must believe that He is and that he is a rewarder of those who dilligently seek Him".
<br>
<br>
You may compare it to some guy taking a taxi, asking the driver to take him to a certain add the driver is unfamiliar with. On the way he gives false information and direction, and ends up in the wrong place. The customer is upset. In this picture I would be the driver God would be the vehicle the power and You would be the passenger. It requires all 3.
<br>
<br>
In order to end up in the right place we all would have to be alligned and the better aligned we are the faster and more direct the route we will be able to take, and the more sure we will be of arriving in the right place. It seems that God uses my intellect, as well as your faith, and I am seemingly unable to channel things I do not understand(fx trapping me with male female giving false information etc).
<br>
<br>
As an example, one might ask me to channel in Swaheli or chineese but I would be unable to do so. It seems that my Faith to recieve, wich is what channeling is all about, would be so hampered by this "impossibility" and that my mind/reasoning/logic would get in the way. A bit like the story of Peter walking on the water. This was only possible as long as he looked at Jesus, and the minute he took his eyes off Him, and started to look at the winds and the waves, his own mind told him he was doing something that was impossible, he started to loose faith in what he was doing and as a result started to sink.
<br>
<br>
I know this is an different concept to the way Mayatnik channels but this is the way I think it works for me. As far as I see it there are no easy answers, and God is only able to speak to you , through Me (in this case) as much as you "pull in the Spirit" and want the answers, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
I am sorry if this is a dissapointment to you. I realise that it would be very neat if I could just pick up the phone and dial GOD, and give you answers to all your questions, in a very personal way, but that seems to me something that only people individually are capable of, making their private Channel totally a hotline between them and Him. Incidently I set up this thread to encourage folks to ask God for themselves things they need to learn and grow, thats is after all what prayer and seeking God is all about.
<br>
<br>
The thread is not set up to somehow exalt Me at all but to encourage YOU to start talking to Him yourself.
<br>
<br>
Hope this makes sense to you, and that it is a help.

Thats ridiculous, you claimed you didn't even know what you wrote to me in the channeled response.  Thats a complete contradiction of what you are saying now.  There would be no way for you to drive me somewhere in a cab if you didn't know the destination, to use your example.
<br>
<br>
It wasn't a trap, but it definitely didn't give you the entire picture.
<br>
<br>
If I was to trick you and lead you to believe that I was a female then I could see how the information might be channeled incorrectly because of the medium, but your personal opinion and first impression of me shouldn't change God's response to me.  All your examples of how channeling works is obvious and extraneous.  I am versed in how channeling take place.  The channel's opinion should not interfere with the response, if it does then you are not channeling but unconsciously giving your opinion.
<br>
<br>
You wrote the same thing over and over again.

Mustardseed,
<br>
<br>
I notice you give a lot of evasive answers. You have not answered me,and it is likely because this being you call God cannot answer.
<br>
<br>
This pattern this entity and yourself are creating is very much like a pattern of a negative. It will only answer questions it thinks it can answer,and yet it ignores questions it knows it cannot answer.
<br>
<br>
I do not believe you are speaking with God or chanelling him. I have seen this many times where a person is told,by something, he or she is talking directly to
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///god.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 God.At
</a>
some point in time the person finds out it is a trickster spirit,ego or the sub-conscious mind.
<br>
<br>
The angels of God work with me,so your chanelled God should be able to shed some light upon my summer of 2000 event if he is really God.

Dear Mustard Seed
<br>
You are doing a good job, I thought you may need to hear this right about now...  this latest barrage of posts have gotten you down.
<br>
<br>
God, thank you for the rainbow today.  Again our teacher let us out of class early, just in time.  The last rays of light were still clinging to the tops of trees and buildings, I moved closer to a clearing from which I could view the sky.  The sun shown through just above the horizon at the exact angle to blazed forth a full double spectrum from one end of the sky to the other.  One rainbow slightly inside the other, clearly separate from it's twin.  *Sigh* It was so beautiful... sadly I noticed that few paused to look.
<br>
<br>
About God, the channelings and people's interpretations...  One must realize that Man is a
<i>
 value assigning agent
</i>
.  When reading peoples responses to Gods words, through the dawning realization that assigning meaning and value is one's
<i>
 own task
</i>
, we can see what is reflected in the mirror of other's hearts.  God's words do sparkle but some choose not to hear it thought they could at any time...  but if they cannot hear it, that is because they have locked their heart.
<br>
<br>
The moment that words reach another person they become 'text.' The letters alone have no meaning by themselves. There is no meaning in the lines alone.  Just like our present selves as multiple facets of a separate entity; we hold no meaning alone.  Surpass the text, then you will be given everything and you will see the true nature of all things.  You have the ability to do so.  This enables one to glimpse the central but undiscovered truth of Self, omnipresent and indestructible, shining behind and beyond the world.
<br>
<br>
Mustard Seed please continue as it would be a waste to stop because of a few people who choose not to hear.
<br>

My line of questioning was not meant to get mustardseed depressed.
<br>
You should understand that I have seen many good people who were lead down the garden path by entities claiming to be God.
<br>
<br>
If mustardseed and this entity were for real, then he would have stayed to respond to the tough line of questioning. By leaving it proves that the entity or whatever it was is not God.
<br>
Besides the answers given were too generic.
<br>
<br>
Blind Faith will always get humans into trouble. Especially when you start to do occult and psychic work.
<br>
You may not want to hear this,but what I am saying is the truth.

Hi Everybody
<br>
Just thought I would pop in and explain that I am not going anywhere, I am not depressed at all. Feeling quite fine actually.
<br>
<br>
My comments are only that I felt that for your sake, that would be Ken and Kuhl, it would be easier if we just did not get into it. It seems that you have allready made up your mind that what I channel is not God, and there is NOTHING that I can do to help you think otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Some people get like that and I think that it is supposed to be that way. If I explain the limits of my channeling and, how the answers depend partly on your faith to recieve, and after I explain to you, what I cannot channel and why, and you still want me to answer how many hairs are on your head and what you did last summer, then.....I give up channeling for you. Then you, and not me have turned this into some sort of hocus pocus fake thing. I actually dont know why I am even writing this, becourse I have a feeling that all I will get back from you is........that is ridiculous .
<br>
<br>
Regards to you all
<br>

Mustardseed

You have brushed my valid concern about that summer aside.
<br>
I was not askng you to tell me what I did that summer as a test.
<br>
I have a valid concern about an event of summer 2000.
<br>
<br>
If you really are talking with God,he would have known the event that still concerns me to this day,and I would have received an answer.
<br>
<br>
I do not care if I get an answer from the entity you are working with now.

<section>
What makes you know without a shadow of a doubt that you are communicating with God?
<br>
<br>
From what you have been saying is that God can't communicate anything to you that you don't already know.
<br>
<br>
Also what is strange is that you both chose to use metaphors.  The bible uses metaphors because people needed something they could relate to.  People of today are able to understand the straight answer.  While you are talking to god you make yourself out to seem very childish, but are obviously intelligent when you post by yourself.

Dear Kuhl
<br>
What makes you think that I "know without a shadow of doubt"[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]. ....I never said that, on the contrary I said I was not sure but I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT. I also said that I have no problem with you NOT BELIEVING IT. Why are you so obsessed with proving me wrong? Has it ever occured to you that I am not interested or trying to convince you at all, nor do I want to change your mind??
<br>
<br>
So my friends do me a big favour. Since you are convinced that I am not Channeling God, stop listening. I was actually in the process of setting up a thread which I wanted to call
<br>
<br>
COMMENTS ABOUT THE CHANNELING GOD THREAD
<br>
<br>
and thought I would ask you to post there, but after being cautioned by a good friend and praying more about it, I changed my mind. I would feel a loss not having it all sort or like a big friendly conversation. God is not like that as far as I know him, but he is all patient sweet kind full of faith and has more patience that we would ever know.
<br>
<br>

 Dear God ....I really need you, please show me how I break out of the pattern I seem to be trapped in, there are so many sweet and kind people out there who truly want to hear from you and who just look with joy, and even humour and delight on this thread. Those are the ones I want to help, but I seem to get trapped into conversations that are full of doubts and harsh words and unkind sentiments.......What do I do
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Like Beth once told you   (she is reading the thread by the way, but she is not letting you know )......take a deep breath.....then relax.....think about what you really believe and what you wanna accomplish and your motive and then..........choose the good and eshew the evil. Ignore it. Go on to the light of a brighter day.  Mustardseed, you have to learn that life is too short to waste on people who live their lives in the shadown who wonder about themselves. You have friends....even people you do not know about but who from their secret chambers strenghten you, I hear their prayers and I hounour them. People want to live in the light they desire good things and I have made you a simple but kind soul to comfort those who are in need and encourage those who have fallen on hard times. So be what I want you to be.{/blue]

<section>
Sorry I posted this question earlier but I still think it is a very good one.  Mustardseed if you please?
<br>
<br>
You say "if two or more are gathered in your name." Well, what about millions of people gathered? You must know about the Coast to Coast AM experiments done with millions of listeners focusing on one thing and perhaps deflecting hurricanes of the East coast. The collective conscious power can be quite large when we are all in agreement on something.
<br>
<br>
So after thinking about all these things, and understanding more just how very much in control of our reality as a collective we have... I began to worry about what today's religions and fears teach people today which is "end times," apocalypse, rapture and dooms day. I think that if these beliefs persist, they may come to pass exactly as people fear. This is all dependent on the finer workings of the collective consciousness, which of course I don't quite understand. Care to delve into this one God?

<section>
To Upset People and MS,
<br>
<br>
Alot of you are already saying and repeating the same things Steel Hawk said,
<br>
'Misleading, and Its not right that your talking to God and I can't!'
<br>
God says quite aften to Meditate, to be closer to him, the closer you are to him, the better he can hear and answer you.
<br>
Mustardseed IS CHANNELING GOD you idiots.
<br>
<br>
BUT I have to defend some people from the Zeta thread, for mustardSeed.  Now take this as polite as possible, I am trying to word it as best I can.
<br>
<br>
But When I was in church, I was trying to make some sort of connection with spiritual growth and christianity.  And without thought, or prior knowledge, they doubted it and said its not something to be getting into.
<br>
<br>
Now I MAY be wrong but, I was thinking about you, and trying to channel myself from things you said on how to do it., and this book i bought.  I herd some things, and came to a conclusion that when a church urges me to swerve in a direction of there belief BEFORE they even puit research on theother side of the subject(Me, and OBE's ext).  but yet, in the back of my mind, its telling me 'Keep going' even though the church is telling me ALL these things about the devil and how its evil.  So think about that.....
<br>
<br>
Another thing mustardSeed, What does God say about buddah? and muhammod? see listen, doesnt God perceive himself differently to all cultures, races? Now wut im trying to get to, and I hope you think about this is, maybe your mind is trying to make you not believe in this stuff, like the church people and myself.
<br>
<br>
If your soooo curious about this, anbd your still new at channeling, maybe you channeled these answers 'DO NOT  talk to zetas' blah blah, maybe thats manifested thoughts.  BUT yet you still have this Temptation to look into it.
<br>
<br>
Im just saying, judge, but judge when you have a good background on both sides.  try it.

There is no way anybody who lives upon this Earth in this age could ever channel God.

I have not read the bible in years,but here is a quote.
<br>
(I Timothy 6:16 Psalm 104:2). The high priest had to shield his eyes, because "no man shall see Me and live."
<br>
So he is unapproachable by a mortal. Then this means it would be impossible to channel his energy through a mortal vessel.
<br>
The ark of the covenant had to be created as a vessel for God,and the ark was made from the purest metal and wood.

Seeing God is much different than having direct communication with him. There were many prophets after Elijah and Abraham who spoke to God on a regular basis. God still speaks to people today, though very few realize it. If Mustard says he talks to God well then who am I or anyone to challenge his experience. It doesn't harm me in any way thus there's really no reason to tear him to shreds.
<br>
<br>
Also, if teh words he says come from God, are wise and loving then what does it matter who it comes from.

Hi Ken, you might be surprised to know that in the Bible God appears three times in human form to various people.
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.donmeh-west.com/ToDie.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.donmeh-west.com/ToDie.shtml
</a>
<br>
"Nevertheless, Yahweh took human form at least three times in the Old Testament: first to Abraham at the Oak of Mamre (Gn 18:1-5); second, to Moses on Mount Sinai (Ex 34:6-9); and third, to the Community of Israel in the desert (Dt 5:24). Moreover, concerning the apparition at Mamre, rabbinic tradition holds that "Yahweh personally appeared [as a man] to Abraham" (The Midrash Says, Vol. 1, p. 159), and there is a Talmudic dictum that Yahweh himself will come as the Jewish Messiah. "
<br>
<br>
And also don't forget that it is widely believed that the Bible is the Word of God (i.e. whoever wrote it must have channeled God).
<br>
<br>
Now i'm not saying this proves Mustardseed is channeling God, just providing info is all. [

That's why discernment is needed. I've read enough of Mustards posts to tell that he is very discerning in regards to spirits. He has an open mind, yet remains scepticla about certain things.
<br>
<br>
I would compare his mind to a screen door. It let's in the refreshing breeze but keeps the flies out.

<br>
My point is that to channel the christian/jewish God it would appear a person would need to be very very pure. Likely a mortal would need to abstain from sex. Be pure of mind,body and spirit. It is not likely that such a person exists in this age who would really fit the bill.
<br>
<br>
The answers are too genreic. My question was brushed aside.
<br>
No this "God" is not cool. I do not like its tone or its threats.
<br>
<br>
I would like to ask the christian/jewish God about the incest problem to due with the Noah's Ark story.
<br>
Only Noah his wife and his son's and their wives were chosen. Then the offspring of these unions will be brothers,sisters and first cousins. A few generations down the road humans would have become sterile,which is what incest causes eventually. Then kaputt.
<br>
<br>
and this
<br>
<br>
When God destroyed that race of men, he also destroyed innocent babies and the innocent animals that were not aboard the ark.
<br>
<br>
and this
<br>
<br>
Why is the Catholic church allowed to continue to exist when more reports of pedophiles come from that church than any other christian church?
<br>
<br>
Would I get answers? Not likely.

Ken... you and I both know he isn't channeling god, at least not completely, but leave it alone.  It most certainly isn't helping anyone by getting so upset.
<br>
<br>
Don't try to analyze the Bible its not meant to be taken literally, and yes it contradicts itself for various reasons, mostly human error and misinterpretation.
<br>
<br>
I personally know God doesn't want us to have faith, but a ever growing knowledge of Him.  We learn from our experiences and those who have came before that were at the end of their spiritual road (Jesus, Buddha, maybe Gandhi).
<br>
<br>
The fact alone that Musterseed's god wants us to believe in blind faith, and not to mention the contradictions, whether you picked them up or not they are there, is reason for me to believe that something is seriously wrong.
<br>
<br>
I might post more on this later.  It seems no one is listening, but...

<section>
rhinegirl,
<br>
<br>
I doubt if God is anything like what he is depicted like in the bible.
<br>
After all it is quite evident the men who wrote the bible also had a strong dislike of women. Human females were blamed for gettng the human race cast out of eden.
<br>
<br>
I have read a story about the God Jupiter,which is similar to the flood story in the bible. Only Jupiter caused a flood because those humans did not have the desire to worship Gods or Goddess. Hard to say if it's true.
<br>
<br>
I have seen other flood stories,but they could be metaphors.
<br>
<br>
Kuhl is likely correct,and I should stop adding to this thread.
<br>
<br>
There are only a few things I think that can be taken literally in the bible. The stories of Jesus. Especially stories about his powers.
<br>
Other stories involving great powers or artifacts of great power mentioned in the bible. The stories of the wars.

Hello God,
<br>
It's been great to feel this love inside me tonight. The realization that it is all that matters : seeing happy faces, all around, sharing good times.
<br>
<br>
Nice one on one - me makes 3 - encounter between my father and his mother, after 3 years of not seing one another. It all went smoothly, both were happy when it was done, I think.
<br>
<br>
Even if my grandmother had trouble most of the time to differentiate my father from her other son Denis (because of alzheimer disease), it was normal, since my father has not seen her for such a long time.
<br>
<br>
[edit sentimentality and edit of all thanks that are not deserved, after all : you're not responsible for all that is good... we are too, as human beings]
<br>
<br>
ok, I spoiled it.
<br>
<br>
Make my cold go away please.
<br>
<br>
please

<section>
1) How is one person's faith tested?
<br>
Faith is not relevant when dealing with god and should be discouraged.
<br>
<br>
2) Is it true God urges all man to meditate to be closer to Him? and what benefits you from doing this? Can you say some examples? MS can you state some scriptures or something to help me understand more, lol im alittle slow hah
<br>
<br>
Yes God urges all men to meditate.  It brings us closer to our subconscious, which is our soul and our super consciousness which is our spirit.  Our soul holds the accumlation of all past experiences and all past personalities.  The spirit is our oneness with God.
<br>
Read some Gnostic texts and don't believe anyone who says the text is heresy.  The Gnostic texts were written before the scriptures of the Bible were put together.
<br>
<br>
3) Why does the bible talk soo badly about 'whitchcraft' 'speaking to the dead' 'mediums being bad', When The bible promotes soo strongly about spiritual growth?
<br>
<br>
The bible doesn't talk... I mean really talk...  People often get this point confused.  If the Bible is talking and people begin to believe the bible is the word of God the only word, but these words came from men's mouths and fingertips. This is especially true with the New Testament.
<br>
It was a man or a group of men who added the words about mediums to discourage humans from finding the true light.  If men were to live to learn and not rely on faith then the Church would lose its power.  Men would experience the true nature of the Christ and God and the process that our soul goes through until it reaches oneness with God, which obviously covers death and rebirth.
<br>
<br>
Yes I know I am not God, but I can assure that my answer will be more satisfactory than the one Mustardseen provides.

actually, i apologize for not stateing 'who'. You have put your comments in a non-aggresive manner, so you are fine but also, say what you need to say and move on, is there any reason to keep saying how mustardseed is 'not channeling god' and 'channeling the zetas' are.  Infact, your on this site for a reason, for SOME kind of paranormal gift, activity interests you.  Now think about this. . . If people can make PSI BALLS, or move PENCILS with there mind, and Project to a 'ASTRAL WORLD' lol hah why is channeling God any Different?  seriously think reasonable here! hah  go talk to some random guy and ask 'Hey do you believe people can move things with there mind?'  they'll say NO.
<br>
<br>
Ask most people with some brains, 'You believe in God' and if Yes, you ask 'Do you believe you can speak with God?' most will say YES
<br>
<br>
hah  Most of all the world believe in some kind of God, and I bet you most of them say they communicate some how with him.
<br>
<br>
Why do people at church grow weak and colapse when they say God is with them? Most christians will say they talk with God all the time, just some people never really went to 3rd base with it like mustardseed is doing.  Though everyone can if they tried.
<br>
<br>
Like with telekinesis, youll do it once you 'have faith' that you can do it.

You'll speak with God once you 'have faith' that you can do it.

Not everyone can go to "third base", as you inappropriately refered to it, with God.  It takes careful meditation,practice, and a change in character.

<br>
I'll state it again incase you aren't reading the entire post, like you did my last 2, faith can only take you so far with God, and its not enough.

If you want to read some actual channelings from the Oneness read some Edgar Cayce material.  Now that man had actual proof of his link.

How is one person's faith tested?
<br>
<br>

 Faith is tested when things happen that you feel were not fair. If you thought I led you to do certain things and then they did not work out. If you married a person and felt it was my will and then you end up splitting up, when you are judging me and I say to you.....trust me
 <br>
 , and trust that I can bring a victory from a seeming defeat. My greatest victories comes from the mightiest battles and out of some of the deepest and darkest experiences arise some of the most precious lessons you ever learn ....IF you trust that I can bring the victory, defeat the impossible foe and that you through me can bear the unbearable burden, and that all things work together for good to them that love me.....all things. That takes faith to believe and when you have that kind of faith or even seek it ....it pleases me.

 Meditate, think, reflect, consentrate, consider, meditate on my word, think on my righteousness, consentrate on your blessings ,  consider those that are worse off than you, think of how you would be without me.

Why does the bible talk soo badly

<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I am the way the truth and the life, if any man comes unto me in me he is blessed. If some desire spiritual gifts without my power without being ready he is running ahead of me and himself. That is all. Witchcraft is wanting so much to know, but not wanting to learn the lessons that gives the knowledge. The benefit without paying the price. All meat and no potatoes. I love it when a honest soul seeks to know me. When they come to me becourse they have a desperate heart I answer them , but when people use my power for their own benefit, to hinder to harm or to teach things I never said.....I am sad. I have a plan for all....but some do not trust my timing , but in rebellion and stubbornness they run ahead of me, and seek their own way and their own way brings them many sorrows, for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry

Now the following is taken from one of Mustardseed's posts in the Proof of God's existence thread, posted on December 6th - read what's in bold, I think he's quoting the OT :
<br>
<br>
<font color='"maroon"'>
 « Personally I remain sceptic about witcraft etc but find it interesting that the Prophet compares witchcraft with
 <b>
  stubbornness and other rebellious acts
 </b>
 .
 <br>
 <br>
 "
 <b>
  to obey is better than sacrefice and to listen than the fat of rams, for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as idolatry and iniquity
 </b>
 "
 <br>
 <br>
 It seems to me that in those days there was a possibility that Gods message could be confused with the Devils, and God had to have very strict guidelines. He also at that time recommended that a child or teenager who was disrespectfull against his /her parents or a woman taken in adultery was taken without the gates and stoned to death! Something I do not expect you to adhere to!!
 <br>
 <br>
 This may be an indication that they at that time had no real dicernment. Jesus was not yet crucified and the HOLY SPIRIT WAS NOT YET GIVEN. !!!

Everyone channels the feelings of god, not everyone listens and some can hear and feel it better than others because of practice and natural ability.

God works through men, but only the one that are susceptible.  He expects you to do for yourself and others, and if your relationship with God is firm then he will give the strength to overcome obstacles that are outside your ability.

That would be a good question for God :
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Is there such thing as the Akashic record ?
</b>
Pleiadians and Zetas obviously have no access to this library, if such a library exists. They are clueless about any individual's past, present, and future, except perhapse the ones that are channeling them. In this case, we would presume that one is not channeling oneself, of course. My own independant study proved that those aliens were clueless, which was a relief for me.

Of course the aliens are clueless. Just because someones from a different planet doesn't mean they have all the answers.

There is an Akashic library. Odin brought me to it once...he wouldn't let me see my own book, though I did see several others.

How do you come to this conclusion? Supposing the Zeta and Pleiadian channelings are real, as you do in this example, there have been some things channeled that contradict this. I remember way back in some of the earliest Zeta/Pleiadian posts, reference to the akashic records was made, but they didn't really use that name, but maybe said that it was the same thing as what they were referring to. The channelings said that they had access to the records, but since many were and are personal, they can only be accessed and discussed in certain instances.
<br>
<br>
Recent example:
<br>
<br>
SeventhVirgo: Considering my experiences from childhood... I don't think it was a coinsidence to have bumped into this forum. My friend, told me about OBE/Entities/ExtraTerrestrials/etc... As most people, I was skeptical at first, and made fun of him... but later started being interested in it. Was I meant to meet hiim? Because he has changed the way I think about life... and I guess I am now more "enlightened," than before.
<br>
<br>
Z: The meeting with him was not incidental as you have met each other before in a previous life. There are often souls who meet each other through the course of time to help and influence each other. You could call this a lifelong friendship which happens to go beyond a single life. Its typical that lives are interconnected like this, because of the many benifits that lies in this sort of making lives. So all in all there are an interest to connect through several lives in the hope of exchanging knowledge and help one another.
<br>
<br>
Info was also channeled on a couple dreams, and the energy work of one member if I remember correctly. Just scroll through the Zeta Channeling topic.

Considerations regarding my channelings.
<br>
<br>
Dear friends
<br>
I have read your comments with great interests and do appreciate everyones effort and thoughts. I especially found some comments Kuhl made to be very thought provoking and would like to let you all know my comments on his points. In order to get this out I am gonna just let it rip, ok? I may not be too polite and may not be too politically correct either. Please bear with me and if you have the desire reply please do so, to what I say, not how it was said. Thankyou for your cooperation.
<br>
<br>
Kuhl mentioned that he thought I had just read the old testament,  by how I sounded.
<br>
<br>
The reality is that when I "got saved" at about 21, I read nothing but the Bible for most of 10 years. (New and Old.) I Memorized several books and numerous Chapters and spent hours and days in prayer. I never looked back and had very little "worldly input" through those years. Most of my energy was spent in telling people about Jesus. I was and still is ......a FANATIC. I figure that if there is a God and if he is real and worth serving he is worth serving all the way....full time and FANATICALLY.
<br>
<br>
However....my spiritual life (in regards to OBEs and so forth)continued in a different more diverse direction. I realised that the Churches were so......wrong and more in tune with the dark forces and that my faith was MINE alone. God was and still is, real to me,  as real as McDonalds is to you........I think about him all the time and live for him day to day. The Lord (as I call Him) was so kind as to give me a wife who had the same attitude, and we progress together. She is very physical, and have no OBEs or anything else. She is an artist but is spiritually able to grasp that I am on a quest.
<br>
<br>
(Jeff, it is worth it to be together in Spirit, but the longer you put it off the harder it will be to tell you are not ......like everyone else[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
])
<br>
<br>
So all that to say......YES I also am surprised that "God", sounds like me, that He and I think alike, and use the same vocabulary. But remember we have been intimately involved for a number of years and know each other well[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
].
<br>
<br>
For all of you who believe me to be a nutcase, I have no problem with that at all.......just remember this is a free world......I can do and say and believe anything I want...you have that freedom as well and if you want it you have to extend it to me.
<br>
<br>
Thankyou for the time.
<br>
<br>
The next Channeling will be about :
<br>
<br>
The Aksahic records and wether they exist,
<br>
<br>
Fishing
<br>
<br>
Loneliness
<br>
<br>
Suffering
<br>
<br>
Mel Gibsons the Passion
<br>
<br>
Thankyou for spending your time here
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

<br>
I'd like to add something. Something about a 'nice' coincidence.
<br>
Someone in this thread gave the link to another thread, quite a lenghty one. I scanned through that other thread very quickly and some words hit home more than others. Once back to this thread I read the new post from Mustardseed which a part of sounded like something I'd just read, something that had stuck. So I go back to the other thread (Proof of God), and find the excerpt, make a mental connection to what was said about Mustardseed sounding like the OT, then felt that it was important to corroborate that - maybe because of this whole coincidence. I don't know the Old Testament. So I did not recognize similarities up to this point. And from the NT, I read only the Luke,... 4 ones. I knew that it would make Mustardseed react, so why did I do that ? It was not an act of defiance, yet I knew he could *get* it that way. I did post it anyway, then got soooo worried afterwards. But did not remove it. I am happy that you don't seem upset at me Mustardseed. I am glad that you had this 'talk' out though, I think it's normal that you are to use simlar wordings if you did read the OT to such extent.
<br>
<br>
And it's o.k. in your case to be 'fanatic'. You are not lukewarm.
<br>
<br>
And you are ready to tell all what your convictions are (unlike me, who just this afternoon told 2 girls who asked if I was a believer - they said they weren't - "yes... but how can you live with the death of a close one if you don't believe that there's a God to look after them, life after death..?" I excused myself for my belief !! When, in fact, I beleive because I do, there are no 'psychological justifications', I don't NEED to belief, and as a matter of fact, I often think I would be better off NOT beleiving, and sometimes even hope for the day when I will 'grow out' of my faith, yet I do believe.
<br>
<br>
No it's fine NOT to be lukewarm about these things. AS you are not a 'bigot'.

<br>
<br>
SeventhVirgo was told that he met his friend in another life ? That friend who lead him to the subjects of Entities/ExtraTerrestrials ?
<br>
This is a classic. The psychics consulted by my friends and by my family always pull that one off... « you met this person in a previous life » concerning a close family member or a boyfriend or an ex-boyfriend, or a girlfriend or an ex-girlfriend, or anyone they are particularly close to, or have been close to. Then they think : « wow, that explains it », « it's like I have known this person before », or « it's because I met this person that I came to » blabla.
<br>
<br>
In this case that friend lead SeventhVirgo to the Zetas/Pleiadians. They knocked the nail further down with a « past life » free of charge comment. Free of charge = not verifiable.
<br>
<br>
I did not read the posts on the dreams, and energy work. All I can tell you, noleafclover, is that from my own independant study the Pleiadians and Zetas are really clueless about people other than the ones who allow the channeling to take place through them.

I know this sounds pretty ridiculous, with all my questioning and all, but I thought I would ask "God" how Jesus acquired his abilities, who opened them up to him?  What did he do for the beginning years of his life.  How many more people since Jesus have had the Christ spirit?

<section>
hi mustardseed and god,
<br>
<br>
here's a few questions the answers to which i'd be interested in:
<br>
<br>
1)  which god are you?  i'm asking this one from a technical / metaphysical / OBE perspective here, rather than from a philosophical / metaphysical / theological perspective.  basically, in my mystical work and experinece i've travelled up through the planes of the reality and met all the lords of the planes up to the source.  it is these lords of the planes which, by most mystics and religions, are considered to be "god" as it were, though each lord of a plane is in fact the entirety of that plane itself, eg the lord of the causal plane is also the causal plane itself.  further, each higher plane contains all lower planes within itself, eg the causal plane contains the astral plane and the physical plane within itself also.  though that's not quite the full picture on that last point.  anyway, for more full take on what, in my experience, god is, check out my thread "Esoteric/Spiritual Authority and The Nature of God" located here:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.occultforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=8563&amp;highlight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.occultforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=8563&amp;highlight=
</a>
<br>
<br>
it's basically more or less the same outline as presented in the sikh religion and in the san mat system of guided spirit travel.  at any rate, you say that your nature is LOVE, which would, on the basis of logic rather than intuition in this case, indicate that you're probably either sach kand, the first plane above the great void (whose nature is pure love) or kal niranjan, the lord of the causal plane, who also usually describes his nature as love.  but then again, so do all lords of planes below sach kand (for such is indeed the case as sach kand set the projection of the creation below it up so that its (the creation's) nature, at a deep level, would be its (sach kand's) own nature, viz love; those lords of planes above sach kand don't describe their nature as love for the simple reason that at their level love does not exist, it being an expression of Nam only at and below the level of sach kand, for it is at that level / stage of creation that love came into existence.
<br>
so, to cut a long stroy short: which one are you?
<br>
<br>
2) what is your purpose in communicating so publicly with humanity at this point in human history?
<br>
<br>
3) what is your take on Revelations and Daniel 7?  who is the whore of babylon, who is the second beast and who is the lamb?  are we currently in "the end of days" or we are about to soon (next 3-4 years) enter them?  will there be widespread death and destruction or has humanity evolved enough for that possibility to be avoided?  what is the nature of judgement day?  also, what's your take on the bible code and the predictions contained in there?
<br>
<br>
okeys, thanks guys.
<br>
<br>
all the best,
<br>
Oazaki.

 yes

 do you know allready

 yes ........ofcourse, but for everyone elses sake you better ask anyway

 ok.....whats the big deal about the channeling and the people who have gotten sick, and what should I do about the questions regarding "what God " you are. This guy seems to have a lot of experience with all sort of spiritual things and met a lot of entities and stuf
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ok.....lets talk about words then. Words are real things, the curse or bless lift up or knock down. Without discernment to judge the spirits you could curse or and bless the wrong people. Your words have power , actual creative spiritual power, the tounge of man is the most powerful force in the universe , becourse in it is imbedded .....free will. With the tounge you can curse man and bless man, the tounge is an unruly evil and without being tempered by my Spirit it will and have set the world on fire

 but what does that have to do with the thread and the sick channeler

 really really....you have been there

 well sometimes I just get discouraged when people are mean

 that is a curse and if you were not under the forcefield of my love you would really get affected

 so that is bad then
</font>
<br>

 that all depends on who curses who and who blesses who. If you bless someone who is doing a bad thing you become partaker of his evil deed. In a way you empower him, if you curse someone who is doing his best to stay close to me you are hindering someones faith and this is not pleasing to me.....by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned. You all live very important lifes, if you accept it and a lot hinges on you, you have been given the potential to wield the keys to the kingdom, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven and what you bind with your words here will be bound in the spirit there.

 wow interesting........so was it good for them to do that to the channeler

 what about the guy with all the questions

<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 tell him that you will ask me his questions after he has read the thread. He likes the easy way out. But there shall be no answer given to him as of yet, for his mind is full of his own ways and he assumes himself to be a mighty, as I said before I will feed the hungry but the full I will send emty on their way. Full of their own ways. The danger is pride arrogance and the evil way. One day he will know of what I speak, but he is yet entrenched in his own preceptions and his heart is as a stone, but he is still young

 I have a bit of a problem with that.......he might get upset

 live with it Mustardseed, and deal with it, will you obey man or me. Watch out you do not become a manpleaser seeking to only give pleasant messages......speak when and what I tell you to speak and leave the rest to me

The main problem with the concept of being saved is this.
<br>
Each and every being on this Earth lived in the spirit world long before the physical universe was even thought of or created;therefore,once your physical form dies your spirit form goes back to the spirit world where you came from in the first place.
<br>
<br>
WitchCraft.You have no understanding of what modern witchcraft or spellcraft is. It is the use or manipulation of energy to cause something to happen that is of benefit to the spellcaster as well as anybody who the spellcaster might be healing or helping.
<br>
The awakening of certain chakras also allows a person to manipulate energy. These are not paranormal things. The chakras are natural things,which are a part of the spirit bodies.
<br>
Channeling is not a natural thing. To allow another spirit entrance to your body is dangerous as well. Channeling is a lot like playing with a ouija board or some other dangerous occult tool.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Christians will be surprised at what they see when they go to the astral dimension. The spirit world is nothing like what the christian churches teach it is like.
<br>
Most people go to the astral dimension. Some go to higher levels in the spirit world,which are above the astral.
<br>
There are hundreds of thousands of dimensions to go to after this Earthly life is over.

Dear Sara
<br>
I will answer this one myself so we can somehow define your question a bit more. Yes it is idolatry by definition......if he is represented by a idol that is. However it is also idolatry to worship any other idol. God is not a  statue,nor does he live in a statue. Masses of people worship idols, they believe that sacrefice to the spirits that live in certain idols statues can somehow grant them their wishes. In a sense the greatest idolaters are the Christians who believe that going to church is somehow worshipping God. Now mind you, this is the ones who believe that the moving of their physical body in to a church building is somehow beneficial to them or brings them closer to God. They actually believe he lives in the Church building. This is idolatry. Then there are the ones worshipping their cars computers and on and on.

ROFLMAO!! It has EVERYTHING to do with this thread. Your tribal god Jehovaphat says we must be saved. Remove the concept of SALVATION and any need for your paultry little deity goes out the window.
<br>
<br>
Your godfly only says to serve him and then he promises heaven, this is akin to trusting a madman to give hinm teh knife because he promises that he won't cut you. It"s ridiculous!!!!
<br>
<br>
I have a few questions for your little god and he better answer them and not skirt around the issue.
<br>
<br>
#1. Biblical and archeological scholars have discovered that you were once a minor tribal deity who rose into the majority once the assyrians kicked the Hebrews butts. So how does it feel knowing that you have such humble origins. Are you thankful for that?
<br>
<br>
#2. The movie Jesus De Montreal speaks various things which the church regards as heresay such as Jesus's birth father and other bits which I'm sure you already know about because your god and know and see all.
<br>
<br>
#3. How do you feel about teh fact that people are still focusing on the gruesome death of jesus rather than the life of jesus during moments in which he healed people or threw out the money lenders?
<br>
<br>
#4. How do you feel about Mel Gibsons website related to his movie which sells gaudy nail necklaces and coffee mugs. Isn't this turning Jesus's message into Capitalistic Consumerist GARBAGE???
<br>
<br>
I look forward to your answers you who was once a minor tribal deity.
<br>
<br>
JESICA

<br>
<br>
looks like you're not willing to play my little game here and i'll tell you straight that i'm not going to play yours.  so let's be direct and honest with each other here shall we?
<br>
<br>
"god", be aware as to whom you are speaking here.  i will NOT kneel down before you nor give you my power.  i don't do that for anyone.  though i do work within the laws of creation.  and i have, as i said above, already met the various aspects of god (ie lords of planes) so, to be clear on this matter, i know to whom i am speaking here and what his nature is.  i will also add that you can come forth yourself on this or i can reveal and illustrate it myself.  the beneficial, accurate advice and insight you have given is fine.  you've done a good job there and kudos to you mustardseed for actually being open enough to channel an entity with much accurate insight into how the creation actually works and is set up.  but be aware that not all his stuff is accurate and he is not what he claims.  anyway, back to you "god". know that, at this stage in mankind's evolution, i'm not willing to have humanity fed inaccurate stuff purporting to be from the godhead itself, especially if said stuff serves to hold humanity back from its full potential.
<br>
<br>
and before you all jump on me for criticizing here, that's not what i'm doing.  i'm pointing out what (i believe) to be the case here, highlighting the facts that:
<br>
1) "god" *does* have significant accurate insight into GOD's laws and how the creation works
<br>
2) "god" is not God.
<br>
3) people should be critical of who they channel and investigate whether the entity being channeled is in fact who he claims to be.  said investigation, of course, being based on more than just asking the entity himself if he is who he says he is...
<br>
<br>
and also, i'm giving "god" the oppurtunity to come clean for himself as to his true nature and purpose here.  and i'm also saying that if he doesn't then i'll reveal the falsity of his claims through pointing the flaws in his stuff and the areas where his understanding is limited and where, consequently, he has misportrayed the facts of the matter.  which, believe me, is probably the kindest, most gentle way to go about this of the options open before me.  see how nice and courteous i'm being to you "god"?  after all, you're not malicious and deceiving like some of those other entities being channeled here.  you're just playing a more involved game than you've so far let on...
<br>
<br>
all the best guys,
<br>
Oazaki.

this "god" has already proven it's nature in its actions of answering some questions and the way it avoids others. Notice how its knowledge stops where Mustards stops? I grow weary of this game!!![|)].  I henceforth call upon the power of Odin and Loki to force this jehovaphat to give us straight answers and stop hiding behind semantics!!!!!!

yeah, but that's how channelling (as opposed to, for example, possession, telepathic communication, meditation, OBE contact, etc) works.  the chanelled entity can't fetch thru any information not, in some way, already known by the chaneller.  however, by connecting the logical dots amongst the chaneller's own knowledge, and further by approaching what the channeler already knows from a different persepective, many new insights can be revealed.  but yeah, the chanelled entity does have to work within the context of the chaneller's knowledge, abilities and even, to an extent, belief structure.  hence why you can't get things like the time-series equations for the motion of this solar system's as-yet undiscovered planets thru channeling.  though you can get such info thru mediation and psychic perception (Nibiru ephemeris anyone?).  but bear in mind, that if you do get such info thru meditation or psychic perception you'd still have to put it into a form accessible by your own conscious awareness (eg standard mathematical notation).  so, there too, you'd be somewhat limited by your own current state of knowledge and would have to develop and increase said knowledge to actually progress (which, usually, you can also do thru mediation etc).  same with channeling: to actually go further you have to find your own answers, rather than seek to get them given to you.  remember: each is responsible for their own spiritual and he who seeks to walk a path laid out for him by another will never find himself or realize his own purpose and destiny in life.

Thankyou for explaining that Oazaki. You have just said it in words I could never use, as they are not "mine". Just to assure you that I am not playing a game, believe me that allthough I claim / believe I am channeling God, I do not force anyone to believe it, nor do I claim more closeness to God than anyone else. "God" and myself have gone over that several times on the thread and I expect that this is the reason he is asking you to read it before answering your questions. I actually felt a bit hesitant to channel anything even slightly negative and it caused me some grief , but I chose to anyway, hoping you would be able to just think of the input as just an opinion. Thanks for taking the time to write that if you do not mind I will referance this post to anyone who asks similar questions.

Dear Rhinegirl
<br>
I must admit that I hesitate to ask your questions, and that is my perogative. One of the reasons is that allthough neither "God" or I are afraid of you, you come across very agressive and self confident. Generally this attitude seem to somewhat obscur my channeling, or colour it . I am not sure why this is. I will pray about it a bit more. Thanks for your input anyway.

You say that neither you or god are afraid of me. Well perhaps the entity you channel IS! I am self-confident and the fact that it colours your channelings shows that you yourself need a lot more practice...no offense, that came out harsher than it was meant.

Hi Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
I would love you to get back to the subjects you said you would ask questions about, please : suffering, loneliness, the film The Passion of Christ, fishing, etc.
<br>
<br>
And with this *bonus* question : if we were to assume that Mel Gibson was inspired by the Holy Spirit for the making of this movie -or rather for this movie to be done, and done so with extreme violence (so being realistic in its depiction, not leaving anything to the imagination, showing it all) and a focus on how collectively we can be quickly and easily led to an all-against-one hatred, against someone who was only guilty of ... what exactly? then why is there so much controversy created by the media, why SOME people here where I live even talk about "propaganda" and "christian fondamentalism". Anyway I'll go see the movie. I think that I will love it. Maybe I won't at all, we'll see.
<br>
<br>
Also thank God for leading me to watch the film 'Capturing the Friedmans'. Excellent documentary film.
<br>
<br>
Oh. Please watch over what I am doing, this project. I don't want get into details, and I would appreciate that you Mustardseed don't either. It's just a request for help that I am voicing. I am not the only one involved, so much effort and money will be spent by so many people, I would like my collegues to get something out of it, and the experience to be a blessing overall. Even if I feel I have the wrong subject, maybe it can be twisted, find its way, it's too late now, and I wouldn't change from it, strangely, even if I had the time, there is *something* there.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all those people who read my praying thread, which was moved to the healing section. It should perhapse have been moved to the religious section, as I am not asking for the help of healers, but for ordinary people, you and me, to pray for the channelers.

Hi Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
I would love you to get back to the subjects you said you would ask questions about, please : the film The Passion of Christ,
<br>
<br>
[:I]Not untill he answers mine about Jesus De Montreal
<br>
<br>
And with this *bonus* question : if we were to assume that Mel Gibson was inspired by the Holy Spirit for the making of this movie
<br>
<br>
[:I]Mel was inspired by his gargantuous ego and his thoughts about making a profit.
<br>
<br>
pray for the channelers.
<br>
<br>
 [:I]yes pray that they seek psychiatric help....some actually do need it. Odin told me so himself.

We all have a gargantuous ego from time to time. And you definately need one in order to write/direct a movie - to get all those people involved in your artistic vision. Or maybe not, I am not sure. In this case, Gibson invested his own money, but that doesn't say anything about his ego, positive or negative, it only says something about how *badly* he wanted the film to be made, the way he wanted it to be made, and maybe it says something about how confident (realistically confident) he was that the movie would make enough money.
<br>
<br>
Jésus de Montréal is a good film. You watched it ?
<br>
You sound like someone who's not from Germany.
<br>
<br>
Odin told you ? Maybe you are channeling godliness too [

Dear Rhinegirl
<br>
If you insist on your agression I will have to ignore you. As far as straight talk I do not need god to help me on this one. [

Please try to understand that the very notion (idea) that anyone.......anyone at all on the astral pulse or "God" where ever he is , should be afraid of you is ludicrus.
<br>
<br>
It only serves to show to everyone your thoughts and high opinions of yourself as well as make people ignore your posts . That is all you gain. Is it worth it?

<section>
Ok I will be honest with you then. First of all I edited my post as I felt I was being a bit too sensitive about it and that asking Nay to interfere was a bit....high handed. Maybe we should chat a bit instead.
<br>
<br>
You asked for my honesty and I will give you that. Generally I am a pretty decent fellow, and have friends all over the world who would go far to help me if I needed their help. Why is that ? I am not perfect by no means but I dont beat my wife, shout at my kids or set the dog on the mail man. I have learned from my almost 50 years in this world that what you give out in this world has a way of returning to you. Unkind words and inconsiderate agressions on my part fx. here on the pulse, have come back not only, in more agression from others but also in my life away from the pulse. People choose where they want to live their life, in the sunshine or in the shadows. A man that wants friends must show himself friendly. Now before you shout that you dont need noone and dont care about friends........think about it a bit.
<br>
<br>
I would say that allthough you seem to be a very bright and persuasive girl, and have many very interesting observations to add, largely you tend to carry a negative attitude and speak in a very agressive mode. This will come back to you. People (like me) will start to ignore you. Noone will really enjoy your company and you will be ......... alone.
<br>
<br>
Like many other things you are faced with a choice. If you believe that you alone have all the answers....keep going in the same way and alianate people one after one.......or lighten up....take a bit of honest correction, that honestly is only meant to help you and just try to be the nice german brunheld warrior you have the potential to be. Emphasis on NICE[

First of all I am NOT a little brat. Askiing questions does not mean that I do not accept God. I am simply questioning the validity of Mustards claims that he is channeling god. Thus I ask for answers.
<br>
I will not behave like some milqtoast sheep before some words that are supposedly from god. I face my gods, I don't and will NEVER bow to any deity.

 Channeling God
</span>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 God ...do you have something to say?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Mustardseed...do you have something to ask?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 Yes I do......I want to ask you about Jess and about all the other things suffering loneliness mell Gibson and Fishing and all that as well
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 OK then.......Suffering is good for you, it brings out the best in you and have many many benefits......IF.......it is the right suffering.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 is there a wrong suffering
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes.....when people suffer needlessly when people start to get the idea that the suffering in itself is the goal and when people forget that it is not the suffering but the lessons learned from the suffering that helps you. It is another form of idolatry. People whipping themselves, suffering pain and hurt thinking that that will bring them closer to me. Crueling hours of joyless meditation, crawling on hands and knees the world is full of it
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok but what is the right suffering then
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 when you allow me to break you, when you submit to my will in your life, when you learn to see the lesson in the things that happen to you. Some people just do not want to yield they say "my head is bloody but unbowed" they suffer needlessly only to find in the end that a life lived in pride like that leads nowhere. Pride has no benefit in my realm, but is a tool of darkness to enslave humanity.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 and what about loneliness
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it is very similar......it can be a blessing and a curse. Some are lonely becourse I have moved that way in their life and allowed them to be alone and I will teach them and be their friend partner father or mother if they call out to me......but others will be and stay lonely for the wrong reason and will not benefit at all. They are lonely becourse of their actions words and thoughts and are in a sense their own punishment. Hell will be a continuation of the selfish self centered lives people are allready living here and heaven will be acontinued life of joy love and kindness that is chosen and empowered my me for others.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what about Mel Gibson and his film
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 He thinks a lot about me and has tried his best to be honest and tell a story that he believes should be told
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 is the film an accurate account
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it is close enough for you to get the point, thats all that matters
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 Ok thanks........anything else
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 you are welcome......why wont you go see it
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I dont like blood and violence I have seen too much in real life
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 reconsider.........you could learn some
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok I will think about it Bye for now

<br>
good.  another one sees the way with clarity.
<br>
<br>
and *that* "god" is the essence of why i will not allow all this "bow down to me and submit to my will" stuff.  you're saying it unqualified.  certainly, the laws of creation should be obeyed, but not because they are god's will but because by so obeying them you can effect your own will far more effectively than through any other means.  i would also add that in this context i obey and use GOD's laws for the ultimate aim and purpose of redfining/changing those laws themselves.  yes it's a revolution against GOD (or, more accurately, against some of his aspects).  for light and dark are uniting and the tao is becoming one...
<br>
<br>
mustardseed, sure you can refer others others to that post of mine re: how chanelling works if you like.  glad to be of assisstance. [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
"god": i will say this now: if you were GOD, in any of his aspects you would not access this reality in the way you do.  i am not saying that you wouldn't be chanelled by someone, sure that has happened before and ain't that big deal from some of the possible perspectives here.  i am saying that
<i>
 you would not access this reality (this physical dimension) in the way that you do
</i>
.  and mustardseed, if you yourself are interested you might want to ask "god" how he does access this reality...
<br>
<br>
back to you "god", i will also say that you do not understand the nature of love enough, nor have you sufficiently embodied it, to be GOD, in any of his aspects.
<br>
<br>
so, "god" with those two hints, the truth of which you can see, do you want to come clean yet?  or you want to push me on this one?  after all,i have, so far, tried to be gentle and to give you every oppurtunity to "make good" as it were...

If you will bear with me Oz. I just can't help thinking you are really funny. You and rhinegirl both talk as if you have actual power, and give the impression that there will be repercussions if I or "God" do not submit to you, you talk in terms of "sofar I have been gentle" , are you hinting at this as a threat? You talk of "giving us a chance to come clean"..........actually you sound as if you believe you are god yourself? Do you.? Then in the same sentance almost you both speak of "not bowing down to any God" as "seeing the light"[

I am sorry. Mustardseed did not say that he wished for a God that would be a father figure, and with a sense of humor, etc. But he said something about God manifesting Himself to him that way, and that he was comfortable with that personification, that "personnality".
<br>
<br>
I find that what is being channeled is of great value so far.
<br>
<br>
Ps : I just realized that Ozy is the same guy in the other section who makes astrology predictions, and believes (I assume) that there will be a civil war in the USA in 2005, in accordance with what the guy with the traveling machine said, before being « back to the future ». Ozy... Ozy...

Dear Chill
<br>
Nice to hear you talking to God. You are on to something my friend. I would like to help you a bit so here are a few pointers from "God" that might be a help. I asked for something for you.
<br>
<br>
<span id="hl" style="background-color: yellow">
 Channeling God
</span>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 God can you help Chill she wants to talk to you and hear from you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Be glad to......Hi Chill now listen closely. The first point is the most important one. If you want to find My will and truly be led by me, it is important that you have no will of your own. Now before you go.....Hmmmm [
 <img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
 ] let me explain.
 <br>
 <br>
 The key to getting help from me, guidance, joy or whatever needed is to acknowledge that you need My help. This very point is at the base of all other principles of the Christ way. It is like ....lets say you are lost in a forest but have a GPS unit in your bag. If you keep going around saying , I am not lost, I can figure this out, I will try for just another hour, etc etc you will get nowhere. Not until you admit to yourself that you are lost and not able to find the way, do you reach into your pocket and switch the GPS unit on.
 <br>
 <br>
 This First principle is what draws My spirit. You know it is said nature abhors a vaccum. It is the same in the spirit. Now I am not saying that you should be a mindless robot at all but if you are interested in having Me speak to you, you need to have this vaccum, in order to reach out. I will feed the hungry but send the full on their way. The more you do this you will align your will with mine till they become one and you are truly walking with Me.
 <br>
 <br>
 It is equally important that you admit to your self that the way you have previously seen things, reasoned and behaved is indeed not nessesarily the best way, not MY way. When you admit this as a possibility you open your Spirit. It is like pouring water on dry clay, making it more mallable and able to be formed. [
 <img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
 ].
 <br>
 <br>
 I do speak to you, as well as to everybody else, but my voice is often drowned out by all the other voices, the crowd, the popular thing, the in thing and the easy way, and when it is, I will sometimes stop speaking or whisper so silently you do not hear it ....until you get quiet. It takes effort to be quiet, but what do you hear in the silence.....eccoes that will change the world....even your world ....whispers of a bright future....with no pain and sadness....joy and laughter ever after. The outlook may not always be easy but the uplook is always great, the future is as bright as my promises. You are dear to me and I love you, as much as I would love you if you were the only one on the planet.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 thanks....I hope she does not feel it is too personal but I am glad that you have the guts to speak to her like that she is very dear to me as well. Please take care of her problems whatever they are ok?

  and give the impression that there will be repercussions if I or "God" do not submit to you, you talk in terms of "sofar I have been gentle" , are you hinting at this as a threat? You talk of "giving us a chance to come clean"
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
yes, if you wish to perceive it as that, it is a threat, but to "god" not to you mustardseed.  although i'd say that viewing it more as an ultimatum would be more accurate.  for "god" is not GOD, but some other entity playing a slightly more involved game than is initially apparent.  and i'm just saying: "look other entity, you're alright and not deeply negative and opposed to humanity like the zettas and the reptilians were.  but you are manipulating events and you're not being completely honest as to your nature and your agenda.  so look: i'll give you the chance to come clean yourself (as i believe you deserve that for you have communicated some very profound truths to some of humanity afetr all, even if few picked up on them).  but is you won't, i'll spill the beans myself."  which is fair enough i think.

  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>

<br>
<br>
indeed.  one should not worship god as external to you for he is not,  he is, first and foremost, internal to you.  and you are he.
<br>
how can you bow down to who and what you already are?  and if you seek to do so, you will never realise the full enormity of who and what you are.  and if you seek for god outside yourself, and further seek to give your power and your freedom to some outside "god" then you are far further from god than you think.  and nor will you ever find god whilst thus you seek.  whether the external "god" you worship is an entity up on the astral, money or lifestyle here on the physical or whatever.
<br>
<br>
worship not false idols mustardseed.  whatever they claim to be.
<br>
<br>
all the best,

  Obeying the laws with the aim of breaking them (redefining them). Ok. Why break them ? Why should you redefine them ? You wish to be freed from them, is what I understand... ? Correct ? You want to go by your own redefined rules. But how will you achieve this ?

yep, you've understood me pretty much exctly on that one.  as to why i seek to redefine them, i've already covered that (rather long) answer on my thread The Supreme Arrogance and Egocentricity of Sach Kand located here:

as to how i shall do so, well, 2013 plays a crucial role...

  Nice concept. But can you come back to Earth ? What do you want to achieve EXACTLY ? The tao is a revolution against God, you say, God being light, and darkness being Anti-God. And you wish to reunite God with its contrary.. but what are you REALLY talking about ?
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
well, to start with, god, in his highest aspect (the source) is both light *and* dark, both yin *and* yang.  that's the big, big misunderstanding of the xtian and associated religions: they would that god was a reflection of their own beliefs and values and so set him as such, whereas in fact he is what he is.
<br>
<br>
re: the union of light and dark, these had to be seperated the first time the creation was projected in order for the source to have a reference frame against which *to* project the creation.  it's rather like the idea in relativity theory where, for something to move, it has to move *relative to* something.  and as at that time and level there was nothing besides the source it had to divide within itself to project outside of itself.  then said projection could be accomplished by means of what part of its being moving relative to another part of its being.
<br>
<br>
yet this seperation of its own essential nature was painful for the source, and hence for the whole creation, and had some very undesirable consequences within this below-void part of the creation where we're all at.  most notable amongst which is the cyclical nature of existence where bad follows good follows bad etc.
<br>
<br>
so i suppose what i'm really talking about when i talk of reuniting light and dark is the union of the opposing principles of creation so that each contains the other.  and thus, each person and each entity will be able to choose which principle he wished to express in any particular moment for they'll both be active inside him at any particular moment.
<br>
<br>
and, in case you're wondering, the reason that this can be done now is that, come 2013, the creation will be reabsorbed into the source and reprojected from there.  yet this time, it can be reprojected from there with reference to the matrices of creation which were used the first time round.  and so it can be reprojected with light and darj remaining united this time.
<br>
<br>
anyway, for some more details on this large and involved subject, check out the index that i've got listed as my homepage...

  This reality. What reality. THis one. Ok, define : this physical dimension. How come God would not be able to acess this physical dimension *that way*. You say that it's possible to channel his words, but not that way. What do you mean ?
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
the physical reality.  mustardseed's god does not access the physical reality as the lord of the astral plane does.  also, mustardseed's god is an astral entity.

all the best,

<section>
Context : this afternoon I projected into the RTZ. This quickly either turned into a lucid dream or an astral projection. I met many people, looking very human, and in very human settings, whom I could interact with. One woman that seemed like a clerk in a library gave me some information. There was a lot of noise but there were a name I wrote down while I was there, the name of a disease. She wanted me to know something she considers important .  The library, she said, was not the Akashic record, and I don't know if she knew what that was. Anyway, she told me that I do not have CFS (chronique fatigue syndrome), but another disease, known to men. I wrote the name down while over there to remember it better but can't remember it now... 2 words. 2nd word = nucléaire. What the hell is that. She gave me the name of an hospital which does research on this, it has an english name, but I can't remember the name.
<br>
<br>
I asked her to put me in contact on the phone with someone and she refused. I insisted and some other clerk pretended to call this man - x. They said that x was 'unavailable' .
<br>
<br>
Also I tried to contact God while in the RTZ - and boom! back in my body. Obviously. I later projected again, this time to this library, etc.
<br>
<br>
QUESTIONS :
<br>
<br>
1. What the hell is wrong with me physically ? Is this a depression ?
<br>
2. Is this caused by something that goes on on Astral Pulse ? I am fine when I am not here for a while. Don't want to be paranoid...
<br>
3. Is it possible to meet nice people while APing. People I meet are always cold-hearted or petty or ugly inside-out. They are a reflection of me ? I am most probably just dreaming. Still, what does that say about me &amp; my life ?
<br>
4. I miss x. Will I talk to him again soon ?
<br>
<br>
God, I guess that you will not give me specifics, or any information about the future, you just don't do fortune telling. I respect that.
<br>
<br>
Also it would be tricky for Mustardseed to 'diagnose' anything in this thread, from an ethical point of view. And people would get mad, if this channeling were to get too personal, I guess. All this considered, is there something you can tell me that can be of guidance here, God ? Concerning : tiredness, bad dreams, missing someone whom I have tried to contact in my dreams and (perhapse if I have them) astral projections. Pathetic yes, I know.
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mustardseed.

 So.....I am ready
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 for what?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 channeling ofcourse
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes that seems obvious....but what is the question
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 you don't know?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yea.....just kiddin, you thought you had me there didn't you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well ....I was a bit.....lets just go to it, how about sex and pornography
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 pretty heavy stuf isn't it?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yes but somehow I feel there is a difference. I know that sex must be from you, but pornography seems to be different
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it is different......it is my beauty given to man and his "improvement" on it. I made sex....obviously, but you were not satisfied with sex as it was, in other words you could not get enough
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 can you explain that better
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I made it good .....but you changed it, the term overkill komes to mind[
 <img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
 ]. There is nothing wrong with sex, no sin not bad at all but a gift to be enjoyed but if it is not used but abused by man it turns bad. Like everything else. Moderation is the key, everything should be done in moderation, even moderation! Ha. That is the nature of darkness, to make people so hooked on good that it turns into something bad. The enemy creates nothing, he can only take what is allready created and pervert it. He will try to take the credit for things ..like sex and make people feel condemned for enjoying it thinking they surely must be one of his crowd but they are not. This principle governs so many things. I create sex he turns it into perversions, I create plants to heal and help, he turns it into drugs, I create wine, he goes further and turns it into whiskey and rum, by the way do you realise that strong alcohol is a vehicle for negs?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 no I did not, can you explain more about that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 whiskey Rum Gin all of those can harbour a special breed of elementals as you call them, it is not in the alcohol itself but in the combination, drugs as well
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 really.....
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 they are a special breed ...... the arch demons Pan and Bacchus control them, they have been breed with a specific purpose, to seduce and pervert, this is making you uncomfortable isn't it
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yes it is......
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 why don't you take some time and think about these things....I have more to say on this subject....and you need to hear it but you shoul take some time alone first......trust me
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok I will I need to stop now I will talk to you later
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Ok .....dont worry, I am with you always....even there

You're ignorant in regards to mythology aren't you? Well of course you are! You've called Pan and Bacchus demons. They are not demons. Pan is a Satyr. Bacchus is and agricultural deity who has some similarities with the greek god Dionysus.

Hi all
<br>
The next channeling will be about the difference between male and female. Please feel free to require subjects yourself.
<br>
<br>
I realise there is a lot of negative comments on the thread, but have decided , from being counselled by a good friend [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
], to just keep going. The negative comments are appreciated and I read them, but I have to stay true to what I believe and will not engage in a negativly empowered exchange of ideas and words.
<br>
<br>
This is not to say that I do not regards critisism, I do, but I have decided not to answer "a fool according to his/her folly" , some of you might know what this means, some will not. In other words I will attempt to take a stand for positivness, faith, belief, possibilities and choose to continue to believe God loves us all,...... YOU,.....ME..... everybody..... and that he is trying his best to help us all, even though we seem pretty determined to try our best to selfdestruct.

 maybe Mustardseed.....but the TRUTH is not always comfortable sometimes it is hard to take and requires an effort on your part. An effort in believing as well as learning to live with the realities of life. Not just the things that feel right. Life is not a buffet. You are here to learn to take the good with the bad and learn from the hard things in life, as well as enjoy the good, and how you take those hard sayings and tough things is what makes you what you should be.

If you channel the consciousness of the universe what do you think would happen? all focus(human, Zeta, ect since we are a part of this universe) would be placed onto you and...
<br>
<br>
There is no doubt in my mind a channeling is going on though.
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed, on a personal note can you even fathom this being? If so that should answer the question of is this god or not. Channeling is tricky business and things HAVE to go wrong in it. It's like the oiji board. just as tricky and just as dangerous. Please do be carefull [xx(]

<section>
Spectral Dragon, Great hearing that you know hes channeling, but know this when I say MustardSeed knows well about precautions on channeling, and knows how to Test the Spirits.
<br>
<br>
I have some questions for God that have came to me recently:
<br>
<br>
1) Do you like Bubble Gum? if Yes, Why? [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]
<br>
<br>
2) Is reasonable thinking to say the strange connection with this
<br>
'so-called' planet Nibiriu(SP?) orbiting pass our earth around 2012, The Mayan Calendar's ending at/or around 2012, AND the stuff thats said in the bible with Jesus Coming back around 2012(from what many christians say), not to mention the coming events that are to come like earthquakes and such thaT STRANGELY could STRONGLY happen with a GIANT planet mass coming closer to our Planet, Earthquakes, new volcanoes coming out of sleep, poles consistently moveing 2.65 inches every year for who knows how long.
<br>
<br>
3) This is far fetched and I Hope you put some thought into it before you answer, lol hah but you already know haa, MS put thought into wut he says thenlol BUT.  This other crazy, kinda scarey thing thats suppose to happen is the 'Transformation' or wutever where out consciousness is shifted to the 4D.  I did some research and this quite possibly COULD happen because of the planet mass effecting Earths magnetic field, which effects US as well.  With that in mind is it also Reasonable thinking that is what Jesus is talking about when he says when he comes back, theres going to be great change, and he'll take us to his spiritual heavens or whatever.  Now with the believers/non believers.  The people unable to accept this consciousness shift will not make it(christians say you must follow christ when he comes)
<br>
I apologize for the nonsense talking! for real but
<br>
<b>
 <i>
  IS THIS WHATS going to happen?
 </i>
</b>
<br>
do you understand? Humans were made to evolve, Jesus talks about change, and man back then explained things as best they could in thoughs days to get there words out.  Today is the same but with better understanding maybe? Is this makes sense correct?
<br>
<br>
You may answer this or not but it was on my mind and I spent time trying to explain it and It STILL didnt come out right

 I didn't do anything , it was Shaman that started the thread

 I know that
</font>
<br>

 so why do you blame me
</font>
<br>

 becourse you are at fault
</font>

 but they were saying stuf ......
</font>

 how old are you Mustardseed
</font>
<br>

 49.....you know that!!
</font>
<br>

 why is it that as soon as you feel your integrety challenged you have to latch out at people ........ you act like you are 14
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ..........I dont know
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 well I will tell you.......Only by pride comes contention, and love prayer and humility solve all problems. True love.....My LOVE will cover a multitude of wrongdoings. Mans righteousness is not love, it is judgement, it is punishing the guilty, it is a sword, and it cuts to divide, ......but it does not heal. Whats the big deal with you being so slick with your words and so sarcastic. Everybody can cut and slice and put people in their place, with smart comments ......but does that heal or help anyone. An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind. My power is not in the smart comments ,the mind and the pride and selfrighteousness.....my power is in submission, in not answering evil for evil, not in being revengeful, no Mustardseed,.....  it is when you are spoken evil of and put down, and you still smile and do not get bitter, when you are hurting and say: dont blame him, it was my fault, I should have known better. When you take the lower seat, and prefer in ALL things your breatheren your neighbours and others, and when in all things you put yourself last, being a servant of all a healer an uplifter and an encouragement. In thin lies my power.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well.........ok, I will think about that......but what if people are really being rude or bad or lying or whatever
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>

Dear Shaman and Akensai

I am sorry if I was being sarcastic. It is a weakness I have . I have nothing against any of you, actually I dont hardly know you. It is my prayer that we can just get along, and I am OK with you both not believing I am Channeling God. Life is too short to be arguing.........My apologies to you both.

You seem to think I 'm against your channeling, but I'm not. I have my doubts and sometimes I try to give some logical criticism, but you don't seem to respond well to it or perhaps it was because my earlier commends being unpleasant(?), I don't remember them anymore, and my opinion is liable to change quick.

I have a question, that is, if you are still taking questions.  I've read only the first quarter of this thread, so please let me know if this has been asked/answered before.
<br>
<br>
First I'd like to say THANK YOU God for what you have given us, our lives, our feelings, our mind, body and soul, it is just fascinating everyday.  And thank you for the future that awaits!
<br>
<br>
I am wondering, how can children (like me) approach their parents and try to get the parents to see what they are doing wrong over and over, or how they are contradicting themselves, without them thinking something is wrong with me for bringing up such a topic, when in reality the topic is brought up all because of them in the first place.  You know what I mean?  You can point things out to them repeatedly because it's a pattern of actions that seem they need imrpovement on, or at least to not contradict themselves since they often give strong advice that doesn't follow their actions here and there.  And they will deny it, get really mad at you, ignore you, cry, think something is wrong with you, and so on..  Well, you get the picture.
<br>
<br>
So my question is, how do you successfully approach topics to your parents so that they understand I am bringing it up really to help themselves and let them see how some of their actions are viewed externally, without having them deny it and/or dismiss me as inherently wrong since i'm simply the (lower) child?
<br>
<br>
Hope that makes sense and it's not too peculiar of a question.. but then again, you are God, so i guess it can't really be that peculiar, hehe.  Well, time to go back to studying.  Oh yes, I also thank you for the reinforcement you will and have always given me to pass my upcoming test this week.  [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

Mustardseed, I have a few questions for god if you'd be willing to answer them...
<br>
<br>
1. What are your views on vampires? I mean real vampires, such as Sanguarian and Psi Vampires?
<br>
<br>
2. Are you against humans using "drugs"? i'm talking about natural ones, like marijuana and salvia divinorum.  If so, why have them on the Earth? To test us?
<br>
<br>
3. Will humans be in imminent physical danger in the next few years, 2011, 2012, whichever year it is (everybody seems to think it's a different year around then).  If so, how will those who do not fear be able to live?
<br>
<br>
....rrr, i had more but i lost them....
<br>
thanks,
<br>

 Antranik had a question about his parents
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 very good question. You can tell a lot about a person by the questions they ask
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 how so....?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 the questions people ask are what their heart is full of. Some want to know how to help and lift up, others ......well you get the picture
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 never thought about it like that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 First of all, Antranik your motive must be right. Merely being right is not good enough in itself. If you want to BE RIGHT about issues that really does not matter in the big picture, you are just being argumental, however if you really desire to help someone with a problem, humility is the answer and the key that unlocks many hearts. Noone likes to be proven wrong so instead, learn the art of sowing the seed. Make observations, approve in word and deed of positive actions and ignore the bad. Be sweet and always willing to admit it when you yourself are wrong and love your parents by respecting them for all the good they do. Even a broken watch is right 2 times a day so not everything they say is wrong. Focus on the good admire their good points and in time they will start to accept you more and more as an equal and one day...... they will see you as their guide their helper and heir and a strong staff to lean on. Let patience posess your soul. Be not weary in well doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not

<section>
Well thanks a lot for the answers, I really appreciate it along with others.  This was a long computer session I had as I finished reading the entire 26 pages of this thread and I am just shocked at how much more bickering there was than asking questions and all that.  I won't go into any of that, but I believe Mustardseed isn't tricking us, so I will take advantage of this special opportunity.
<br>
<br>
Me and my friend were having a discussion and many good points came up and I want to see your input, as it's so naturally valuable.  I have said many, many times that money is the root of all evil since I have seen it so much negativity come out from it.  The main thing it concerns me is how it has the ability to destroy relationships, make people corrupt, very greedy, angry and other sorts of things.
<br>
<br>
Now I am broke and thoughts came in my head that last week for at least a few days along the lines of...  hey, you're broke, you need some money, but i'm totally contradicting what i always said because I dont want evil!  But i need money, at least a little bit, so does that mean we need a little evil? hah I would think not, so there must be something wrong in this belief.   There's also the saying that desire is the root of all evil, and that seems a little more sensible as desires (for money) can coincide with NEEDS (I need money to pay the rent).  So what is it, and is the statement X is the root of all evil inherently problematic as the definition of evil in our heads, or moreso, the degree to which something is evil, is different for everyone?
<br>
<br>
See the dilemma?  I, along with many others, need to know what "doctrine" to follow to not contradict myself with this issue of money and materialism and all that attached to it.
<br>
<br>
Is it wrong in the first place to WANT?  Since eventually, no matter what we do, we are going to buy something that we simply want when we get the money for it, such as wanting a great home for your family.  So what's the point of restricting ourselves, you know what I mean?
<br>
<br>
Well, thanks in advance. [

Mustardseed, this thread has gone far longer than I thought it would. That is not proof you are talking to "god", but I think you are talking to somebody out there. If not, you would have ended this long ago.
<br>
<br>
I re-ask my question in the second post in this thread (first page). Any "god" could answer it if its possible. I ask not for myself, but for the state of technical progress of this planet. Dont give me bulls**t like we should do it ourselves. If you are god and you want to help, you will. It is illogical to hide useful information.
<br>
<br>
If it is answered, anybody who sees the answer please send me a private message, because I probably wont see it in the many pages of this thread.

Ok, Hi Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
The archangel has not yet answered my questions, so maybe you will. Althgough the coolest would be if you both answered them. OK, here goes:
<br>
<br>
I'm working on a novel. It's quite a long one. By writing it, I am putting quite much of myself into this work. I don't have a writer's talent, but I'm trying and the idea itself is very good(not only my opinion).
<br>
<br>
I'd like to know,
<br>
1. is there any point of continuing writing my book
<br>
and
<br>
2. if he sees future, then what could he say about mine?
<br>
<br>
I am certain that God won't give the answers "yes"/"no", but if you could ask these, I'd still be very grateful.
<br>
<br>
May shadows reach the light,
<br>
Gwathren

Mustardseed,
<br>
<br>
While I don't agree with some of the comments that God makes during your channelling session(when God supposedly calls Robert Bruce a 'kid' in one of the past posts,for example), I believe the rest of the information passed along is sincere and accurate. I get so inspired reading your posts, Mustardseed, that I find myself coming back to the computer more often than I feel I should.
<br>
<br>
After having read some of the past comments, I hope to see you back soon.

Good stuff Mustardseed, building your boat engine I mean.
<br>
<br>
I've missed you, and I will private message you about something.
<br>
<br>
By the way (and I will edit this out later on) I have included you in a movie script of mine, a script for a short film that might made in the fall, if it's meant to be.
<br>
<br>
In the scene a woman speaks to a man in a restaurant by a highway and she says :
<br>
<br>
- I might have met someone who speaks directly to God. His name is David Mustardseed. You should write this down.
<br>
<br>
- Sounds familiar.
<br>
<br>
- No, not David Copperfield the magician : David Mustardseed, the God channeler.
<br>
<br>
Something like that. Actually only bits of the script have been written so far, but many, many notes have been jotted down.
<br>
<br>
How's life treating you ?
<br>
<br>
By the way, you are just a clin d'oeil in the movie. I haven't dare to steal anything from your life or your inspired words, just decided to mention you along the way. People in the audience (hypothetical audience) might think that you are a purely fictional character, or they might check you out.
<br>
<br>
Check your pm.

</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Money money money not so funny, it's the rich mans curse
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 that was a old song but you changed the words
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes becourse they were not the truth. Its not always sunny in a rich mans world on the contrary. The rich heap on themselves many problems worry and rarely have a fulfilled life. The love of money is the root to all evil, becourse the love of money is really pride lust, and all sorts of destructive emotions and temptations come with those things. Money in itself is not evil at all. It is really a matter of learning in all things to be content, whether abounding or abased.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so its not the money themselves but what money can buy
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes.....but we are not talking about a dozen of eggs or a t shirt here. We are talking about people who buy stuf they do not need, people for whom money represents power and who use money and its power to currupt and harm and hinder. It is all in the motive.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so how does one make sure ones motive is right
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 you must test your motive like you test a spirit
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok .....can you be a bit more specific?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 first of all pray and talk to me about the things you want. If your way please me if you lives in love and gives freely of what you have, the true riches of love joy compassion, your time and energy, to those in need that you meets on your way, I will more than abundantly give you the riches of earth. Not always when and how you wants it, but I will never leave you without comfort.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but many people who believe in you are poor is that a test then?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 ha the true test is riches not poverty, but yes some are poor and believe in me, but my way is not your way and my righteousness is not yours, as the heavenly dimension is far deeper that the physical so my way is far deeper than your way. Trust me, I know what I am doing, and I have a purpose in everything. As a diamond shines and sparkels no matter which way you turn it so is my creation sparkeling, learning and growing every day
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok thanks

 Chill had a few questions.......she didn't give specifics, but I thought I would give it a shot anyway. She seems so sincere, is there anything that you would like to say?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes actually there is
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 wow this is going to be excieting
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 maybe for some. Ok lets get to it. First I want to explain to you that this kind of channeling, we could call it faith channeling, becourse you have to have more faith in what you recieve, is not as easy to do as other kinds.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what is the difference
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it is kind of like a mirror, the more she shows of herrself, the easier it is to make out the image in the mirror, but the less she shows the more she has to use her own faculties once the message is given
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 that sounds .....complicated
</font>

 thats just becourse you are nervous...try to relax and let me speak to Nay

 ok I will try

 Hi there!!!well it seems you are pulling through. I thought I would talk to you a bit and explain so MS wont get in the way. I want to make sure that you understand that this is between you and me. I see you Nay.....I see you. I understand and I am with you in the good and bad for better or worse, You have to judge everything by its fruit. Is it the right desision? That depends on the long term fruit that will come from it, the short term is seldom a good guide. If your heart is vigilant and if you from your soul desire the change and the newness I am with you even there. Life's battles are inevitable my dear, on the ocean of this life, storms come and go and there is nothing you can or should do about that, but much can be done in the tending of the helm and the manning of the boat. You decide if a storm will make you sink or swin, by your vigilence. In every calamity there is an opportunity, and later that will become very evident, however how you do things is very important, kindness curtesy love and respect are not only to be shown to the deserving, but to everyone. Have faith examine your heart and trust in me, I will never leave you or forsake you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 wow
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 you are still worried arn't you
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yes I worry that this is totally off and that I am ......well you know
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 trust me
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I will do my best....what about the angel?
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 at every crossroad, my messengers hold watch, at every border and at every change they are there to do my bidding, to warn to guide to watch and wait for my command. She is dipping her cup in change and even there my Spirit through my forces hold watch.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I have no idea what that means
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 I know...thats ok
</font>
<br>

What do you mean god? There is many more than just one GOD! The greeks egyptian and other cultures didn't worship false gods. The gods they worshipped had been hand selected by the founders of their race from the Atral Realm. Many more entities lie in the astral realm that have never been chosen to be a god. Have you ever heard of a Speaker For the Gods? This was a person whose job was to visit the selected gods for the culture to question them, report to them, and so on.

It's not that God is an individual just like us, but rather it is all of us as individuals that make him up.  God experiences everything through us.  We experience emotions, God knows what emotion feels like because we can feel it, and besides, he probably created it!  It's like when it comes to humor, people think God is supposed to be all strict and serious and we can't have a God that might be.. well.. funny. :gasp:  But he created the humor!

<br>
<br>
Well I think that's how it is, but I'm sure MS and God can let us know how on track we are.
<br>
<br>
This emotion-thing actually just rung a bell in my head.. So I have a question as well now.
<br>
<br>
Is it true that there is a Mother Azna, the emotional dimension of the Godhead, and the Father God, the intellectual dimension of the Godhead?  I have heard that, while you can't see electricity, you can see it when it arcs for a brief moment and in the astral plane, just like electricity, Azna can reveal itself for a few minutes while the Father God can maintain some form so highly charged we can't even make it out for a few heartbeats.  How accurate is that?  So if Mustardseed is channeling God as we call it, is it God as in.. the combination of the Father/Mother together all the time, or is there an actual split in the actual entity.  I know the physical plane is very much different (or simpler) than the other higher planes, so there is probably some error in my reasoning when it comes to talking about an entity being split or revealing itself or whatnot, but you know.. i'm just trying to take a stab at it, get my thoughts out.  All right, time for the usual cereal and milk.  [

 can we talk about the emotion thing, how you can be God and still relate as a man. I think it is a valid question?

 ok lets.

 I have been a man, I know what it is like to walk on earth, to hunger be tired worn out have to attend to the body and its needs.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 oh .....I get it, so how about negative emotions, have you ever been there
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 well it is a tricky question to answer. I have been approched by some that have tried to tempt me, I have never been tempted though
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 can you explain
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 a man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust for things he should not have , lust in matters pertaining to the soul as well as the physical, pride etc when the temptation has conquered he is decieved into believing that the desire of his heart is a good thing and I often through free will let him have the desire of his heart but I will send leanness to his soul. When I was tempted this was never a real option. I cannot be tempted in the same way you can, nor do I tempt any man
</font>
<br>

 do you have feelings and emotions like us
</font>

</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 do you experience our emotions as well
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes I do but again, in a different way. As I told you before as the heaven is higher than the earth, the spiritual higher than the physical so my way are higher than yours, but he was right in the main point, I have made you becourse of love and delight in you and seeing you learn, I feel with you. Thats one reason I am here

 here in this room?
</font>
<br>

 no here in this thread, I am as real to everyone who reads this with faith, as I am to you. I love you.....yes you who is reading this , I love you as if you were the only person on earth, and I am right there with you in everything you do. I know how hard it is at times, I had to make it hard, but dont worry one day you will understand. When the time comes at the time of your passing, for though you think and act as if you will live forever your days are numbered as are the days of all, so see to it that you use your days well.

You know, 20 years ago there were problems in pc communication. People had bss-os, that was something like todays Internet news groups. People could chat about everything that they liked (drinks, cars, politics,...). But there wasn't way to show your fillings, like if you are kidding, or being sarcastic, so not all people understood what you are saying. That's how so called "flame war" came up.
<br>
One nice sunny day, in year 1982. scientist Scot Falman from American university Carnegie Mellon in Pitsburg got realy pis*ed off. That day he went to BBS and started writing to his colleagues and tried to invent marks that would precisely show nature of message. It came up with lots of marks like \_/ for smile or (#) for joke, but it didn't work out. That's when Felman got the idea for smileys like
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
and
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
. People loved it. It spreaded very fast and became daily way of communication. So, Felman could just stand and watch different variations of his smileys apear.
<br>

LOL That is hilarious.  I can't believe you wrote that story to refute the idea that God invented smileys.  Hahahahaah... smilies weren't going to happen out of hte blue.  They weren't going to magically be put on every web page out there, someone actually had to start use it obviously.  He also says he invented hte telephone for example.  Why don't you go find the history of hte telephone and list it here.  The point of Him saying that is, you wouldn't have a telephone or a smilie if God hadn't created the mind that he did for everyone.

 Akensai is asking if violence has anything to do with his spirituality
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 as I told you you can tell a lot about a person by the questions they ask
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I remember that....but how does that relate to him
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 He is somewhat concerned about this possibility but also somewhat rebellious to the very idea and so he is ready to justify himself. The fact remains that since he is asking he is showing everybody that he is in doubt, and what so ever he does, thinking that it might be wrong , to him is wrong. He might try to justify himself but when he does the words of his own mouth will condem him.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 but sometimes I like action movies as well ....lots of folks do
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 .....and
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 well seems a lot of folks like it does that not matter
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 if the whole world does a wrong thing ...its still a wrong thing
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 yes but is it really that bad
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 it depends on the moderation and the situation. If the violence is part of the story it is somewhat justifiable, the problem is that violence is addictive. Just like drugs and all sorts of other things. Violence in itself is not the problem, but if not in the right place for the right reason it is. Akensai as well as a lot of you have developed a perverted taste for violence. I am not a pacifist ok, I am agressive against evil and I justify violence under certain circumstances
</font>
<br>

 really tell me which

Hi Cube
<br>
I don't have a preset idea at all. One kind of question however I find quite annoying is the ones that indicate disbelief on the part of the person asking. Not that doubt is a problem but it seem to often lead to a string of posts with very little debth and it quickly becomes time consuming to answer.
<br>
<br>
Some questions I am quite drawn to and others God seem to be drawn to, it seems the clearer the question the easier it is for me to formulate and the easier it is to get something. I don't know why that is so.

Hey guys, some texts say that the point of life is to learn, learn and learn more.  Is this really the point of life? If reincarnation is true, which it seems like it since life is eternal, then suppose this my 400th lifetime, I think i've learned aplenty during that time and the wisdom in my "self" can come out through me somehow.  So what is the point or goal of our life?

Hi Mustardseed, I will make a point to make my questions as clear as I can make them.

1.) I'm reading the book "Love Without End, Jesus Speaks". Is this book accurate in that the path it would lead a person down is correct?
<br>
<br>
2.) Is it really Jesus who is in the book?

3.) What is meant by the phrase 'Suns of God'?

I have some questions for "god."
<br>
<br>
1)The dragons have been around for a long time, and I was wondering why the need for being discreet among them. (Reffering to "heavenly" dragons, don't worry mustardseed god should know what this refference is.) This has been bothering me for a while.
<br>
<br>
2)How many lifetimes have you, the very universe, been around in your current form as the universe?
<br>
<br>
3)Will metaphysical, mythical, and scientifical studies ever be merged?
<br>
<br>
4)I feel that It is my duty to show some people things about mysticism, an example would be the fictional worlds thread. The micheal thread as well is an example. Is this feeling wrong?
<br>
<br>
5)In the micheal thread there is much doubt about the entity that is being mediated. While I have little doubt the entity is what it claims, I was wondering the specifics about the entity. Is this the part of micheal that is present in my higher self? Or is the entity something else? Is there a name for this specific aspect of Michael?

What language is that?  From what i've been reading about this channeling business, if Mustardseed doesn't know that language, God (or anything else being channeled) can't speak to MS with that language.  He is limited to his own mind, something like that.  It's interesting stuff.
<br>
<br>
Is it wrong that I just killed this mosquito.. I'm guessing like that last answer, it is because I am wondering if it is.. grr.. but.. they'll bite me at night! [:I] [

Dear SD
<br>
If you will have me excused, I was quite unaware that you were the one to decide when anything is done or not done. Not to mention that I find it ludicrus [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
] for you to even insinuate that you are somehow qualified to "test" me or anyone else. You obviously think quite highly of yourself. All that aside please I beg you do not call me Dude. I cant handle that. Anywhere 10ft around me is  officially a "dudefree zone". Maybe it did not "fit" the way you expected it to fit, but maybe it did fit somebody.
<br>
<br>
I promise that if I ask you your opinion of my Channeling, if I seek validation from you, feel free to Dude me then, and I will take you serious. As it stands my scaly friend, you asked me, and I channeled an answer. Did you ask me becourse you wanted to know the opinion of "God" or did you allready have the answer made up in your own mind.
<br>
<br>
He said to them , be careful you do not become the blind leaders of the blind. They asked him are we blind, and he said, If you were blind you would not be blamed but becourse you say "we see" therefor you take unto yourself all the blame.
<br>

Mustardseed, cool off, you are getting too heated over this. I was simply saying you should consider that this is not what you are thinking it is. whatever you are channeling did not get the question I was asking as concerns dragons. If this was truly god then he would have cuaght the subtle hints I gave.
<br>
<br>
If you have a problem with me testing this entity, you should not be channeling. Period. Channelings are not supposed to be the way to find out life's paths and answers. You have to admit, any of us claiming to talk to these higher entities are making huge claims, and thus must be tested accordingly.
<br>
<br>
As for why anyone is qualified to test, please take a good long thought as to the quotes in my signitures. Sheez we are all living on the same world, and if anyone requires validity they have to find it for themselves, I am sorry if this troubles you. God cannot validate anything for me, he can only give me hints.
<br>
<br>
yes, I was expecting a good answer, I got one, and that was be very carefull. I shal be from now on. The other answer just did not have anything to do with the question asked whatsoever, sorry.
<br>

Everyone was jumping into the bandwagon, I thought I would give this a shot, as two of those questions were troubling me, now I truly know I must find the answer for myself. "God" cannot answer my question. Again, the question he answered was the wrong questions. I would like to ask, when were the dragons I spoke of supposed to be slain? Why should guardians be slain?
<br>
<br>
And what's so wrong with the word "dude?" I don't understand, is this a cultural thing that means something else than what I am used to thinking it as?
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed, instead of taking offense, you should ask yourself, Why am I being tested? I myself have recently had to ask the same question. I would like to hear god's thoughts on why both of us are being tested, BTW.
<br>
<br>
As I said in the archangel thread, channeling a being like that is impossible, our physical bodies can't handle the pressure. Are you channeling, or mediating?

Dear SD
<br>
First let me apologize if my reply was too uptight, that was not the intent. I tried to be funny and make my answer non agressive by putting in things like "scaly friend" "dudefree zone" etc but alas[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
]the jokes and lightheartedness of this scorpio was once again taken as a sting. Dont misunderstand me it was a sting but I had hoped to make it a bit less "stingy". Anyway all that aside, I actually felt that the answer and my burden was for the question in a foreign language, and not for you. That was the post I felt I was answering but since I threw in "Dragons" I guess it came out as if I was answering you as well. My mistake.
<br>
<br>
In any case for the record I DO NOT TAKE MYSELF TOO SERIOUS. I believe that I am channeling God. but I am very ignorant of Channeling as YOU and maybe others know it and do it my way. I do not call it any of the things you call it, I merely called it Channeling to find a point of unity with the AP members.
<br>
<br>
In my vocablery I call it Prophesying.
<br>
<br>
As you may or may not know prophesy is one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, along with healing and many others. There are many gifts that have been "lost" to modern man through unbelief but which were part of the life of early Christianity. I have explained in detail about this "gift" in the thread or in one of my posts and if you are interested in how it works I can see if I can find it.
<br>
<br>
Incidently the Zetas seemed to adopt some of the methods I explained and changed their Channeling here and there as a result. Interesting[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

<br>
<br>
I would like to give it one more shot as I really felt that I was being too unprayerful in the asking of the question. What do you think.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
PS to Nay God told me that He had a "hard" time with your getting on his case. He laughed so long and so hard that he almost forgot to let it rain in Florida......when he finally got to it we had a real down pour.[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

<br>
Funny thing. As I read Mustardseed's previous-to-last reply, I thought to myself : here is the scorpio speaking. I think I learnt about Mustardseed's sign in some thread - « what's your sign ».
<br>
<br>
Not that I put too much weight in astrology but scorpios are often blunt and in their way of expressing themselves they get people hurt and offended, quite often without ANY intent of starting any war/comotion. It will often come as a shock to them, that they got people hurt along the way, with their words. And on the Internet, unfortunately, there are only words.
<br>
<br>
Not that scorpios I have known can't be smooth, and gentle, etc. but often when they are neutral and want to make a point, they will use such language that will vex people. Hurt their ego espescially.
<br>
<br>
I must add that they are sometimes consciously aware of hurting the ego of people they are responding to, they are 'good' at that cause they know ego, they are espescially aware of their own ego, and that's why I like them ;-)I come across as being quite aware of my own ego too, so we get along. You can't fight someone who is aware of ego 'battles', ego-ness very well. The less aware you are of your ego, the bigger it gets, this rule applies most of times.
<br>
<br>
Why am I rambling and making generalizations ? No clue.
<br>
<br>
Because I am a woman and like to categorize people.
<br>
<br>
ABOUT TESTING GOD :
<br>
<br>
Actually it seems to me that God does allow some hard testing to be done, even on a daily basis. He provides many, many things, events, often things come exactly as we wished them to come, often also in a better way that we could imagine, proofs are everywhere, confirmations and also the opposite of confirmations - infirmations ? - of the thoughts that go out to him. We ask, we pray, He/she responds.
<br>
<br>
I am very rarely left in the dark about anything. And I suppose that I am not the only one like that. Speak to God, ask him questions, you'll quickly get some unambiguous answers. I don't know. This happens to me anyway.
<br>
<br>
About testing Mustardseed's God, well, in my opinion nowadays, I think that there is no entity channeled by Mustardseed but that his words come as guided by the holy ghost, and yes I think that one  can receive a God-given gift of 'knowing' certain things about others, clairvoyance, many would name those gifts psychic abilities, this is not just a wise man speaking - to me. It's something a little more complex, but obviously not channeling per say. No 'personnified One God' nor any entity is involved but some form of Godliness would, it seems.
<br>
<br>
I think (but I might be WRONG, what do I know ??) that Mustardseed has come a long way before earning the ability to exercize this gift WELL. Yes, he's a natural but in order for him - in my opinion - to be actually able to exercize this gift WELL, he must be in a certain kind of disposition. And he uses prayor to get into the right disposition. It's not mindset but a heartset. For someone else it might be meditation. Basically it's about connecting with 'Godliness', whaterver you can call this voice. If not in the right disposition Mustardseed will just write down/think UP wise words. Actually the results of what he does might not be entirely (100%) 'guided' but I assume that he knows how to differentiate between intellectually-pleasing words from him Mustardseed versus guided words from a source that doesn't quite get through the usual thinking synapses.
<br>
<br>
Yep, that's prophesizing alright. The jewish &amp; christian definition of it.

Cube asked an interesting question in the other thread, a question about adamantine. He says he's reading a book.... Title is
<br>
"Love without end [trademark symbol here], Jesus speaks"...
<br>
<br>
look at the channeler's site, lots of things to buy :
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.lovewithoutend.com/books/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.lovewithoutend.com/books/index.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
In that book it says that the the world is made out of particules of adamantine and the more loving one becomes the more powerful one gets at transforming those particules. Power of Love Meets Love of Power : very 'attractive' concept.
<br>
<br>
In the encyclopaedia, "adamantine" is an archaic word used either figuratively and/or poetically. Originally it meant : diamant. Often used in fantasy fiction. If you look for the word in google groups, you'll end up with a myriad of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///alt.games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 alt.games
</a>
threads.
<br>
<br>
QUESTION FOR GOD :
<br>
<br>
- any comments on this channeler ? And on our thirst for power ?
<br>
<br>
I had a talk with myself today and I came out admitting that I would love to get some power over other people's destinies - no less. How much more powerful would someone wish to be ?

I am under the impression the stinger of the scorpio is meant for defense, If I have been too offensive I apoligize, but I do hope you take what I said above in mind. We are doing something a little too "out there" not to be looked upon with question.

yes, do please get to the questions I asked, I am interested in the answer, as I do know for one thing that the entity you are mediating is at least related to god or a fragment of god.

I'm going to repost some of my questions because I think they got lost in the fray.
<br>
<br>
1.) "Only one life it will soon be past only what is lived for love will last"
<br>
<br>
Does that mean there's no reincarnation?
<br>
<br>
2.) I'm reading the book "Love Without End, Jesus Speaks". Is this book accurate in that the path it would lead a person down is correct?
<br>
<br>
3.) Is it really Jesus who is in the book?
<br>
<br>
4.) What is meant by the phrase 'Suns of God'?

 yes but not here on earth in this dimension not rebirth. In the spiritual there are many levels dimensions there is order and there is progression. But people colour things, they like to think it is all so simple, follow this instruction book and you are fine , this is also the problem with that girl.

Hello,
<br>
<br>
I wanna say something towards this 'line' of disagreement that is going on here.  Past couple weeks I have been in this same conversation with people and in the end we all came to the conclusion that people have there beliefs, and qiute honestly, you have to admit we
<b>
 all
</b>
wanna be Right.  It is like two groups with 2 beliefs on science, or politics.  But with this topic, noone I BELIEVE knows until you die.  You really do not know until you die.  People will argue and argue and argue to get there point across but I came to a conclusion that you really do not know untill you die.  That is why I will take into consideraTION everything that is said in such a contraversal(SP?) issue.
<br>
<br>
I do know there is  a god, I do believe there was a jesus that was put on this earth for us.  I also believe about the muslim religion, and the buddist(SP?) religion.  Were all connected, the problem now is, people's natural reaction to defend there beliefs.  But the real solution is accept anything.  Love everything and accept what happens when you die.

Dear Nay and everyone
<br>
I hope you are all well and that this day finds you thrilled and inspired and that this little blurb will be helpfull in re-etirating some of the considerations I have had about the Channeling I do. First let me assure you that it is entirely possible that the channeling is "colured" as I call it. It stands to reason that my beliefsystem, which is quite ridgid in some areas, could "do" that.
<br>
<br>
However I would like you to read the message trough again and truly try to consider its finer hints and nuances. It is my understanding that Gods universe, his order, his plan for each one as well as how he does it and why is way beyond us, and we may indeed be unable at this time to understand it or even just a bit of it.
<br>
<br>
It is my belief and it has been confirmed by "God" that reincarnation , as traditionally understood in Hindu and Buddhist teachings, is not the truth unchallenged per se. There are elements in it that has has some truth to it, but it is a very simplified world view and is not "THE TRUTH" in its intirety. Like wise the Christian Fundementalist doctrines (concerning Re-incarnation)contain elements of truth as well, and allthough those elements are part of THE TRUTH, the way they are interpreted and lived (judgementalism would be a good word) they seem to negate the very truth they claim to bring.
<br>
<br>
There seem to be several indications that some aspects of reincarnation might be true. Some people have memories of past lives, kids remember lives in heaven and on and on. Since these things indicate that some have lived in the past or at least have such memories. I think the problem is, that we as the limited humans we are take the closest "model" of belief system and apply it to the things we "figure out", and before we know we become ridgid. Anytime anyone else challenges us we defend this beliefsystem as if it was "our own" without truly examining all the points and theories in it that does not hold water. We seem to thrive in a set belief system like fish in water(that in itself seems very indicative that we could all be wrong about a lot of things). A good explanation and sample of this "problem with being human" is Robert Bruces Catch basket concept as well as his teatrise on Reincarnation.
<br>
<br>
All that said and done, please understand that I am not , nor did I ever claim to be, channeling "The sum of total TRUTH" and as Chill explained above, my relationship with "God" is the result of 30some years of living working for and trying to apply the Bible and Gods love. It seems to me that the more I learn about God the more I realise how little I know, but there are certain Truths that I still believe are very basic and might even be a sort of foundational belief. The first being that it is Gods plan for man thet we should LOVE Him with all of our heart all our soul and all of our mind, the next is almost the same, that we should love our neighbour and everyone we meet in this life as we love ourself.
<br>
<br>
I hope you do not take this as messing with you, as always I enjoy your input and candor, and remain
<br>
<br>
Yours
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
PS This observation by Kazbadan states one such contradiction. Very interesting point

Hi Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
There were 3 very important days for me at school this semester.
<br>
2 projects and 3 days of shooting. The first project was a group effort, I had the last word (I was directing), but due to conflict with another person (the dop), I let the project slide from my hands, the result was so-so, but my own contribution was pretty good, and how I felt was great on those 2 days of shooting, I was very calm and extremely happy. I felt like this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
<br>
<br>
The last project was solo, and the result was wonderful. So good that some people now want me to make it into a bigger project in the fall, involving a group of people, more important resources.
<br>
<br>
God is behind it all : it was because of God that the result was so good you see, things happened, things were said, everything fell into place with great timing, it was a documentary where reality was greater than fiction.
<br>
<br>
People who saw the film were moved.
<br>
<br>
BUT I PRAYED SO MUCH beforehand. I was filming my father meeting his mother for the second time in about 4 years, his mother who suffers from Alzheimer disease. He ends up taking her to his home for an hour, where he lives with 4 cats and a real clutter.
<br>
<br>
Now there is a deadline to turn in projects for the next semester. I want to present a fiction project (which, if chosen, will be filmed in 35 mm and perhapse shown in film festivals around the world...) and a documentary. I can present both.
<br>
<br>
I had an idea for a fiction, but it wasn't good enough. I abandoned this idea. I am open to new ideas now. But I have only 9 days to find one and develop it, write the script, etc. I need a miracle.
<br>
<br>
As far as the documentary, I don't think that I can develop what has already been done with a group of people. It just won't get any better than that. It was fluke - God.
<br>
<br>
I've never had ambitions. I've had pride, but no 'projects', no ambitions.
<br>
<br>
Many people whom I like very much will present their own film ideas, only 3 fictions are chosen out of a potential 30 submissions, same with documentaries.
<br>
<br>
Pray for me.

Mustardseed,
<br>
I asked a few questions a while back that went unanswered.  I understand you're basically being flooded with questions, hehe, but if you find the time I'd appreciate the questions being answered.  Here they are again:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='"limegreen"'>
 1. What are your views on vampires? I mean real vampires, such as Sanguarian and Psi Vampires?
 <br>
 <br>
 2. Are you against humans using "drugs"? i'm talking about natural ones, like marijuana and salvia divinorum. If so, why have them on the Earth? To test us?
 <br>
 <br>
 3. Will humans be in imminent physical danger in the next few years, 2011, 2012, whichever year it is (everybody seems to think it's a different year around then). If so, how will those who do not fear be able to live?
</font>

 There are some questions from Kristina, and Never knows enough
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 lets concentrate on Kristina, never knows enough seems to know how he wants me to answer so we will leave him to answer his own question
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok....so are there Vampires
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes....and .....no. This issue is similar to the one that I have allready answered, about alien reptile races and such. They exist only in the mind and thoughts of people to begin with. But as folks are bombarded with their existance daily in movies books and tv and the internet some get sucked into their world.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so they are not real beings then
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 no not the way you think. They are not a race they are not immortal nor do they benefit from blood but they think they do, and they continue on in their dream world. Most cannot face the real world the defeats and the hardship and opt for the imaginary, where they are mighty creatures. They feel the power of the dark side and most are severely afflicten with neg attachments. Rather that sucking the energy og others they themselves are the prey.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 so no Dracula then
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 no movie screen dracula, no Buffy no Angel none of that
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 what is that Psi and sargantuan or whatever
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 its just names they use to differentiate, but lets leave this subject it is not a subject I would want you to delve into, it is the madness of man
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 ok how about drugs, if you did not want people to use them why did you make them
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 most have dual purposes or other uses but mans imagination .......leave it to you all to find a way to destroy yourself. It is all part of my plan, why did I create evil, why did I create darkness, why did I allow temptation....so you could grow and learn and so you could learn to use your own judgement. That is what makes life what it is, desisions desisions.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 Her last question is about the future, she asks:
</font>
<br>
<br>
Will humans be in imminent physical danger in the next few years, 2011, 2012, whichever year it is?
<br>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 Yes, it's growing darker and many negative entities are released from the pit to decieve and lead astray. Things are changing and the world will change, but ever so slowly, he that has eyes let him see and he that has ear let him hear and he that can let him discern the signs of the times. It is all destined to happen in its appointed time. Yet they that do know me shall be strong and explore, and they shall teach many of MY way.
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 that sounds pretty intense, maybe we can talk about that another time a bit more
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 sure
</font>
<br>
<font color='"red"'>
 I gotta go, I am sooo tired and have a cold
</font>
<br>
<font color='"blue"'>
 yes I know , but you are fighting....thats good, and besides that it will help you to appreciate your good health, you are hardly ever sick...Right?. See you later
</font>
<br>

 yea actually I should be thankful....thanks

Hey God, nice warmer air we are having today.  Music sounds greater than ever lately as well, so I sayy.... thank you for the music! (thinking of abba right now)
<br>
<br>
Listen, you obviously made some outstanding bodies.  Many of us are guilty of feeding it TRASH every day!  And yet hte expected lifetime is between 80-90's.  I'm wondering, how long have you made our bodies be able to live on physically.  I know I believe that we live forever, but our physical bodies aren't so fortunate... or are they?  Is there some guideline as to what foods or drinks we should always avoid or anything like that?  The thought of living 150+ years and being able to walk around and all that nice stuff sounds cool to me for some reason. [:I] Stuff like that...!  Thanks. [

chill,
<br>
I think it's an interesting question: God and love affairs, and especially God and sex.  But what kind of presence or actions are you looking for/hoping for on God's part?  In what ways does God's presence seem lacking?
<br>
<br>
Or do you simply mean that you haven't had much luck there?
<br>
<br>
Maybe there is some deep sense that God keep his heart out of romantic love and sex in some way.
<br>

I'd like to hear more.

<section>
but what if it was.  As above so below.
<br>
<br>
I mean it's such a commonplace that God is perfect and never makes mistakes and it's just our limited view and all that
<br>
<br>
crap.
<br>
<br>
But what if God did make mistakes, is evolving, and the problems around us in part mirror mistakes and confusions God had and is working on.
<br>
<br>
I mean things have been pretty damn messed up for a long time and most religious people just jump past the obvious that there has been a heavenly problem also because the idea of problems throughout is just too damn scary.
<br>
<br>
And before you feel immediately superior to this viewpoint please trust me at least this far...I have deeply done many of the God is perfect belief systems and chosen somethign that feels deeper to me and could make clever chastizing 'deep' comments from that perspective.  If you don't buy that idea (God has messed up in some ways) fine!
<br>
<br>
But If you are getting tired of making excuses for God, excuses God no longer wants made, maybe your actual emotional reaction, that something messed up has been going on, is true and real and not an indication of your own limitness, spiritual backwardness or the newness of your soul.

I think you already know the answer to this.

<br>
<br>
Religion is a good guideline but everyone knows it's not the end all accurate source of spirituality, it's just taken a wide/mass appeal.  And maybe that's where the problem is, when a religion spreads out and becomes accepted b thousands and becomes an "institution," weird rules come out of it all.

I'm only saying what I'm saying because earlier in this thread God mentioned that for most questions, you already KNOW the answer right there, just think about it for a minute..
<br>
<br>
And it's true!!  I *really* need to think about my questions before I post them here because msot things just have an answer ring inside me already and I feel okay I should find a more mysterious question.

Dear Friends
<br>
<br>
I believe this point, posted by Antranik, was in fact the purpose of this thread. It was my intention that YOU realise you yourself can ask God for the answers to your questions in life. In a way it may seem as a contradiction that I "Channel God", and then ask you to talk to Him yourselves, but it was my intention to demonstrate how close I believe He wants to be to us ALL, and to help you understand that you too can have an relationship with Him.
<br>
<br>
I have learned a lot through this thread. Mostly to be loving and kind inspite of hurt feelings, (that is a pretty big and important lesson for a Scorpio) and to not get flustered by peoples lack of faith. I also noticed that many folks that have asked me for answers to their questions about specifics , the "what should I do" type of questions, seem to actually more be looking for a confirmation rather than an answer. I sense that most allready heard from "God" [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
] and know what they should do, but they just have a hard time doing it. [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
] Welcome to the club [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
]
<br>
<br>
This problem is very common for for many of us. Hoping that noone will take offense I will here "take a chance" and quote a part of the New Testament that has always meant a lot to me[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
] . In this passage Paul is faced with the same dilemma. It seems that he does know what he should do but have a hard time actually doing it.
<br>
<br>
Rom 7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rom 7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
<br>
<br>
I realise that many of you do not believe in the concept of the flesh being "bad" so try to "translate" it instead, into you being too lazy, compromising, afraid, timid or whatever it is that is hindering YOU from doing the things you KNOW you should do. This could be quiting bad habits, acting certain agressive or self destructive ways, breaking off from a unfruitful relationship or whatever.
<br>
<br>
When we are faced with these things and desire a change, it is very important that we all sit down and do a little Honest &lt;span id='hl' style='background-color: yellow'&gt;Channeling God&lt;/span id='hl'&gt; ourselves [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]. This has always and continue to be my primary use of Prophecy/channeling, to find His will for
<u>
 MY
</u>
life. As a side benefit we might find a few little snippets and interesting facts emerge for others as well, but a personal "closer walk" with God should in my opinion be the primary goal.
<br>
<br>
So...in the light of this, I would like to say goodbye for now to you all. Due to very pressing duties I will have to spend way less time on the AP. It is my hope that you all are well and safe and that you will find your way through life. My advise to you all is that you live your life in the sunshine, stay positive inspite of adversity, find the good in every suposedly "bad" thing that ever happens to you, flee the baser things of humanity such as abuse vengence hate and lust in all its forms and as the old poem says
<br>
<br>
All through life my friends
<br>
If you will be a happy soul
<br>
keep your eye upon the dougnut
<br>
not upon the hole.
<br>
<br>
I realise there are many questions asked on the thread still not answered, and apologise. If anything is of particular importance to you, feel free to PM me or write
<a class="bbc_email" href="mailto:Davidmustardseed@hotmail.com">

</a>
. If you need prayers for anything or if you feel that I could in any way help or counsel you about anything, I shall be sure to answer you as soon as my schedule permits. I would also like to ask any of you who pray or meditate to send a little prayers and "good vibrations" my way as well. I am facing some very big challenges at this point of my life and could sure need some of that "stuf"[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
].
<br>
<br>
It is my hope that you will all remember this thread and that it will encourage you in your personal life, to spend a little time talking to GOD, when you feel lonely confused unloved or afraid. He will answer you. He has promised us all this.....: "Ask and it shall be given to you, seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you." but do not forget that "he that comes to God must believe that He is and that he is a rewarder of those who dilligently seek Him". Believe and you will recieve.

I just read a tiny bit of this thread. You've sure been doing this for a long looong time so it can't be all made up(unless you're a proffesional comedian and this was a way to exercise).

 Nope, sorry, this thread does nothing for me. The fact is, anyone can channel 'God' if they so wish because 'God' is all around us and in us. God is the consciousness of all that has been, all that is and all that will be and anyone, if they so wish, can access this knowledge and awareness.

CHANNELING GOD
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I am here and have some questions.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Ok lets have'm
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well its a question about hate and about the baggage we as people bring with us in life
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Yea it sure mounts up doesn't it
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes it does and that's the problem. It seems such a defeat and sometimes I seem to never get the victory....why is that?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 OK well before I answer why don't you think this over first. If you had no problems to overcome and everything went along like a song how do you think it would affect you
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ha that's easy I would be happy
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 are you sure
</span>
<br>
<br>
Absolutely
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 and then what would you do
</span>
<br>
<br>
I would get on with my life
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Doing what If I may ask
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I don't know....living life I guess. I would be happier and would make others happier.....I suppose
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Doing what
</span>
<br>
<br>
Hey God you told me I could ask the questions
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 You wanna be in charge....be my guest
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK so why don't you make things better for me...I am hurting
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 I was trying to let you answer that question
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Think about that Mustardseed.....why would I do that
</span>
<br>
<br>
Umm ....I don't know, do you want to make it difficult for me
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Nope that's not it
</span>
<br>
<br>
So why
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 I want to help you to learn and grow
</span>
<br>
<br>
But I am not growing I am having a bad time
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Wrong again
</span>
<br>
<br>
What do you mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 I mean wrong again ......you ARE growing..that's my point
</span>
<br>
<br>
Oh so its a test of sorts
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 A test in a way but its not the most accurate way of explaining it
</span>
<br>
<br>
I feel we are playing ask the Professor
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 We are ha
</span>
<br>
<br>
So Professor.....should I take it as a exercise or something?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Mustardseed I am not the Professor....you are
</span>
<br>
<br>
So I should ask myself
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 That's right
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK so what have I learned through the bad stuf I have gone through...... I guess a lot about myself, and others and how things should not be
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 And here you Mustardseed stumbled on a great truth. If I had wanted to fix you I would have, but I see deeper than you, and this life and the problems you encounter works for you as a far more important life lesson. I allow stuff to happen my friend, so you can learn to trust, and to see the good in things that do not appear good, to see light when all appears dark and to see love when all appears to be hate and selfishness, I do this because my goal is that YOU grow, and that you get prepared for what is ahead. Nothing that is worth something comes free and some of the deepest and most profound spiritual lessons come from some of the deepest and darkest experiences you have to go through. I try the hearts of men, and in so doing I show them the answer.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Hmm......really
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Really
</span>
<br>
<br>
So you mean it well by allowing it?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Of cause but you will only see the good if you are able to tune in to the good. Two men look out through the same bars one sees the mud one sees the stars. It is all in the way you see things, and in what you decide to call your reality
</span>
<br>
<br>
I see so I need to see it as a good thing then and it will help me grow
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 You betcha
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK I guess I will think a bit about that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 You go ahead and do that and remember the outlook may not be that great but the up look is always super
</span>
<br>
<br>
Thanks .......... I really need to think more about that, talk to you later
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 You just call out my name....and you know ..... I love that song
</span>
<br>
<br>
Huh
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 Yea whats wrong with that, I love songs....lets talk about that another time you gotta go
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK  bye God
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 CU later Mustardseed

</span>
<br>
<br>
Oh... okay...
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So, what can I do for you?
</span>
<br>
<br>
Can you give me this Saturday's winning lottery numbers?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Really? That's great!
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Heh, don't look so surprised. I am God, you know.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Of course. So... what are they?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 What?
</span>
<br>
<br>
What are the numbers?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Oh you meant... oh, ahahaha!
</span>
<br>
<br>
What's so funny?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well of course I "can" give you Saturday's numbers. Did you think I was actually going to?
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why not? I thought I once heard about a certain someone saying "ask and ye shall receive," or something...?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Oh yeah...
 <i>
  that
 </i>
 .
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yeah?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I'm pretty sure my son was drunk when we said that. He went to a lot of weddings and parties, you know. You can't quote everything the man said. Life just doesn't work that way.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Oh... well, how does it work?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ahhh... good question!
</span>
<br>
<br>
I thought so.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well... how would you want it to work?
</span>
<br>
<br>
God, I don't think you can ask that question of me... my wants and desires are categorically the wants and desires of a living thing and therefore undistinguished from how life already works.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Wow... that was great. I don't think I could've said it better myself.
</span>
<br>
<br>
So, will you give them to me?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 And miss watching your own independent attempts? Hell no! You should see what you look like from here. You're like some little kitten trying to walk up a 40 foot hill covered in ice.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, I bet it's really entertaining. Well, I'm glad I'm making you smile, at least!
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 No problem! I imagine this won't get old for another 30 or 40 years.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well sit down and get comfortable. Tickets are cheap.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Says you. How many have you bought so far?
</span>
<br>
<br>
204... there was that night I bought 200 after winning so much at craps. It was worth the experiment.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You do realize what that looked like from up here. It looked like you got an extra foot up the hill before slipping and sliding back down.
</span>
<br>
<br>
I don't see the usefulness in talking to you if you're just going to make fun of me.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Hey, Telos. Is it cold in Hell?
</span>

What?

Mustardseed, are we channeling the same God?
<br>
<br>
I mean this very seriously. Every time I ask God questions, I find his answers reactionary, boldly and honestly critical, with a hint of defensiveness but cunningly offensive. And scathingly good humored. Maybe that's because I was raised Catholic.
<br>
<br>
But I think I force him to be on his toes because I don't let him hide anything. What do you think?

Hi Telos
<br>
I really have no idea if we do channel the same God, I thought there was only one, but maybe I am mistaken.......it would not be the first time. Anyway, I was not brought up Catholic so wouldn't know. About the humor,......... still .....no idea. I channel what I channel. No jokes, take it for what it is. Poke fun if you will, no harm intended from my side. I have always appreciated  your posts and have no bones with you at all, honestly. This thread has always been a sore point with some people, you should read the earlier posts. I know its a long thread but interesting nevertheless, cant help that controversy, sorry.
<br>
<br>
If you can to your own self be true, you can not be false to any man.
<br>
<br>
some great guy said that, cant remember who , Kipling or Franklin or someone, yet, nevertheless it stands to reason.....
<br>
<br>
I am not adverse to your posts, so feel free by all means. Its all just interesting to me.
<br>

Ps and Telos by all means do feel free to keep God on his toes, I dont think he minds.

<section>
Thank you, Mustardseed. That was a very kind response. I'm sorry for not reading the earlier pages (there is quite a few!).
<br>
<br>
When I channel God as having almost the characteristics of a bully, I suppose he is reminding me (or I am reminding myself?) that God is in the bully at school. God is in the racist next door. And God is in the atheist that pokes fun at people believing in God. I find that simultaneously comforting and disturbing, and I want more from God about that ;) Combine that with my no-holds-barred interpretation of "ask and ye shall receive," well... I feel like God is dancing to hide his shadow. And he may be a good dancer!
<br>
<br>
I mention the Catholic thing because Catholics can be very mighty in their education of young people to accept the doctrines of the faith. When asked very legitimate questions on legitimacy of certain doctrines, combined with interpretations of scripture and the validity of the scripture itself, or (God forbid) the authority of the papacy, they sort of dance around, trying to hide their shadow.
<br>
<br>
I hope I did not offend you. (I know you said I didn't, but there it is anyway :) ).
<br>
<br>
It's good reading your posts.

I find this very offensive. Mustardseed, if you are making this all up, then I think you should own up. I do recall a thread about 'channeling god' with the blue and the red text and the person admitted that they were just making it up to see if people would try it themselves, because if they could then everyone could or something....
<br>
Either way, I find this as a spiritual counterfeit, whether you think you are speaking to God or not . . . I suggest that you pray to God and ask for him to show you the truth and help you, because I can see how this 'channeling God' thing can go very wrong.

 I find this very offensive
</i>
<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate if people find this thread offensive, but they don't have to read it if they find it goes against their orthodoxies. This is a free board does not restrict itself to a single religious creed or enforced doctrine; we're sorry if this does not please some but we are a civilised board and we have to live with it.
<br>
<br>
It is clear that Mustardseed wished to experiment with attempts to channel god and wished to post his results here for others to comment on. Everyone is free to agree/disagree with his findings and discuss other aspects of them, but just because a few 'find it offensive' is no reason for mustardseed to stop what he is doing. Many other members find it very interesting, regardless of what they make of it.
<br>
<br>
If people come across posts they have problems with, but do not violate the commonly set bounds of board decency, then there is nothing they can do about it, but they don't have to read it!

<section>
Mustardseed, I've skipped from page 8 to here for a reason.  As you know from my other posts elsewhere I'm not inclined to "deep" spirituality or beliefs-actually systemised belief makes me quite annoyed/uncomfortable for some reason.
<br>
<br>
Anyway the reason I'm typing to you, and I really don't know what I am meant to be saying to you is that something you wrote earlier hit a sensitive chord in me.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 If any of you want to ask anything of me ask for spiritual gifts to aid others, the gifts of love to heal and the gifts of dicernment to be forearmed and vigilant and if asked in a right spirit I will surely answer such a prayer. I am more willing to give than you are to recieve.
</blockquote>
<br>
This one for some reason.  Basically in another thread in Astral Consciousness I mentioned touching something you might call "God".  During that time-which was about 20 mins (I only know this because I was driving at the time so I know how far I drove.) I also asked questions of whatever it was.  The one thing I did say was to make a request I sort of believe is slightly out of character for me.  Basically I really really wanted the power to heal that I have worked on to grow stronger, more certain and for it to  always work for those who wish me to use it on their behalf. That's the essence of what I asked. That left me in floods of tears and now as I write the tears are starting again. WHAT GIVES!?..
<br>
<br>
normally I've played with energy work because I like the sensations. The chi kung and similar because of how my body feels. The use of this for healing because I like the effect the success has on me and the patient both.   I just like doing it. No altruism is being intended consciously, I'm not some really unselfish holy type at all. The opposite. Outside of my relationship I'm 90% self centred, I don't have a regular job because I don't have to work much, I refuse to because I want to energy train, physically train and do my own pursuits. So I don't do charity work or anything like that-though others have said I "should".   I'm mentioning this to give you some idea of how I am.  Basically apart from enjoying the sensation of healing and energy work etc, what gives with the spirit thing? I was a skeptic outside of healing but now I have something more to consider-I kinda want to-but I don't want to become some "etheric" type or oh I don't know
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
, I'm not really sure what I'm on this thread for...except that I've had regular tears of joy experiences for the past few weeks and have conscious choice to have them...so if you are really channelling God and you have faith enough in what you are doing-just would you ask him/her/it what gives with me here? I'm trying like crazy to avoid the "special" syndrome, the "touched" syndrome, "messiah" syndrome and similar ego things. I guess whilst I enjoy the buzz and the emotional intensity I don't want to be "crazy"-but be real... actually, maybe can you ask if he/her/it knows what it is I want to ask?
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.   I don't trust myself to know if I've got answers just yet...but right now my heart centre is going like crazy and I know I'd only need to concentrate a little and the crown will strobe...
<br>
<br>
Seriously, I don't want to grasp things to believe in. I want to be "real". Does it make sense here?
<br>
<br>
btw the act of "prayer" as I understand it really makes me feel cheesy-especially as I avoid all "religion" like the plague-NO OFFENSE INTENDED ANYONE-PERSONAL REASONS/BELIEFS/FEELINGS. So um...is communicating whilst in the middle of healing rapture a good idea?
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
opinion sort-yours will do if God doesn't feel the need to answer

CHANNELING GOD
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK God I am back and it seems that a few people have been here as well
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yep I see that , and yep I see the people as well. Ha
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Ha What?
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Religious people always say......talk to God about it, take it to God , speak to God about your problems......and when anyone does they get offended
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Yea I saw that guy, he sounded like some of the guys early on , but its not all bad ...he reminded me that I used to write red.....so that was a good thing, how about the other guy?
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 He is OK, very open minded in many ways but a little close minded in others, of the making of books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Are you talking about Karnautral
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Nope the guy with the funny hat, ha
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 oh I get it Gandalf, I know him a bit, he is fair and always very factual that's a good thing
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes it can be ........
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I wanna ask about the other guy though, and those feelings he has, or whatever it is
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 whats it all about
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 tapping in
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 huh
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Tapping in to my Spirit
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Is that what he did......but he does not even believe in you
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well as someone said......I believe in Him.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 can you explain how it works
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure. Its like this, My Spirit is like a waterfall always flowing, just beyond the veil. Sometimes people inadvertently access this my power through selfless thoughts of love and compassion and for a brief moment they feel me, even if they do not even touch the water. They get sprinkled on so to speak, a mist a vapor, yet they know they have been touched, my spirit tells them
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I see so that's what happened
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yep
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so what should he do about it....anything?
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well its up to him.......always is
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 yea I remember you are strong on free will
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yep...... I am
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so is there anything else to say about that
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 not a whole lot. It is up to people to follow. I mark the trail, yet they still have to have the faith to travel that trail. By the way that Karnautral should talk more to me, but he feels foolish as he has had his mind made up so long that I don't exist.....ha.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 he has
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yes but that is OK...not a problem. If he wants to receive all he has to do is ask, if he wants the door to open all he has to do is knock and if he wants to find....he has to do a little looking around...that's the way it works. You have to have an object in mind before you can search for it. Not knowing what you are looking for is confusion, its just driving around without a goal. He should ask himself what he is looking for, then he can start searching with a focused mind.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK I will tell  him.....well I guess you already have ha I forgot how it works. See you later then
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK see you

<section>
Questions for God :
<br>
<br>
Why do I get so angry and fedup with spiritual boards in general ? Why does a conversation supposedly aimed at the "spiritual" almost always ends up putting my stomach in knots ? (I guess it's the same with the political discussions).
<br>
<br>
Remember my youth, God ? When I read that book about Jean-Paul Sartre, and this thing he called bad faith ? I fell in love with the concept. Ever since I go around with my "bad faith radar". Sometimes I catch myself acting in bad faith, but, naturally, with this high opinion I have of myself, I most often detect it in others. Many conversations become imo useless, people defend views that do not challenge what they have to do, or specifically *not* do, it's always the fault of the *governements*, they always have some conspiracy theory at hand, then they think that everything will change when 1% of the population will get it "spiritually", they still talk about that urban legend of the 100 monkes.
<br>
<br>
They read books that preach to the converted : they think a book is great when the book reflects their views, when the book is some kind of confirmation of what they think -- from an external "trusted enough to be published" source. People are just lazy, intellectually and plainly... lazy.
<br>
And I am too, just like them. Which brings me to question 2 (if you could understand question 1).
<br>
<br>
I certainly have a difficult time putting my hands where my head is. I really want to do something, really do, and I don't do it. I want, for example, badly to contact an old friend, but precisely because I miss him very much, I wait till I am less "in want" and end up not calling him. As soon as the "want" is formulated, felt consciously, there seems to be a myriad of opposing forces... is that Satan ? Is that what we call Satan? Lack of courage ? Not doing something BECAUSE we decided to do it.
<br>
It's resistance, but not just that. Sometimes I feel like sleeping through my entire life. I resist to most kinds of investment, and "wanting". Buddhism attracts me : I want to take myself away from wanting, envy, ambition, I don't want to be caught up with any kind of ambition, except maybe the one that makes a positive difference in the world. But do I ?
<br>
<br>
Where does the resistance comes from ? You do seem like rewarding me with my effort, I admit. If I give enough, I get back. If I spend enough time working on something, the motivation gets stronger, and the inspiration too. But that might very well be only psychological.
<br>
<br>
I have decided to put you on a shelf. It's no time to talk about you, who cares about you now ? So many people are giving you a bad name. I'd rather pretend to be an atheist and have rational conversations where
<br>
you are not involved, if you don't mind. Do you approve ? Do you need me to worship you openly ? I don't think so. I have spoken about you in vain and vanity, time to stop now, and stand on my own 2 feet of rational thinking.
<br>
<br>
One of my teachers at the university said I was very rational, and it hurts. It seems almost like a fault to have : you are either rational, or creative. Well organized or creative. Boring or creative. So God, what should I do ? Maybe I should do a boring job, maybe that's what I am good at, organize those that are creative ?
<br>
<br>
I am angry God, why am I angry ? Why do I hate Americans ? But wait... why do I hate myself and others (it's usually in sync). I am disgusted by our human nature. This inertia. Not that we are bad people. We're good people, we are just .. well it seems like we don't have free will... we talk and act like robots... under the control of habit.
<br>
<br>
Also, I thank you for having taken sex away from me. It's one part of the equation that made the whole think suck for me, now it's out, and I thank you for that, no irony meant here. You know what I mean, right ?
<br>
(reference to a few days ago). Better without lust.

CHANNELING GOD
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Flannery wrote a lot
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes she wrote a lot......thought a lot too
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well do you have anything for her
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 The plight of a searching heart.....the human condition
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I don't understand
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That's OK this is not for you
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 oh...ok
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 In much seeking is much grief, the life you have been given is often confusing and unless spiritually discerned it will seem unorganized and without direction
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 to everyone
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 as I said, unless spiritually discerned....yes, and even then it can at times be a puzzle. It is like Morse code, unless you know there is a message and someone is sending the signal it just sounds like ,......a interference....gibberish and nonessential sounds, yet if you have the key it unlocks the message. The spiritual life must be that way, to some it makes no sense so that in hearing they do not understand and in seeing they do not comprehend.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 sounds very cryptic
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 that's a very good word to describe it
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 really
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yes...life is a mystery, and I love a mystery
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK so its up to us to figure things out.....but that is the whole point sometimes life makes no sense
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 not to you it doesn't at least not at the time you go through it
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so what should she do
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 she should keep looking .....and she is, that is good. The only mistake she can make is giving up. Life is not what it is made up to be, there is a deeper level of living, deeper than most people comprehend. Sometimes it takes years for things to make sense, sometimes a split second. It has to do with focus. He that comes to me must believe that I am and that I am and that I am a rewarder of those who diligently seek me.....note diligently. This is a very misunderstood concept. I am not found in books, I am not found in self manipulation, my Spirit dwells in places often overlooked. The kind smile to a stranger, the selfless deed the trusting heart or the love shown in secret. I am like a bank of sorts, no withdrawing without deposits you could say, and yet around in every sphere, the chatter of voices thoughts and intents oceans of mindless self serving energy .....wasted. Focus is fixing your mind on a point, do few things and do them well, make habits good habits to drown out the voices and in doing so she will lay a seed that will blossom into a tree, the tiniest of seeds, yet a mighty tree......you should know
</span>

 Oh I get it ha yes I guess I should
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 what would you tell Flannery, and Karnautral, and all the others
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I don't know....I don't think I could tell them much
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Go ahead give it a shot
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK well.......I guess I then would say that if I understand you correctly.....life is sometimes confusing, at least it is to me, but in times of confusion they should focus on things that they KNOW are right and then just keep doing that till things get less confusing....I guess
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Pretty good
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Well that's all fine but what are the things that are right then
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 what are they for you my friend
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I think that in times when I go through it I concentrate on the little things....you actually told me that before, sometime ago. I try my best to avoid introspection and analyzing too much, take time to speak to strangers, building others up and helping those who have fallen on hard times. It always helps me to get my eyes off myself and my own problems
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 In this you have stumbled on a great truth, ´for it is in giving you receive it is in loving you are loved and it is in letting go you will be held unto...by me, be an instrument of my peace and you widen the channel I use to speak to you, you deepen it so my Spirit can flow to you in the same Chanel in much greater me messure , no good deed is wasted no kind word will be overlooked, for by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 we will be condemned...that does not sound so nice
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Every man will be his own judge and one day you will see your life rolled out as a scroll, in that day we will take a look at it together. Don't worry about that...it is a good thing
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 oh yea
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 that worries you right
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 a bit .....but listen I gotta go

At one point I wanted to avoid doing something that was senseless for me. The only way out was to get sick, the other option was to abandon 3 classes, which had consequences that I did not like, i.e. kissing goodbye to about 4,000$, anyway, God, you know my situation, this is more for Mustardseed - so I got sick, really sick. Thank you God. You gave me a ticket out, and I never regretted it. Now I am weary of something again, and I am getting sick... again. But should avoid what I have to do ?
<br>
It has to do with helping someone else with their ambition. A project where a person is kept isolated for 4 days, without food, in a glass jar, exposed to people walking down the street. To get attention, that's the goal. Get public attention. As we expect (hope, for some people) that the person that lives in such isolation will have a fit. We'll get him psychological help before and after. I volonteered with programming. I don't like the project so much anymore.
<br>
<br>
Is there a danger of sleeping too much ? I dream a lot, I sleep during the day mostly, because I wake up early now, with the sun. I have this habit of going to McDonald in the morning : my goal is to get out of the house with the sun. It's very slippery outside with my crutches, so I drive to a place that's cheap and open at this early hour and where I can sit and eat and read and write. ( I know it sounds bad to people : going to McDonald.. heeshh, well forget it, scroll down.. for Mustardseed : the filter coffee is good, and like I said it's cheap, and I AM cheap, that's why I can survive with a little.)
<br>
<br>
God, I value freedom, even when I don't know what to do with it. There is some shame in it : why should I be free ? What is it about me that I deserve to be on my own, independant ? Sounds like vanity, rebellion without a cause. But I think I need it, I am convinced I do : need lots of free time. To write. Which is another delusion. Been with me for so long that I feel as if it's written somewhere. New age people would say that I established a contract, before birth, that my life's purpose is so and so, which includes writing. Not so. I want to be an artist and live a bohemian life because I am selfish and think highly of myself and want to be free-free-free, as if I am part of some aristicratic class, above everyone else who has to have a job they don't really like, etc.
<br>
<br>
God, how can I pay you back? Where's my place in this world where I am not only a parasite but helpful ? What's my purpose ?
<br>
<br>
Just filled out a stupid questionnaire to find out how my chakras are...
<br>
don't laugh... seems like my head down to my neck is o.k. but everything below is closed. Of course the questionnaire sees as "wrong" the fact that someone doesn't express himself sexually, but that's another manner.
<br>
What are God's views about sex ? Is sex there only for procreation ?
<br>
(what's the pupose ? It seems it brings as smuch pleasure as pain, sometimes more pain, and I mean desire, lust...)

Very well, I have just a couple questions.  Since meditating, reading about Buddha, studying theology and believing in Jesus my view on life has gotten 100% better.  So what can I do to better improve myself and those around me?  And when will I finally meet a spirit guide or my higher self when I OBE?

CHANNELING GOD
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Someone is asking how they can better themselves....I guess you saw the question
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I did
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well then
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Its not so complicated Mustardseed. The problem in bettering oneself as he calls it is, that it is not in studying learning and doing a lot of good things, that changes occur. The real change occurs when a person is so filled with my spirit and gives me so much leeway in their lives that they are finally able to be ME for each other.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Be you, how can someone be you....you are God
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 true but in a deeper sense of the word I am whoever I live in as well, people cannot see me, they can only see me in the love shown by those who loves me, and they in a way become my love for each other. Faith and hope, spiritual gifts and self sacrifice is nothing without my love. They are all good if they are done as unto me but any other motive will make them useless and vain. I mentioned that earlier in our conversation
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I think I remember that actually....somewhere back there. The thread is getting so long
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 The world is full of people doing the right things for the wrong reasons, and when they do they gain nothing. I scope the heart and I see more than man. Anyway studying is a good beginning, it is in a way like preparing for the battle, much can be said for getting things ready ahead of time, but the real test is in how much the studies are lived
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 What about his spirit guide when will he meet them or it or whatever
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Have you noticed how people all want the perfect life. They always talk in therms of perfect. She is a perfect 10 he is a perfect mate etc.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Yes but what does that have to do with the question
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 everything....people should consider this closer. Life is not a perfect set of orderly organized events, all lined up sometimes it appears a mess but the real issue is the process
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I still don't understand what that has to do with the question he asked...sorry
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 The future of man is made up of the decisions and actions taken in the presence, it is not a set future, and so he will naturally have these experiences when he is ready, it depends on a lot of factors. Man has the ability to change a defeat into a victory, death into life, a useless existence into joy full living and when the pins are all ready I roll the ball. Think about it
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 all right then....I hope it makes sense to him
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 so do I Mustardseed ...so do I.....he has a good start
</span>
<br>
<br>
PS someone wrote me a PM I will get to that soon, a bit busy at the moment, thanks for writing

Well this is a good thread so far. Interesting answers you give Mustardseed. None of them are of "Christian" push ethic either, for that I thank you and have some trust of what is being said even
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.
<br>
<br>
My brother was able to observe me doing the thing where I get tears from sending the healing. He told me something real strange.  I start off white anyway to his "sight" (He has to close his eyes to "see" energy".) I get brighter, which is normal for energy work, however more white comes down from above-he describes it as coming from an energy band he feels is all around the Earth - high up..
<br>
<br>
All I know is today I was able to keep sending from the heart chakra to people-people I passed in cars etc etc for ages with the whole strobing, tears of joy thing etc...
<br>
ach I don't know... Will he tell you if this is something to do with some kind of partnership here? one where I acknowledge His/Her/It's presence and open to allow my intention to send healing and his/her will to flow with it? I can't express what I am knowing properly so there's some arrogance in the statement that I do not intend. All I know is I'm talking from a sense that I can't fully vocalise..is he willing to reveal anything to me via you here? I not quite trusting of my own verbal channeling ability.

 You know  God....I am not sure I understand the question above....do you
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Emotions are funny things Mustardseed, feelings are what set you all aside, just a little lower than the angels. Think about that just a little lower
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I thought they were far more ....well above us i a  way
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Not so, the only real difference is that they have been made with a set tuned station so to speak, you have to develop yours, through trial and error. He is all ready acknowledging me, he knows it as well. Nothing good, no loving sweet helpful and mercy full act can be even conceived without me being involved somewhere. People think its all their own idea, ha that's fine with me. I don't need a spin doctor or pr team to testify to my part. People feel it in their heart, if they listen. When they have been in touch with my spirit, there is a certain feel to it,and as they pass it on, others feel it as well...... they were "touched by an angel" in the flesh, for everyone who does my bidding is an angel in my realm.

I hope that everything is o.k. with you. That temperatures are warming up where you are. That you don't overwork yourself, and don't let the scorpio in you get too dark about matters of life.
<br>
<br>
If you have the time I have a general question for God. Maybe it's been answered before, it might sound like a cliché, but it does come up for me.
<br>
<br>
Why is it that you let people do "terrible things" in your name ? Some people seem to be sincere in feeling guided by you to do things that, to other people at least, are questionable. In my country, some gents fear the fondamentalist christianism in the States. What do you do about all this ? People getting very "hot" with you, yet becoming increasingly judgmental. That's what I mean (also). I know that we have to judge the "infuence" by the fruits. But some people don't see the same fruits as others. They see a rotten fruit where someone sees a beautiful fruit, and vice versa.
<br>
<br>
Also, if time permits, is there really any such thing as free will ? Aren't we, at any moment, the perfect and logical product of our past, of everything that lead up to this moment, and aren't our actions and decisions also, often just as unknowingly, the product of our environment (which is also the product of the past), our chemistry, genes, hormones, caffeine consumption, digestion and all those biological things...? Take pms for example
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
It's an easy shot, but you know what I mean ? Our brain is constantly on drugs : natural and not so natural drugs, but mostly natural drugs produced by our bodies. We have learn reactions to stimuli, to certain events, etc... so where is the free will exactly ?
<br>
If we see the limits, the actual limits of everybody's free will, isn't there more room for compassion ? Compassion for ourselves and others I mean. We ignore the circumstances of other people, more often than not. Who are we to judge ?

Here is your next subject:
<br>
<br>
God, why does your personality, voice, and insight differ between channelers? How is the absolute truth between mediums
<i>
 absolute
</i>
if it is inconsistent to another absolute truth, or vaguely related. As an independent, non-religious christian, I am confused by the traditional and modern interpretations of the Messiah, that he is the only way to God and those who do not believe he saved us cannot live in God or enter Heaven. Yet, we are all sons of God who will move on after death. Yet Christ is the Savior? What exactly has Christ "saved" us from, if not from entering heaven if we are already entitled to it? In short, I cannot seem to fathom a connection between fundamental Christian belief that "Christ is the only way" to the more open-minded wisdom that seems to make more sense.

CHANNELING GOD
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 There were some questions, very good questions actually about the different channelers and why what they channel is sometimes different or inconsistent
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK so let us talk about that then,
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Well why is that
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 There are many different reasons for this. Channeling prophesying or hearing from Me is not so easy for some it all depends
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 depends on what
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 The interference
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 interference by who..... or what
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha ...mostly by people themselves
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 you mean people get mixed up
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yes...sometimes people mix up my voice with their own thoughts or their own logic.Pride arrogance and self righteousness also play a role. I am neither proud arrogant nor am I always conceived to mortal men. My truths are often revealed to those poor in spirit, it all depends on the channel, the purity and the desire to hear from ME and that of putting their own thoughts away. Most people have a hard time doing that, this is why so many should learn to study to be quiet,my will not theirs my message not theirs. Imagine a large painting, if one focus in on only a corner a detail it looks as if it is a different scene all together, so in order to hear from me you must often come back several times, ask again, hear again, open minded and without preconceived ideas, after a while a larger picture will form.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK that sounds interesting, actually I have had that happen to me several times, I think I know what you want me to do and that I have heard your voice but to be sure I ask again
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes this thread is a good example of the greater picture
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 what about the fundamentalists and their views
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 People like to think they own me, .......they have me all figured out, and the rules are clear ....and everyone likes to be on  a winning team. It is so easy that way, being saved becomes a club, a physical thing almost keep these rules say these words judge all others, but my truth runs deeper than this
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so these folks are ....well what are they
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 they are learning and growing like you all are, learning that my truth cannot fit in a box and a building cannot hold my spirit for what building will they build for me , Heaven is my throne and earth my footstool and I do not live in buildings temples made by man, but I dwell in the secret places in the heart.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so some of those fundamentalists.......they are wrong
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 some will come to me and say in your name we did cast out demons did great works so give us our reward and in that day I will say hey back off you missed the point.....you did not do it for love, there will be weeping at that time when people realize how much more important things they could have done, had they only loved
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 and the thing about Jesus.....what are people to be saved from
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 themselves. When all is counted and a life is measured when the last day is at hand and the scroll is opened you will judge yourself, I judge no man, at least not at that point,at the end of a life a man is judged by the very life he lived. Being saved is having faith in this truth that I AM, love anyone who loves knows me and anyone who does not love knows me not....its that simple. Through this love, MY love, and not yours man can connect with me and in doing so transcend his own inability, the human condition, for the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 is that it
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 ha well part of the picture.....as I said its a big picture. The secret is in the heart and in the motive. The best and most perfect man who has lived supposedly a life for me can die and have a lot to learn and the simplest humble weakest man can die and go straight to my presence, for to whom much has been given of him shall be much required and to the one with the lesser gifts less is expected ......another part of the picture
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 sounds a bit complicated to be
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well think about it and by the way get back to work....I have a ride for you....someone I want you to meet
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK ....let me close down bye God
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 till later my friend

Yaldabaoth. Is this GOD you are in communication with Yaldabaoth, the Gnostic demiurge? If not, where does Yaldabaoth fit in?
<br>
<br>
Secondly, Why was El's gate destroyed at the tower of babel?
<br>

Is God still angry with El? (El being the lofty top dog of the elohim in the Canaanite pantheon)

God, is it possible that you are nothing more than the product of the channeler's imagination. I understand that imagination is the software that allows the two languages of ours and the divine to be translated. We receive insight and our imagination processes it into something we understand. What is the possibility that you, God, are such a product of this translation?

 He is
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 so how about you help me out with my questions
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 you ask the question and I will see if I can answer.....yes you heard right I will see if I can answer
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 hey.....I thought you could answer anything, whats that all about
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I have certain rules that I stick to, just to keep myself in check, mostly so no one will get hurt you included. You wont get it so don't ask about that stick to that other question
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 ........OK well what is reality, is this life as we know it only a construct and how does it all work, with phasing etc
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK so let me get this right.....you would like me t tell you how the universe is screwed together, how I did it and how I continue to do it in other words give you the secret of eternity
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well ......yes If it would be OK with you....I would like to know
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK.....but only if you can keep it a secret and not tell everybody
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well this is a public forum so I guess others will read it
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 ha....no deal.
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 but how do you want t do it then
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Just kiddin Mustardseed, to be honest no can do. Think about what you are asking for, the secrets of the universe the kernel to the whole thing. I cant do that but I can do something else
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 OK well what can you do then
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I can tell you where to start looking
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well....ok
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Think about it this way, the power and energy of the universe is like a mighty current, all the rivers of the world all the wind all the fire, its like nature. Everyone has a part in nature everyone experiences nature in some way and everyone has a construct from where to do this. The guy who has a nice house looks through the window into the garden from HIS constructION and observes, some want to get closer and live in a camper or a boat, they experience more of nature and are more in the midst of the elements. Some want to go and become one with nature and live in a tent, they are really at the mercy of the elements and some just decide to sleep under a tree making that their construct.Nature is force full, so are my truths and I  have made it so that they are best enjoyed and experienced from within a construct. No scientist would do much good without a frame work from where he could examine what he collects, so its all for your own good
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 but what about lets say a very fundamentalist construct
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 that's the whole point, some people forget about the rivers the forests and the wind and weather. They live TOTALLY with in a man made environment, they solidify and forget ME they freeze in their conformity and they say to themselves, this is our world we see the whether on TV stay inside when its bad and only expose ourselves to the nice things, a bit of sun on the veranda, Sunday morning service. We have the answers to how it works in our remote control
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 its all a lot.....but you say that we all have some kind of construct.....does that include Frank.....he seems to have a lot of answers
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 he is just a little closer to the reality of nature, he accepts the fact that he is only one in a line of explorers a tiny link in the chain, someone else will come after him and go further and understand more, but he should change his question
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 what do you mean
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 He should not only ask how......also why, as I said before so much of the answer is in the motive
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 well......I don't understand that so you will have to tell him that
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 just did
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 then there is the questions about the experience I had
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 ask Frank
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 ask Frank.....I just did he sent me to ask you, it would not be so nice to go back and say you didn't know, ....God
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 don't get fresh with me MS......ask Frank what he thinks
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 this is very embarressing......
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I think it is funny......so does Frank.....good sense of humor he's got..........note to self, "create future explorers with good amount of humor, it works well"
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Note to self.....come on this is getting too long anyway I gotta go
</span>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 ok CYA

<br>
What if you wrote that into your life? What if the experience of being single and experiences associated with the confusion of being single were intended? Sylvia Brown, a well-respected author, like Robert Bruce, claims that we write it into our charts these experiences we go through.
<br>
<br>
I wonder why I'm still single and why my social life is so stuck in limbo. The only logical reason is that that one special someone hasn't come by yet, but it still feels like a make-shift answer.

  Anyway, Mustard Seed / God

, that didn't answer Frank's question. You're speaking in poetic metaphors, which really tells us what we already knew to begin with. Since you are the intellectual God, and all-knowing, you already fathom the legitimacy of Frank's challenge. At least go into some detail about the physical, scientific fundamentals of how the universe was concieved. Science is inspiried through the spiritual,
<br>
so why all the games and charades? Why are the world's most intellectually complicated questions unanswerable? Why must we climb
<br>
the mountain only to be told that the answers are there but are too good for us to know? Why is it okay to give us information by the most obscure means but it is not okay to give us the information we want when we contact you by direct means and ask for it? If the information
<br>
is there in the Askashic, anyone could simply access it and discover the cure for cancer (if not the idea / inspired idea from reviewing the instructions for the cure in the Ashkashic). So why can't this information be directly communicated and provided? Why are we given the shaft?
<br>
<br>
Are you too good for us, God?
<br>
<br>
Is there a reason why a few paragraphs on the nature of dark matter cannot be revealed, or perhaps some cryptic clues given to us to ponder over, inspire, and contemplate?
<br>
<br>
Also, if you are the almighty God, why are you not the fundamentalist bible God? How can you be the God that was written, but is not at present? Why are you a silent God that forsakes us to our own devices? Why are you a helpless God that writes about empowerment through other individuals. Why do you remain the silent God that disappeared after ages of walking on the earth based on those teachings?

I was a little disappointed with god's response, I was hoping for a bit more confirmation from him/her about the current structure of our system. I realise there are limitations in this particular style of engagement, and I would like to thank you for sharing. Also, it was not my intention to upset you in any way. I spent a long time developing my Phasing Model of Consciousness, so naturally I am a tad "protective" of it. :)

If I have caused you upset then I apologise.

First I have to say that I jus typed somethin to search for to see what I would get, and then I ended up picking this thread to look at.  Had nothing to do with what I was searching for, yet from what I read, some of my questions were kinda answered.  I feel that maybe God gave me a little kick over here, because im sure he knows what i've been thinking lately.  I'd jus like to ask a little question...
<br>
<br>
Now I know you say you are "The God of Flesh" i believe, and I've seen your views on religions, so you must know that I am Christian.  You knowing everything due to u creating it lol, you must know the bible.  My question has to do with the book in the bible, Revelations.  now it says in there or with what I heard in church that after the rapture, that the old heaven and earth will be passed away, and a new one will be formed.  Well i lied, that is not what i want to ask, because i actually had a feeling of how you would answer.  did you have the bible written, especially the book, Revelation, to let people that believe have a little clue as to what will happen after death? (and im sure you know what i mean when i say those that believe lol)
<br>
<br>
and i ended up wanting to ask you something else, but after writing all that i forget
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
maybe i will remember later then i will ask you.
<br>
<br>
And thank you Mustardseed for doing this thread, it is really interesting and kinda fun.  I believe more and more about you and communicating with god the more I read this.

Dear Frank
<br>
First of all no offense taken, none at all. I think the thing about getting to me was in reference to your asking such an obvious question. That's all. Yes there do seem to be some limitations to this type of engagements, and I don't quite know how it works. For your information and anyone else as well, I do not take myself so seriously and certainly not the thread. I do honestly in prayer ask the questions and then I type what I get....that's about it. At times it gets a bit vague for me as well, ha . Somewhere in the thread there was a very interesting answer touching on this. It seemed to indicate that "God" works in a sort om symbiosis with my mind or spirit if you will and the one who asks the question. It seems more to have to do with my inability to receive any more than my mind can comprehend. I often wondered why I could never get direct answers to things like math problems or lotto numbers etc . I guess I just don't have the faith to ask those questions!!! .
<br>
<br>
On the other hand I do think that it is evident from the thread that the voice is very consistently the same throughout, and furthermore I seem to get bolder the longer I do it, so maybe there is a learning curve somehow as with so many other things.
<br>
<br>
All in all it is my impression that "God" is just sweetly and lightly bringing me along, with a lightheartedness and patience much the same as my image or understanding of "Him", based on my own Christian belief system. I still think I have come a long way from the very Fundamental belief system and outlook I have had years ago. Maybe there is still hope ha
<br>
<br>
Its all just interesting to me and in no way meant to be authoritative nor do I expect any adherence to the answers from me or anyone else. Just a small bird singing a lovely little tune in my ear, and besides that ....its fun.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

jus thought of a couple questions and remembered the question i forgot
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
1.) see question from previous post
<br>
<br>
2.) are there other universes with other beings that live? like maybe even a parallel universe, as i heard at one point scientists were talking about how it's possible
<br>
<br>
3.) will we all reunite with family and/or loved ones when we pass away as well as friends and people we know? (like when they pass away if they haven't already)

being skeptical is probably what might keep you from getting any sign or what not

first you should try channeling someone, cause seriously channeled writing/drawing is amazing

mustardseed, if you see this and can corperate it into your next channeled convo
<br>
<br>
can you ask something along the lines of, the Prison Warders (4th dimension entities)
<br>
<br>
i'm confused, cause im getting messages from this Nibiru 12 group of people, or something
<br>
<br>
then it goes from Good To bad and tells me im gonna get abducted and shiz.. and i can't get answers anywhere and its really frusterating!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nibiru 12, Prison warders, Reptilians
<br>
<br>
<br>
some stuff like this, and the nibiru 12 seem good when talking to me, but then some aliens inturupt it seemed like, and told me im gonna get abducted in 2006
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and yes it creeps me out a bit
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i cant find help anywhere, maybe you can
<br>
<br>
who are these people communicating to me while i was remote viewing, and are they good
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
thanks if you can take any time to get any answers from that through channeling,
<br>

thank you

That gave me a good laugh!
<br>
<br>
It's true. If you were God, why wouldn't you want to make it so that instead of trying to figure out some cryptic text, people would just be able to ask You directly? Is that too easy?
<br>
<br>
I think that maybe in a fashion, it's the way things actually are. I think you can experience and get first-hand knowledge. Unless you think that's too easy and you need to spend your life expressing blind faith to someone else's interpretation of an interpretation of something someone experienced god saying or relating to them in some way. The word of God is not written, it is experienced (so to speak).

This post has probably been the most ridiculous waste of time ever created on this site. It is very unfortunate to have people with nothing more to do with their time then waste other peoples. Its not the fact that this guy creates this disgusting work of fiction and posts this, its that other people give into it and start to believe in it. This very thing is the exact backpeddling of true spiritual development. This is also a very unfortunate occurence that will always take place online and make it impossible for people who are truly interested in real metaphysical matters to find a place seriously research it. It is why i have become very detached with this site and others. I beg you people... stop and look at things like this, ask yourself truly, dig deep down and really ask, is this guy sincere? Its not hard to figure it out. Stop fueling this kind of nonsense, there are sites for this sort of thing... i was under the impression that this site was not, i guess im wrong.

I prefer to be referred to as GOD or at least God. None of this minor god spelling. Okay, first - everyone's special. Do you think psi wheels make someone more special? I might be omnipotent and all-knowing, but I thought you wanted Free Will - so I'm not the one who is going to decide how your future turns out.

Again, you're asking whether I will subvert your Free Will again. You need to get a grasp on what it is exactly you want - Free Will or predestination (you haven't become a Calvinist, have you?). If you just want to have Faith that I'll do everything for you, fine, but please realize that package deal includes a fierce Smiting as whim occurs to Me along with all the other stuff. You don't get to just loaf around. Something has to keep My interest.

 OK.....well Telos my friend lets chat, before you get all wound up and aggressive try to calm down and use your mind. I have given you a good mind and you know it....don't you. This thread is not intended to poke at you or anyone ...it really isn't .....can you believe that? Its just someones conversation with ME, that's all..... ME as he sees me and as he understands me. It is a honest display of someones emotional life and connection with his GOD. No attack on anyone not you not anyone, he just writes what I tell him. No deletions no planning no preconceived ideas. Isn't that exiting to you ? What if.......Yes....what if my friend?. Think about it .........just consider the possibility and if nothing else live and let live my friend, if this thread is really me speaking you cannot mock me stamp me out or anything and, if it is just the thoughts and mischievous ideas of a crooked individual it will sink into oblivion, in any case be careful that you are not found to mock me......GOD

RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM RANDOM
<br>
<br>
THIS IS HOW IT IS

<br>
Its all GODS PLAN all credit is due GOD! In my reality I link-up all your thoughts and comments, your all in perfect agreement.
<br>
<br>
Although I speak for myself

Hey James remembers the bread, and the vacuum above our heads.
<br>
<br>
When I play chess I don't plan anything, I just let it happen. The answer to your mathematical question is 11 Bevis.
<br>
<br>
Much respect ad love to everyone, I'm not judging anyone, this is very hard for me.
<br>
<br>
This is a confusing matter that has caught my attention. As you all know I 'think' I decode light, and I 'think' I'm wise. And an occasion like this pops up when I'm about, and after I've learnt lots of valuable lessons and made important decisions. It's just too hard to resist, I shall try ad solve this dilemma if you all give me permission.
<br>
<br>
These thoughts have caught my Random intuition many times. I say randomly because it's more as if I click on the random page number and something relative will show up.
<br>
<br>
I'll give an example this is an example that I actually believe I first decoded to be used now.
<br>
<br>
One day I was chatting to God 'In my head' and we were having a laugh, then because I'd been listening to that Mercedes Bends song, I asked God if he'd arrange a Mercedes for me (at the same time I was asking this I knew God 'searching my heart' knew I was asking him for a joke not testing or mocking him, despite what some people might think.
<br>
<br>
Anyway the next day I visited this Golden Thread, and I found myself

</a>
<br>
<br>
Funny Vacuum!
<br>
<br>
I'd like to share something with all of you, needn't I remind you all that I'm a Man of my Word. I shall now be assuming that I am aware or that I can decode God's plans, so if I'm wrong in my interpretation then I'm pretty sure I shall be utterly devoured. Everything is on the line!
<br>
<br>
Months and months ago, probably at the start of the year or before Christmas (|I've been decoding times a little hard to keep) before I had developed my understanding of light decoding or in your vocabulary MS, prophesizing I had some experiences which I think I should talk about.
<br>
<br>
Along time ago I was watching of Mice and Men on TV, then I suddenly begun decoding (watching it in a very different way) Anyway I watched the whole film, maybe because I didn't bother at school to study it properly I wrote a long essay out describing Mice and Men and how the characters relate to Mans existence in the Universe. In simpler form I decoded what Mice and Men meant to me in that moment. I wrote it all down and recorded it on Dictaphone, Just in case. I was in fear for my life.
<br>
<br>
The Pool Table
<br>
<br>
The next or same day after decoding 'of Mice and Men' I went to a Pub called the Sportsman, with three friends, Aaron, Simon and Jon. What is important is that we played Pool.
<br>
<br>
While my friends were playing I was describing the Universe, decoded by me then. I used my surroundings to describe the emotions and thoughts I was decoding I was in communion thus the pool table became my/our vehicle to explain 'thought' to my friends who would listen.
<br>
<br>
I was saying that the white ball represented the 'Player or now I think Prayer' the pool cue when handled becomes an extension of thought, when you play pool you KNOW when you've got the shot lined up, you know when you hit the ball where its going. Sometimes you'll pot the black and the white will go straight in and thus you loose, white represent you and black well you can guess the black.
<br>
<br>
I was talking to Aaron and I wasn't keeping an eye on the game but exactly as I said this Black ball was potted by Jon and the white ball slipped in, a nice coincidence yes.
<br>
<br>
Then when Bon Jovi living on a prayer came on I was overpowered by the decoding the words of the tune (Lenny and all that), and then I proceeded to explain to Simon about the universe and my work or play via its decoding. Simon told me that the book I write should be called the book of knowledge, I told him that if I did write a book (which I'm not sure if I should) it would be called Divine Truth. I then went through the same examples above but with a slight difference, instead of saying sometimes you pot the black and the white, I said sometimes you accidentally pot the black. Again almost as soon as I said this Jon potted the black, loosing in the process coincidence again!
<br>
<br>
The pool table can be viewed from many angles.
<br>
<br>
Yeah also my family friends name is David, you can see the testimony here, last time I spoke to David he told me down the phone that he gets his communication directly from god, I believe this, Now I also discussed a revelation that I was wary about with him, he told me this.
<br>
<br>
"You could swindle everybody and nobody would know any different"
<br>
<br>
This was quite startling for me. Because believed I was doing the right thing. But I wasn't totally sure if I was, which is why I phoned David to get confirmation for what I was thinking. On a previous phone call he urged me strongly not to post anything, which could be decoded to mean this situation, I don't know, I'm a risk taker.
<br>
<br>
When lots of people are prophesying it is important that somebody is there to interpret their tongues, or as I understand decode their light. I myself have nobody to decode my light I have to decode my own, which means I have to be very discerning having nobody to tell me what I think and I have to distinguish between pride, all sorts of things, without help imagine that! (Without help is just an illusion although very real)
<br>
<br>
Which is why interpreting GODs will without a light decoder/translator is a dangerous thing. People will come to the thread and they will be very honest about what they think.
<br>
But I think it is quite evident that nobody here KNOWS what's going on, nobody sees the 4D picture.
<br>
<br>
Please take everything I say with a pinch of salt, I know I do.
<br>
<br>
Hear: Bon Jovi - Living on a Prayer!
<br>
<br>
Ohhh Yes!
<br>
<br>
Decode Yourselves!
<br>
<br>
Who knows I might be about to explode!
<br>
<br>
One thing Hi GOD how's my singing/Rhyming? I don't want to cause any trouble with it, but it's something I like doing?

 Right. Well there are more than one of us.

<br>
No, no, I mean in God. You know the Catholics say that there are three.

Mustard seed? why are you chosen to speak to god and answer the questions. If we ask a question that you can not answer simply an answer similar to do not test my exsistence shall arise. I do not see the point with people trying to have fun with your (from what I see) confused mind. At that I would say to have a full understanding and knowledge of god would be to understand PIE and its concepts,numbers,theory,and to fully understand that solving the question of god would be uncapable of the human mind for the circles traveled would be endless and in understanding god would be understanding your very existence where as you could quite possibly fall out of existence because if your mind is as powerful to understand god our dimensions would not be able to hold you to this dimension. sigh....oh well

I think you misunderstand  the whole thing but I am OK with that. In my concept God is very personal, he is my God as he is yours. I talk to him.....big deal, I just have taken it a bit further than most....I actually believe he answers me. Ha He is not understanding numbers endless mysteries etc not to my understanding....he is love, and he.....loves us, jokes with us winks at us as a real good friend a mate a lover parent or whatever you relate to. Your very best friend. I still find it amusing that so many people get so miffed and upset that I talk to God and ask him about stuff......its as if they get jealous, and absolutely must prove me wrong .....some obsess over it and become very unfriendly and ......well ha anyway I am just having fun. Call me confused silly stupid or megalomaniacs I am OK with that . My suggestion would be to calm down crack a joke lighten up and enjoy the thread and the pulse and your life.

God, can you elaborate on exactly who you are a bit more? I mean we can't very well ask questions such as what is your favorite color, or what music do you listen to, so could you try to bring some of your Godliness down to human levels so we could relate to you a bit better?
<br>
<br>
No, Mustardseed, you aren't any of those things you call yourself to protect your thread from the idiots. Tapping a channel like this is a small step towards where humanity needs to be, even if you aren't truly channeling anything. Essentially I consider this a test, whether it's you seeing how people react to random Godly phrases; or maybe even some rare nurtured form of SPD. I seriously prefer to just go with it and see where this takes us.

<section>
This is Why this is Dangerous, I don't know if your talking to me MS when you say some people are jealous, I'll assume your not.
<br>
<br>
However I really need to know about my singing Mustard Seed.
<br>
<br>
And just in case I wasn't attacking you, I was speaking to GOD because he follows my trail of thought or I follow his trail, as well as everyone else's
<br>
<br>
My word our powerful I never used to rhyme, I don't want to cause tidal waves and mass destruction simply because I like to sing. Sounds silly but true, singing or rhyming is a good way for me to deal with lots of energy and emotions I don't need.
<br>
<br>
And Mustardseed I wasn't testing you, your name is David, when I woke up Intuition (UP) introduced me to David. David to me is a man, a man who is my master; anything he says he says for a reason. So I think we may have or I may have got our wires crossed!
<br>
<br>
And MS I'm not interested in proving you wrong, quite the opposite. I'm here to provide link-ups and coincidences. i'm working with you.
<br>
<br>
I know somebody called David, he is a family friend, his NDE is recorded in a book somewhere, I could probably find out which book it was, anyway. THE NEW Testiment can be found here, word of mouth usually!
<br>
<br>
Yes that does make the new testimont the old testiment.

What I find interesting and coincidental, is this
<br>
<br>
Chill Said
<br>
<br>
"Good stuff Mustardseed, building your boat engine I mean.
<br>
<br>
I've missed you, and I will private message you about something.
<br>
<br>
By the way (and I will edit this out later on) I have included you in a movie script of mine, a script for a short film that might made in the fall, if it's meant to be.
<br>
<br>
In the scene a woman speaks to a man in a restaurant by a highway and she says :
<br>
<br>
- I might have met someone who speaks directly to God. His name is David Mustardseed. You should write this down.
<br>
<br>
- Sounds familiar.
<br>
<br>
- No, not David Copperfield the magician : David Mustardseed, the God channeler.
<br>
<br>
Something like that. Actually only bits of the script have been written so far, but many, many notes have been jotted down.
<br>
<br>
How's life treating you ?
<br>
<br>
By the way, you are just a clin d'oeil in the movie. I haven't dare to steal anything from your life or your inspired words, just decided to mention you along the way. People in the audience (hypothetical audience) might think that you are a purely fictional character, or they might check you out.
<br>
<br>
Check your pm."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes that does sound familiar to me, very familiar. for the last week i've been going on about how we need a boat .
<br>
<br>
Then I have the pool table, and I can tell you something, when I was playing pool that day it was very different from any other day. And I recorded mice and men on the Dictaphone, only a light decoder would understand it but it was the best I could do for the time.
<br>
<br>
David told me that I couldn't trust anyone, including himself. Now how do I decode this situation? I'm aware of two David's either they both talk to GOD or one of you (or me) has been mislead, and then there's the chance that we all work for GOD but some of us don't know what the right hands doing from the left.
<br>
<br>
In any case, I think I see the whole picture I think I know, I can prepare a full on full proof legal case (with no training just decoded truth). I can Judge you all, but I really don't like judging people,! it makes me fear for my soul and is bad for my mental health. And people dont like being judged.
<br>
<br>
So this temptation to explain everything on this thread could be a stumbling block before me or it could be GOD saying yeah Bread you know, show them how good I've made you, and judge them all.
<br>
<br>
A complete test of my freewill

i want to know:
<br>
<br>
how here and when do i start to channel stuff ? and MS whats the point behind this whole challenign god thing ? one can if if you know about it just ask a question and then wait for the reply which ussually a sing along the way which you can understand or as in channeling audible in your head i thake it or as the direct voice thing via ear.
<br>
<br>
there can be a problem with interpretation if someone asks god for you something, in which that person can misinterpret which was ment for you as in a way you can understand... just wondering here for longtime about this link in the case with a pastor and his followers. then also the possibility of misinformation via the person who talks to and then passes the word to the person/people waiting for the message from god.
<br>
<br>
just some thoughts

<section>
Yes you are right it is certainly far from an exact science. Some people prefer it that way but it is not. There is a very surprising part of the thread that talks about that. Not only misinformation but what about people making traps for me (in this case), and who give only half information etc.
<br>
<br>
Channeling, or Prophesy as Christians call it, is very mysterious, and it appears that it is a mixture of me having the faith to ask and expect an answer to something, and you being open to express your honest questions, having the willingness to consider the answer as from God, and then naturally the God factor.
<br>
<br>
If any of these are missing the answer will more often than not, be colored. Heavy emotion can sometimes color it as well, anger resentment and the more neg related problems especially. It appears to be a bit like a remote healing of sorts, where the actual healing is a spiritual thing instead and ideas instead of physical healing is implanted in your mind making it possible for you to self heal by relating to God on a personal level.
<br>
<br>
People seem to often misunderstand this. They ask questions about lotto numbers, something I don't have the faith to ask, or they ask in a spirit of disbelief something that it seems God cannot answer. They often seem to want proof and this messes up the channel. The Bible is pretty clear it says that
<br>
<br>
"he who comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a re-warder of those who diligently seek Him"
<br>
<br>
Faith in Him draws his Spirit. Apparently anything less than a childlike faith "garbles" the signal so to speak. These are some of the things that "God" explained somewhere on the thread, and they seem like very good and plausible points to me.
<br>
<br>
In any case it seems that God is doing it this way to encourage people to talk to him in sincerity. Not so they can get lotto numbers etc but so he can pour down his love on their lives. It seems that he works like a vacuum and if people open up their spirits like that He will answer somehow, tailor made to each individual.
<br>
<br>
I am just recapping some of the thread and what the Channeling's seem to indicate. Hope it answers your questions or at least some of them.
<br>
<br>

So that means "he" is not god.

The "you need to have faith without seeking proof" doesn't make much sense to me, it sounds like what a religion wanting control masses would say.

If god existed and talked through 55 pages on a forum he wouldn't mind to answer a simple question like the one i asked.

truth, ive been speaking to my higher self as well and you must start the question with believe and trust. same as when you ask for guidance from a god. you have to believe that you will recieve an honest answer and can trust it. me for one the bible (which it making this a riligious strife topic. one shoul always respect each others take on god, religion and life) have good guide lines, but should not be taken as black on white rather seaking the truth behind the book as just reading it as rule 1 to 10 to follow.

i at first really found it odd in a way to Ask and then reviece the asnwer every time corretly and it  could have been trusted from the first time. from what i was learnt to only to ask through a person for the asnwer rather now i could take directly, but in the end i gues that the angel or god or whom ever is asnigned to guide you does so with smile and love.

<br>
You know what I am just gonna give it a shot. Normally I would ignore posts like your but you do sound quite sincere so I will try to explain what I said above without cracking jokes.
<br>
<br>
Its like this.
<br>
<br>
I fully understand that you have doubts whether I am really channeling God or something else or my own thoughts or whatever. In other words....you do not believe. That's OK of cause, however it appears that I am not able to get anything that will suffice as proof for you.....not ever because your issue is not proof but disbelief. !!!!!! think about that a bit.
<br>
<br>
Faith in something is sort of a drawing power......like faith in the force in that movie you know. The Jedis were taught but what did they teach them?.....I think that they taught them to believe that they had those powers. It seems that their powers were dormant largely due to their own disbelief in them. (I don't believe I can lift this rock=I wont try=I did not lift it)
<br>
<br>
So taking that principle to the thread if you do not believe or even just want to believe, it seems that I am not able to "get" anything for you. God as I know him is not in show business as such and it seems he hides himself from people who rely too much on their brain their reasoning or whatever you call it,  and choose to instead appear to those of childlike faith.
<br>
<br>
This may not be to your liking and possibly you will reject it, but that's OK. We all learn as we go. In any case that was what I was trying to explain. If God was very concerned with you believing in him I am sure he would be quite able to convince you, being the ultimate power....right. It seems he is just leaving mysterious little hints along the path of your life to make you think.......maybe pray and even talk to him. He is perfectly able to answer you. Someplace it talks of how god speaks.
<br>
<br>
It says:
<br>
<br>
And you shall hear a still small voice beside you saying this is the way walk in it.
<br>
<br>
God was not in the thunder or lightening but in a still small voice. The enigma of life the most power full being of all talks in a whisper, the ultimate ruler is born a poor person, and the most unlikely group of people are chosen as representatives of God, the foolish the poor and the simple. Selah
<br>
<br>
By the way Selah is Hebrew and I believe it means Think. Beth would know.

All above and Below, Self Evident! Nevertheless Interesting.
<br>
<br>
I think I'm like God, therefore in these matters I behave like God, as you all know, God can seem pretty arrogant and he has a big ego and I love him for this. If God came down in person to explain things none of you would listen to him unless he spoke to himself like this. Self-Evident!
<br>
<br>
I did try yesterday's lottery numbers! And God knows I was testing him, something I would never have done, if I hadn't of came here, freewill and all that. I talked to him like you talk to him, I added that if it be his will then it will be so, he knows my heart intentions and reasoning's better then I myself, he knows that I endure loneliness to the extreme, even if it is an illusion!
<br>
<br>
Indeed I am a Hypocrite of the highest degree I've been aware of that for along time, even communicated it here! I've had people laughing at me all my life, one of the perks with Dum speak. I've even had someone spit in my face, because they didn't agree with the way my soul communicated with me.
<br>
<br>
Until very recently (And I have Oazaki to thank for this, who I blessed BTW) (You just brought judgment upon yourself.)
<br>
<br>
I suggest you re-read this entire thread with open understanding to other events, and Gods words. I was a Dum know nothing I still am, I'm sooo simple more simple then you MS, but I decode everyone else around me so my knowledge is merely AP's decoded interpreted thoughts, thus the jealousy you see in me is the jealousy you see in yourself, think about the source of this jealousy thing!
<br>
<br>
I made a fool of myself on AP externally and in real life; I learnt a lot from this foolhardy behavior. If I hadn't then I wouldn't have the qualifications I have now.
<br>
<br>
BTW whenever I address you due to my own understanding I'm addressing the man himself, so this is how I speak to myself.
<br>
<br>
MS you're me and if you don't believe that you're judging yourself, chill your talking to yourself. MS now can you see where the silly jealously I'm talking about comes from? Not from the source that I think you believe. Maybe swaying my judgment a bit, as I've said I am but a man. i do have feelings.
<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to trick you, you know I'm not, that's alright with me, I've already judged myself and linked all these threads together in my mind (automaticly). I know how it all fits together I'm just deciding if I should manifest yet (I'm waiting for my intuition).
<br>
<br>
Like God says I write what he tells me to write no preconceived ideas I haven't studied your thread I've read it fully through once and that was just the other day, I would say these are your own decoded thoughts and judgments. For me Red and Blue are the same, I haven't even begun yet, I don't plan nothing!
<br>
<br>
So if I didn't tell you the whole story that's because I wasn't meant to then. For me its quite evident you provide Gods face, I may have the UP around me all the time but like many Dums I've never seen Gods Face, and it appear that I never will see his direct face, but many Dums will without even knowing the rareness of it and it won't even affect them as a Incarnation memory since they don't believe. Despite how these words sound I have no worries with this, it's always best to be honest.
<br>
<br>
God does know me by name, David assured of that, and he gave me my name for specific reasons, which I've already decoded.
<br>
<br>
Anyway one of the first things I said to David and God (And therefore one of the most important and revealing to my nature) was if I should take wife/companion (Brad Doesn't believe in marriage), God said I could do anything I wanted, and then he added that most people would say I was very lucky! What would you if think if God said this to you?
<br>
<br>
"You have to be very careful about the source you channel."
<br>
<br>
David, I consider Oazaki our enemy, I know my enemy like myself,  I trust him and respect his words and actions more then I do yours, and I'm pretty sure Oazaki's hold mutual respect himself, he knows how to play.
<br>
<br>
You, my friend and brother, are very confused and you don't see the full picture like me, like me you admit this yourself. I had to reveal myself to you where as light decoding on first reading your name, months and months ago assured me that you where mixed up in all this, the same as when I first caught Spectral Dragons name before reading any of his threads.
<br>
<br>
This is how I talk/sing to God!

Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
The thing is I don't believe in god, even if I did I wouldn't believe in the tradicional christian god and I don't think he could be "channeled".
<br>
If god existed he would be more like a presence than an entity, he wouldn't be something you could have a objective talk with. Once you did contact with him you would instantly acknowledge his will instead of having a normal conversation.
<br>
<br>
I once believed in the christian god (because I was raised christian), but as I left childhood behind and as I started having oobe and oobe related experiences I quickly stopped believing in the christian construct of god and adopted a more logical one. Later I stopped believing in any kind of god.
<br>
So you see, the "little hints along the path of your life to make you think" have been given to me and they didn't led me to believe in god, they did the opposite.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion I don't believe you are "channeling" god.
<br>

This was a quite long post, I apologize if my english isn't very good.

Yeah well I was doing some serious decoding, it's been very stressful.
<br>
<br>
Slipping into that Trail again...
<br>
<br>
Found out I'm only going on Holiday for four days, I think that's good sign! I watched LA story again last night on ITV 3, this time the whole film, especially the end when it says Condition Clear on the Road sign, due to the sheer shock of the experience I had while watching before, (I was Dums Struck) I missed that bit last time!
<br>
<br>
MS I'm pretty sure where being tested for our Offence and Defense, see Gideon's Trumpets Below! The New Testament Bible I received from the Gideon's when they came to my School along time ago. It was presented to me (signed and recorded) 23/11/95, Nine Years to the Day of the DUM statement, which I only found out afterwards.

Channeling God
<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone asked some cryptic questions
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 to you.....yea
</span>
<br>
<br>
what do you mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I mean cryptic to you
</span>
<br>
<br>
does that mean you know and are able to answer
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 you know that I know....the question is....are you able to receive
</span>
<br>
<br>
yea that's the problem
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 anyway you could give it a shot.........you got to grow in this
</span>
<br>
<br>
you really think so, but what if I get it wrong, it will make people doubt you, won't it?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I can take care of my own reputation.....really quaint you know....you worrying about me, anything strike you as loop sided
 <img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
 love the smileys
</span>
<br>
<br>
yea I guess so.....so the question was...let me see...I gotta to some pasting wait up..............
<br>
<br>
here it is
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Should i leave my parents alone ? Is there any way i can talk normally to my parents ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY ? I am going to do 2 things that will surely change my life ... please refer it to #1 and #2 ...
<br>
[most important question]
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. So you are saying year 2012is the end ?
<br>
<br>
so take the first one
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 no
</span>
<br>
<br>
no what
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 no don't leave them alone, stuff happens and its all for a reason, sometimes more reasons than one. The victory is however in pro active action and in doing rather than being passive, it always is.  He should judge righteous judgment, look deeper look behind the mask the mask is that part that remains frozen and cannot speak.....look at the heart and use my spirit to see if there appears to be a presence of malice or not.
</span>
<br>
<br>
no idea of what you are talking about
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 that's OK......don't worry about it
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK so is there anyway he can talk normally to his parents
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 that would entirely depend on him. What is normal anyway, two Greeks do not sound normal to two Scandinavians nor do dumb people appear to be normal, to people who have use of all their faculties. It all depends on there being a will to turn the other cheek, to take and wear the garment of humility, acknowledge differences, all things are possible with my spirit of love, even the dumb speaking but it will require some sacrifices, and some compromising and giving
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK again no idea.....continuing should he do 1 or 2
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I will not answer that, I am not in the business of making decisions for folks who can make them for themselves, I would be really very careful with deciding on the first one so...well ask him to either rephrase or make up his mind. It all depends on him, where does he want to be in 5 years
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK so you are saying 2012 is the end...?are you
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 for you all there will be no end I am with you always world without end, besides why worry about 2012 its a long way off. I can tell you something else though....the veil is getting thinner, the manifestations of the spiritual realities are increasing and the enemy of mankind is very active.
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK I will send that thanks hope its OK bye
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 bye

Ok all this letter to "God" was useless for me . And i believe if it was truly God who you talked to , he would have sent me some guidance .
<br>
<br>
In short , at the first question he all said its up to my normality vs theyre normality and to look deeper , use his spirit blabalbal . Didnt help me
<br>
<br>
At the second question the answer was the same , its up to me . Dear Mustardseed if that entity was God he would have understood from START that i was trying to understand the consequences of my actions of #1 and #2 because im not sure of them . And for God .. of course i am careful deciding ...
<br>
<br>
<br>
Can you ask ~ God ~ if hes got something to tell me ?

,
<br>
God was telling you something, but you should know that the English language isn't necessarily the best medium, especially written.
<br>
<br>
Look inside yourself for your path and follow it, because you should know yourself better than anything (and if you don't, then maybe you should). Don't be afraid of the dark places inside, because one day they're going to jump out when you least want them to. Don't be afraid of death, but don't be afraid of life either. Do what you're supposed to do and be happy, or don't and be miserable. Your choice. Just don't be afraid of yourself dammit.
<br>
<br>
He gave you a simple answer; don't leave your parents alone. A suggestion.

Dear Interesant
<br>
Sorry it did nothing for you. Instead of trying to explain why I think this did not work , look above at the previous posts.
<br>
<br>
I was thinking about it and felt the need to ask instead, if you would be interested in learning to Channel God for yourself. It stands to reason that if he speaks to me he would also speak to you.
<br>
<br>
If so I would be glad to do some hands on instruction of my way of doing it. This would require a bit of time on your part as it is part meditation and learning automatic writing. Maybe others would be interested as well.
<br>
<br>

<section>
Very well then. I will put together a few points . That might take a few days as I am in the middle of some other business.
<br>
<br>
Please take note that as any endeavor in the spiritual/astral it requires a positive can do attitude. Just as few people learn how to project if they do not believe in it, channeling has to do with a believing will.
<br>
<br>
Use these days to ready yourself, telling yourself that you are getting ready to talk to God. I have tried Channeling other people but find that even though at times it happens, for starters God is so all encompassing that it gives me more faith to hear. It is as if I say to myself that if there is a God and he is all powerful he is certainly able to talk to anyone he wants to talk to.
<br>
<br>
This is priming the pump so to speak, and I will get back to you later. Anyone else interested in this conversation?

The Purpose of This Thread's Revelation
<br>
<br>
There will be no more Delay!!!
<br>
<br>
Well I'm still alive. I am the 2nd Oazaki to appear. I've had more time to think about my judgments and the purpose of this thread. I believe the purpose is to lure the enemy out from his hiding. The Enemy has already appeared. My codeword for the enemy (and Gods Codeword) is Robert Bruce, re-read the thread.
<br>
<br>
Decode People!!!
<br>
<br>
I now trust the real Robert Bruce, so sorry about that earlier statement.
<br>
<br>
Mustard Seed and Oazaki, I know we've been lead by the spirit. Therefore in this matter you are not under the Law. I understand a lot of what's going on I was lead here by spirit just the other day.
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.linkwordlanguages.com/greek.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.linkwordlanguages.com/greek.htm
</a>
<br>
<br>
The Greek word for Water is Neroh!!!
<br>
<br>
Now As you have said Mustard Seed
<br>
<br>
"It says:
<br>
<br>
And you shall hear a still small voice beside you saying this is the way walk in it.
<br>
<br>
God was not in the thunder or lightening but in a still small voice. The enigma of life the most power full being of all talks in a whisper, the ultimate ruler is born a poor person, and the most unlikely group of people are chosen as representatives of God, the foolish the poor and the simple. Selah
<br>
<br>
By the way Selah is Hebrew and I believe it means Think. Beth would know."
<br>
<br>
Well it says the most unlikely group of people are chosen as representatives of God. In my case the most unlikely person I can think of is Oazaki.
<br>
<br>
This is interesting, I've been saying since watching the beech "Very intrestarno". Anyway on my tree of life Oazaki is a complete straight line that travels straight down the middle of the tree from top to bottom, very elegant indeed, but it could also be seen as lukewarm. I seriously don't know.
<br>
<br>
Well call me crazy but I think GOD plans very far ahead, well he doesn't I think he just does it!
<br>
<br>
This is the most Self-Evident thing ever! Water is the symbolic example of nothing. I understand a lot about nothing and I know how dangerous the practice of nothing is, attracting all sorts of problems. I've decoded a little of this, Man is Nothing i.e. Water, and when we look into water we see ourselves, reflected in nothing! Like the Abyss in the tree of life...
<br>
<br>
The numbers six can be flipped to nine. So the number 666 and the number 999 (both the same number for me) can both be flipped, for me its self evident that these numbers represent Reflection.
<br>
<br>
This makes compete sense to me, but I know some people won't understand.

<br>
<br>
6 + 6 + 6 = 18
<br>
then 1 + 8 = 9
<br>
<br>
9 &gt; is multi-talented, compassionate, and global.
<br>
as to 9 pointed star points to wisdom.
<br>
<br>
flipped 9 + 9 + 9 = 27
<br>
2 + 7 = 9.
<br>
<br>
18 + 27 = 45,  4 + 5 = 9

Trinity is, Tao which manifested by (or give rise to by) yin and yang... 1 -&gt; 2 and 3 ... 2 and 3 is the basis of any mathamatic... 1 can change any number to iether yin or yang... 1 can stand on its one unchanged ... there is tao in yin and tao in yang as its the basis of eitherthing and the manifestation of perfectly balanced yin and yang. as number is multiplied with 1 or devided it stays the same as it can iether stay neutral or influence a change from yin to yang or yang to yin.

<br>
anywhays what i wanted to comment that what i come to believe and read is that it may be wisdom that will be the undoing of 'christian faith' as it just putted 666, even to that one may not ask nor seak asnwers then its wrong and away from the pack. moreoever it possible that the broad path could be just blindly following the priest/church and not asking god personally to lead you which then points to narrow and oddly path that sure has been the case so far of really wanting and searching for the truth and nost just blindly follow rulebooks.
<br>
<br>
i would like to pop an interisting question MS
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

I would like to know... to you hear anything before you talk to this 'god' MS?
<br>
<br>
I do wish he/she would show him/herself and give some proof.. as in anwsering these 2 questions.
<br>
1) are you real?
<br>
2) anwser this problem please (as stated in the first page, although this time I am looking for the anwser to the written problem below), i am interested in the anwser because it would be very interesting to know an anwser to this math problem that has not been solved by humans before:
<br>
<br>
You have a set of 1000 numbers.
<br>
<br>
K = some number that is approximately half the sum of the set
<br>
<br>
At most 1000^10 (exponent 10) times: You may compare, add, subtract, or do anything else (that takes a short time) to a number in the set.
<br>
<br>
Find a set of numbers (from the set of 1000) that sums to exactly K.
<br>
<br>
<br>
-please anwser both questions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Aaaah yes and one more. What color of skin, as we would term it today, was Jesus?

Hey Mustardseed,
<br>
<br>
'Selah' is based upon the verb 'to raise up' 'to lift' and is sometimes used as the equivalent to 'amen' ...
<br>
<br>
'Selah' can also mean 'to weigh' or 'to balance' as in "it cannot be weighed against gold of Ophir..." (Job 28:16-19.)
<br>
<br>
BUT, the exact same word also means "to make light of" or "to toss aside"
<br>
<br>
so...we have to be especially careful with this one unless your context is really clear.  For example, if I were to sign a post:
<br>
<br>
Selah,
<br>
Beth
<br>
<br>
it would be intended to carry the first meaning, but -- I guess if I wanted to be covertly tacky, it could also be the third meaning, or in modern day emoticonism, the same as
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
.
<br>
<br>
You know me Mustardseed, enough I hope, to know that my position on these ancient languages is such that they should be appreciated in our world for what they
<i>
 were
</i>
, but not to fall into the error that these 'dead languages' can ever become what they once were--so we need to leave them in the past so to speak.  And this is most especially the case for the Semitic languages, there is just too much of a variation of meaning... and besides, both Hebrew and Greek have modern forms of their languages that, should you be interested, you could use if you so chose.  But the biblical languages cannot be used as such...
<br>
<br>
BTW:  'Neroh' is a perfect example:  this is the word for 'water' in MODERN Greek,
<i>
 not ancient, classical, or biblical Greek
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Language is wonderful, but language definately has its limits.  If God can speak, and wants to speak to an individual, God knows well what their native language is.  If God ever wanted to talk to me, it had better be in English, because even with being familiar with the biblical languages, I would probably still say "huh?" "What didya' say??"

Peace MS,

<br>
<br>
Thanks Beth interesting stuff! And I agree with that as well. Hebrew is a backwards language, and its for a reason.
<br>
<br>
God Controls all causes and effects how he does it I don't really know but it's to do with thinking and manifesting thought, despite being guided to it, my point in bringing that up now was to demonstrate that time waits for no man, and God changes everything in the blink of an eye..
<br>
<br>
Ancient Hebrew can be used to Self-Train on any language. After all language is just a unique mix of letters that make words, the Alpha-Bet
<br>
<br>
To me, Hebrew on the other hand is a symbolic language (I'm not an expert on language yet Beth I'm just learning that I love it!). I think symbolism has demonstrated itself as a form of language that links together all modes of thought.
<br>
<br>
So I always speak Hebrew even now when I'm speaking to you in English with my understanding I'm communicating telepathically via Hebrew, which you hear and see in English.
<br>
<br>
Now Hebrew letters our endowed with energy that can be tuned into or switched on. So if you draw a tree of life and then pick a language you wanted to learn, all you would have to do is learn how that country decodes there light, i.e. Via Hebrew Symbolism mixed with understanding you can  tune yourself into there tree of life and it will come more naturally. If you where in the country it would be even easier, having the foreign energy all about, if you can thought travel across the waters it would be even easier!
<br>
<br>
Does any of that make sense? Because I really hope it does.

<section>
Would that mean then that you don't respect your own potential future and all the possible success it may have in store for you, since the "future" will always be unknown and cannot show itself directly to you and to the concept of "now"? It's like you are saying that you jump to negative conclusions of things that haven't familiarized themselves to you yet.
<br>
<br>
Are you the kind of person to only show respect to people whom you know, but not to strangers whom you have never met before? Now isn't that quite a condescending attitude towards other people in general since most of the human population consists of individuals that you've never met or never will meet in a very long time.
<br>
<br>
Your view is a materialist view and because of this materialist type of attitude,  the world is suffering from religious wars. These wars are caused by the conflicting societies that are intolerant of differing beliefs and unfamiliar faiths. Intolerant societies jump to negative conclusions about things they don't understand and things that don't seem to "show themselves" in a familiar manner.
<br>
<br>
You think that this "Higher Being" or "He" or "She" or "It" or "WTF any of us wish to call it" will show his/her/itself to you in a comprehensible manner such as "proof" or "evidence" and in turn and only then that you will show mutual respect.  HOWEVER, how would you really know in which form this "higher being" will present itself to you? Haven't you even thought of the possibility that whoever this "Higher Being" is can take on forms that are purposely made to present puzzles and obstacles in your life? Haven't you heard of the notion that adversity can help an individual grow and gain inner strength?
<br>
<br>
Those are things in which every human being and life-form have in common, and that is, we all have our own obstacles that are tests in our lives. These tests are designed to strengthen our character as well as self-respect. It is only through respecting and acknowledging those unknown factors in our personal lives that help us expand our tolerance and open-mindedness towards others.
<br>
<br>
Not everything can be proven with "Scientific" data but "Scientific" data is not necessarily the form in which such a "Higher Being" chooses to show itself to you. Perhaps this "Higher Being" addresses each individual through the most personal aspects in his or her own  life since those aspects define the most serious characteristics of that person.
<br>
<br>
"What's your passion, what's your desire, your goals, your ideals, who are the most important people in your life?"....those are the questions that each individual needs to explore within themselves. Think of it as like a return to innocence so to speak whilst finding the inner person of oneself. I believe this is where the concept of a "Higher Being" communicates to us, at least conceptually speaking.
<br>
<br>
We may never know the answer, but sometimes the answer isn't what we're supposed to look for, because every answer to every person could very well be different. We all have different tastes correct? That's what makes us unique and similar at the same time. We all struggle and we all have different opinions to things, but it is in our uniqeness that makes us all special in someway. That's greatness of free will.

<br>
my personal take is:
<br>
<br>
there is something there, a higher intelection being. who ppl see differently to their understanging hence all the different religions with their gods and goddesses. its all aspects of that one being.
<br>
<br>
for me a god and goddess. i follow the path of the shaman, so i speak to gaia and my anime guide aswell. i was brought up in christian way which ive come to believe are the broad path. and the narrow path is those who really seak out god and their destiny as its not cleary written out like a FAQ ppl take the bible for and other riligious scriptures.
<br>
<br>
ive spoken to my highself and god for that matter wich was alot clearer than asking someone like a priest to relay the message as it sometimes iether get muddied up or conceited. I get a gut feeling that this is right on each question i asked and answer i got as with path i am currently following, but this could be different to someone else as they must follow their path and seak out their destiny - overcoming the obsticals set out for them.
<br>
<br>
in terms of respect and attitude it be wise to be so in manners of believes to each other. otherwise we will forever continue the cycle of war that is currently raging out there. its really silly to slay someone just because his take on life differs from yours.
<br>
<br>
why do i beleive there is a god/goddess, Kyla (animal guide) and gaia well the feeling for me comes from inside. if a take a gues my higher self which is interconnected to them as they are to me. we are all part of each other at alltimes.
<br>
<br>
i am still young and learning soul with issues too just like everyone else. in the end i gues we all just want our own space to grow and explore how we want to and not by someone's designs.
<br>
<br>
i really believe above all else that one should ALWAYS ask, ALWAYS wonder and EXPLORE everything. you can do what ever you just dont harm anyone including yourself. if we dare not to question we surly are dead puppets tagging along.
<br>
<br>
if i may venture we are technically in the darkages again. the veils are set and the masses are blindly led around by their knoses. be glad that your are reading this because your veil has holes in it or either its gone

Channeling
<br>
<br>
Before I get into too many specifics I need to explain a few things and ask for a bit of cooperation. I naturally do not expect you to unquestioningly believe that I channel God. This may be due to a few different factors. The first one is that your concept of God, may be and most likely is different from mine. This we will have to accept. I therefore remind you that I Channel MY GOD, and the discussion of whether He is the God or not will always be very subjective. In order to understand my point of view however, I will briefly explain my concept of God.
<br>
<br>
God to me is Love, the very feeling emotion or spirit of Love. The motivation of every man or woman who ever lived who moved out and committed a good loving deed. The Bible states that everyone that loves knows God and he that does not love does not know God for God is LOVE. Human love is in my opinion limited and very finite. The Love that we once in a while encounter, when we experience the deeds of individuals with a unusual amount of empathy, be they mother Teresa or Diana, or may they be yourself or your neighbor, is in my opinion inspired by God. He lives in all and loves every single person on earth as if they were the only one he had.
<br>
<br>
He is omni present everywhere at the same time, all knowing and posses all the emotions we as humans have, he can get sad happy and even angry, HOWEVER before you get all freaked out by that statement (ha knew you would balk at that ) He still remains perfect. His emotions are a level above ours and not manipulated by ego pride so forth. These I consider lower vibrations, neg infiltrations you might say, to garble Gods voice in man. These negative spirits and emotions simply does not exist for him.
<br>
<br>
He is in my experience pleased when we talk to him , and more willing to give us of his wisdom and love, than we are to receive. On this basis I channel God. I talk to him about my life daily and hear from Him about my questions and problems.
<br>
<br>
Preparations
<br>
<br>
In order to prepare I think it is imperative that one is determined to listen to the answers one is given. I do not advise one to be too literal in the implication of what one hears but a openness to hearing something that one does not naturally expect is a plus. It is a matter of opening one self up to a different way of seeing the things one goes through, and it only becomes real when you are willing to admit that you have been wrong in your attitudes and judgments oodles of times in the past.   It is like admitting to yourself that you are not without fault, and have reacted in pride and arrogance in the past and it opens your spirit and seem to elevate your vibrational level considerably. On the other hand stubbornness pride and ego seem to lower it and interference seem to occur much more frequently.
<br>
<br>
It is as if having an attitude of submission to God, even only as saying "God if you really are up there, I accept that you know best". One can say that you trick the ego to admitting its limitations, and helps greatly clearing the channel. I used to spend a couple of hours praying for others in a intercessory sort of prayer before Channeling as well. It might be some of you on the pulse my Family or someone I read about, or at times people I just briefly met and had a certain feeling about. Praying about them or for them I often use what I think is termed tactile imagining. I imagine I meet them and sit down for a meal and talk to them. I sometimes hug them and hold them or go for a walk on the shoreline of an imaginary ocean or lake. At these times I listen to them and assure them everything will turn out well in the end and try to impart healing to them, massage their bodies or whatever. This praying seem to open my channel as well.
<br>
<br>
Automatic writing
<br>
<br>
In the beginning I used to just open my mouth and speak sentences as they came to me, and then record them. I would often have long tapes to listen to especially when I was going back over specifics, and it became very cumbersome. These days I only use audible channeling when I Channel for someone at a personal session, and instead I have started the last few years to use automatic writing. Automatic writing is a bit like writing a letter but still its not. It is a gift or talent that has to be worked with and developed. In the beginning it was very hard, but it has started to flow much better. The easiest is for me to use handwriting and it is so much easier for me. I write well and have a god clear handwriting but often I get so tired of writing as the words come so fast and I cant stop, so I have started to use the computer. I do not touch type, so it is slower but its so much easier to read and go over for reference.
<br>
<br>
I have to stop here but will write again in a few days I thought of covering a few of these points
<br>
<br>
1.How do the words form and how do you hear them.
<br>
<br>
2.What interferes or colors your channel.
<br>
<br>
3.Who can channel
<br>
<br>
4. How to make personal use of Channeling
<br>
<br>
5.To interpret or not to interpret what you hear
<br>
<br>
Any specific questions are welcome, I hope this is interesting and helpful
<br>
<br>

Not saying you should believe in whomever.....Just saying, that this "Higher Being" might not necessarily come in one form or in a form in which you might expect.  Since you look for evidence in order to respect such a concept of a "Higher Being", then sometimes the answer or answers might not come as scientific data.

. We're probably more a like than you think. Because just like you, I'm also an agnostic, although I try to keep an open-mind at all times. Forgive me as well for accusing you for being part of that category that causes the majority of the conflicts in the world. I didn't intend to post my earlier point in that manner. Perhaps it was a bit harsh.

Hi Mustardseed, intersting stuff my friend.
<br>
<br>
I have one question, I am a medium and channel for people most days, clairvoyantly and mentaly. The expirience of Channeling my own higher self is very very different from any seprate entity or conciousness.
<br>
Your expireinces sound very simalir to mine, not the conversations, but of simalir nature.
<br>
Are are you are 100% certain your not channeling your higher self? Its not that I dont believe you, why shouldnt I? Why shouldnt some one channel God. But our higher selves, our soul, is our closest connection to God at any level. Regards and God bless you Marcus.

hello I have a question
<br>
<br>
this time its no test or question of power or authority
<br>
<br>
my question is: I believe that there is something out there holding things together. But could it not be the mental manifestation of billions of minds syncronizing together to create something of meaning for death? instead of just dying and wonder the planes we used something as powerful as the subconscious mind to create this "heaven". Now before any of you go on rambling about god created us all or how dare you defy him, I look at it like this
<br>
"when the rain falls and softens the ground it dries and becomes stronger"
<br>
simply put I feel you should question your beliefs regularly to strengthen your beliefs.
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed: I'm interested to read an answer.

<section>
Hi everybody
<br>
<br>
Here is a bit more, I am very busy making a living these days I apologise for the lateness.
<br>
<br>
Before you start to actually channel there are some exercises that I find helpful. RB wrote about quieting down your mind, and while that is very helpful I found myself that learning to listen to what is going on in your mind is equally as important. In a channeling I received the following advise.
<br>
<br>
Your mind is a series of rooms, connected one to the other. A class of children are having school in the first one. You are in a way in an adjoining room and with your sub-consciousness you listen to what is going on, while you go about your chores. In a way you remove yourself, or try to observe your thoughts, at a detached level, not unlike when you are phasing. You do this for 1 hour a day for one week. You can increase the time daily but it involves doing it on the go, while you are busy with other things as well, (otherwise it is actually phasing). You learn to observe or monitor your mental chatter as from a distance.
<br>
<br>
The mental picture is that whenever an argument arises in the class room or negativity in its various forms come to the fore, you take notice, and focus on whatever happened to regain peace. This is when you maybe get upset with someone negative etc, your mental chatter rises in intensity. After a while you learn to discern how your mental chatter "sounds". (I expect its different from person to person) you learn to observe circular thoughts or obsessive thought patterns, and by being able to distinguish them you are able to do something with them, replacing their negative energies with positive thoughts, maybe by singing happy songs in your mind or memorizing poetry quotes etc (I find certain key Bible verses helpful but it works with a variety of things, as long as they are positive and light)
<br>
<br>
After a certain time, maybe a couple of weeks, in observation mode and after having made a reasonable strong habit of observing you can start by asking God (or whatever you call him) simple questions of a yes or no nature. You do this by in a sense you lifting your spiritual voice over the chatter of your mind and elevate the vibration or your consciousness, really try to focus and you will then hear a clear mental answer almost as if from a imaginary 3rd room. Having heard this answer you should do what he tells you. Now this is not like should I jump this balcony, but things of a very simple nature. It can be when you are really in doubt and either decision could work. After a while you can ask for specifications but this concept is the structure you build on. After having done this for a while you need to establish a system by which you can judge whether what you hear is Gods voice or not, a discernment sequence, and we could cover this next.
<br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone wanted to chat about these things if so I would be glad to talk to any of you. I would not know how to set it up but maybe someone knows a way we could do it. If not I will just keep writing bits and pieces but seeing I am very booked up it may take a while.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

Hi Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
When God communicates with me, he will give me a sign in the way of a click, either in my sinus cavity or in my ear. One click for "yes" and silence for "no".
<br>
<br>
I have been talking with God for about 10 years now. Pretty much just yes and no questions but it has proved to be very useful and insightful.
<br>
<br>
I can't wait to talk with him in person!

hello there, i have a question to ask to god, its simple, straight to the point
<br>
<br>
"why do all the good men have to suffer and die? and why do the evil ones get away with everything?"

<section>
I have an answer to that, I not sure if God would say the same thing, but here's how I see it.
<br>
<br>
Good men suffer because of the state of this world.
<br>
<br>
Take a look around, does it seem that negative forces or positive forces are more dominant in the world today? It's hard to be a positive person in a world of negativity. Many times the good you do is taken as an insult. That's because the receiving end is in a state of fear.
<br>
<br>
But it's better to be the positive person, because then you are in a state of love instead of fear. The one who is positive might seem to suffer from time to time, but the one in a fearful state is in constant suffering.
<br>
<br>
So be "a good man" even if it seems that it doesn't pay. Because ultimately it does.
<br>
<br>
Hey mustardseed, if you talk to God, ask him/her what is this thing when religious people "find religion" or whatever is this thing called in english(God will know what I mean). What happenes to them in that instant. That question has puzzled me for a long time.
<br>
<br>
And thanks for giving instructions on the channeling, I would like to be able to hear him as clear as you do.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
<br>
-Pete

<section>
My take on that,  is it happens because it was meant to and always for a good reason.   I know it's really hard to understand that while we are in these physical bodies but it makes absolute since over there.
<br>
<br>
And my belief is everyone has already decided pretty much the lessons they are going to learn while here.   It just happens that some people agree to be victims of horrible fates, but you can rest assured there is a lesson there, if not for the actual person but the people around that person.
<br>
<br>
My opinion of course,

<section>
And to add to Nay's message:
<br>
<br>
Many times people are angry to God that why he permits evil to exist and basically why can't everybody be happy and live in a paradise.
<br>
<br>
From what I have learned that is not the whole idea of this place called physical universe. If God(and we) had wanted us to live in paradise, then we would have never left paradise. But we did.
<br>
<br>
We came here on this level of reality, because we wanted to. We took on the veil of forgetfulness because we wanted to. It's all part of this "play" and has a purpose.
<br>
<br>
We are immortal souls which cannot be harmed. Yes, we live temporarily in a psychical body which can feel pain and suffer, but that is transitory and can be a great teacher. Lessons can be learned here much faster than on some "easier" higher level. And because we are here, then it seems it's well worth it. The problem is we don't remember making the decision to come here, and can't see the benefits of this, so it seems wholly unfair and unjustified. We only see the dark side of the coin and make our judgments based on that. Well of course it seems unfair on that perspective.
<br>
<br>

<section>
Suffering is the term of human existence, there must be some in our life or we are not human. I know that what I say sounds very black-and white, but have you ever found a person who knows a life that had no hardship? I can already answer this for you: no. and there never will be. it is conceited to think of our soles as immortal, for an immortal thing does not know change, our souls are always changing, just like the world around us. There is no evil nor good, no love nor hate, these are all just part of the complex ever-changing, biological dance that the human race is puppeteered through. As we live the life we chose we must accept the knowledge that we chose it and it is what we are living through, we must also accept that were in it until the end, I don't believe in destiny, if I had, I would have never written this. My advice is this:
<i>
 Choose
</i>
your path, and never let anything else choose it for you.

I have two questions for him.
<br>
With good and evil, there really is known, it is all a matter of perception. What one thinks is good could be thought of as evil to another. So, how would you make the decision of bringing someone to heaven?
<br>
<br>
<br>
And the question.
<br>
Is the bible true?
<br>
If God wants, symbols will be tolerated. Then again I'll tolerate anything. I'll probably treat God as any individual.

This is who you know. I can't use my other user name now, only this one.
<br>
<br>
I have questions for God.
<br>
<br>
1. What with this talk of mine about me being agnostic ? (It's been lasting for months now...) I have the feeling that you are behind this, or that someone is, pulling me in that direction. Emptying my cup so to speak, starting fresh. Faith versus reality. Faith is important, but are You faith-based ? Are you for real ? I still believe that you are, but it's engrained, I am not sure how big it is still a part of me now, is it getting stronger or weaker ? Arggg...
<br>
<br>
2. What should I do with my life -- in January ? I am really unsure. Work, what kind of work, Master degree, Communication or Creative Writing, or something... else ?
<br>
<br>
3. Is there something unpleasant I should know about myself concerning what happened with Nicolas this summer. I think it's really over now : he will not contact me again, and I am pretty much "over" him now. I really liked him. Is there something that I don't know about me (my behavior, something) ?
<br>
<br>
4. Which will be more useful for me and my friends ? Learning through parnic healing or quantum touch ? Or something else ? Do you have a simplified method ? I have the feeling it is very simple. I can almost hear some answer from you here.
<br>
<br>
I am a little lost, feel lonely and have a cold.
<br>
<br>
Take your time Mustardseed. Let it flow. Don't worry if it seems off-target or vague or weird.

How do you know that you are not being deceived by some entity portraying himself as god?

We humans are very easily deceived by all are senses and intuitions.

Is it truly possible for an entity that is not God to masquerade as God?
<br>
<br>
If it is possible for anyone else other than God to answer to God's name, whenever the person addressing God has a strong and clear intention of addressing God, then even prayer is suspect.

We are all supposed to have a direct inner connection to wisdom and guidance--if we cannot trust that, then we are truly lost.

I'm not sure. I do remember Robert Monroe writing about experiences with a very powerful entity claiming to be God, and when he wouldn't worship it, it tried to harm him (this was in Ultimate Journey when Monroe was searching for his lost source).

What about all the people that kill in Gods name?

God told me to do it.

I am looking at this objectively. I do have faith, but I also don't have "Blind Faith".
<br>
<br>
Some people need to believe so badly they get caught up in dogma's of religion and in control of not so good people, even if they are good people.
<br>
<br>
If God is all knowing and loving he will not be angry with anything we ask.
<br>
<br>
If we seek God should tell all.

Channeling God
<br>
<br>
Wow God that was a big deal
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha it was fun
</span>
<br>
<br>
Maybe I should tell everyone
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You better they are wondering
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK so let me explain. In the last month I have been very busy, I am again in Europe after having spent 6 months in Asia performing and staying very busy. I am also back together with my wife from whom I have been separated for almost a year. It is a bit of a wobbly ride and our work demands a lot of us. We are starting a new routine together, and I am very desperate to learn all my lines etc so I have not had a lot of time to Channel. I do apologize to everyone. The good news is that my wife would like to help me.............she has talked to God for a long time and is a very reliable medium. What do you think God............is she?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha you are so funny.......OK then YES she is fine but I must warn you.
</span>
<br>
<br>
About what
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well she asks different questions than you do
</span>
<br>
<br>
Really
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yes she is female
</span>
<br>
<br>
Does that matter
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure it matters, the question asked has a lot to do with the answer
</span>
<br>
<br>
OK scary So then can we somehow summarize what are the most important questions......and if you don't mind please leave out the "prove you are God by giving me the lotto numbers" kind of questions as well as the " I don't believe you are channeling God if you are tell me what I am holding in my right hand"
<br>
<br>
Those kind of questions are sort of very low on my priority list. Instead open up your heart to receive have a sense of humor and spiritually be ready to receive from a slightly unconventional source
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well said
</span>
<br>
<br>
Thanks
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Does that mean you don't want to know the lottery numbers cause I was just ready with them.....lets see 23...ahh just kiddin'
</span>
<br>
<br>
Had me worried there
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha knew that have a nice evening
</span>
<br>
<br>
thanks see you later bye

Mindfreak, There are some experiences that are not for all persons to have at the same time.  If some one does not believe in God or a god or gods or any other type of supra sensual intelligence that is also an opinion.

As for theory, some would say that what I stated earlier is not a theory at all but a fact of their lives and they know perfectly well the difference between what they experience and what a fantasy is.

<br>
<br>
And some people may have different experiences that contradict yours, or perhaps they have had experiences that show them reality beyond any one god. But to clarify, I only refer to god as a supreme being that is higher than anything else in existence. Perhaps there are beings that believe they are this god and trick people into believing the same even though this god itself is not all-knowing.

Doesn't mean that God is infinite knowledge that he should talk like a physics teacher, perhaps it is better to talk in a normal way.

Well give me an example which questions were Gody that God didn't want to answer. I did not read the whole topic.

We all do channel 'god' or 'God' no matter what your opinions are.  Some things that a human can experience are not open to ALL humans.  Are there beings or persons who would impersonate a diety?  YES!!
<br>
There are also persons who would impersonate or fake knowledge and wisdom.
<br>
<br>
The still heart, the still mind, the still listener, knows the difference.
<br>
<br>
The creator who created all things also created incongruity which is the basis of all humor.

Dear Stacey
<br>
<br>
I apologize for not having replied sooner I have been out on the great Ocean cruising and have not had Internet access for some time now. I am not able to take up the thread at the moment and even if I did your questions are very confusing to me. Somewhere in the thread I explained how it works for me. It seems that "God" if we assume it is God, uses my intellect and mind for the formation of the sentences he speaks to me. Often I try to get something about a personal situation and my "channel" seems obstructed or somewhat colored by my minds knowledge or lack of knowledge of the situation. This is also the case if I ask something that is above my intellect's ability to comprehend, it sort of freaks my mind out in a sense, and I lose my "balance". A bit like Peter walking on the water and looking down and starting to sink. I get in the frame of mind that "this is just impossible" and just like when moving around in the astral, I create my own impossibilities. Hope you understand.
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

<section>
Staceyc_330,
<br>
<br>
Pardon me for butting in here, but imo, Regret is not who she says she is, and she is not who you need right now.
<br>
<br>
I have no clue if the above is just my own opinion or if a guide (or someone/something else) encouraged me to say it -- you make the call.
<br>
<br>
I would encourage you to make a practice of recalling your dreams and keeping a log of them. It is tedious and sometimes maddening. In my case, I get glimpses of what I call "meaningful" dreams, along with a whole lot of just routine dream images. However, that is where reality will come from.
<br>
<br>
By the way, if you are hearing voices, or a voice, supposedly telling you things in a non-dream setting, I would be very cautious about it.
<br>
<br>
Good luck!

<br>
This forum is meant for debate and discussion on very sensitive/serious issues related to spirituality. Posting that you disagree with the concept of channeling, or doubt about the validity of MS's channeling God as you understand it, etc are very welcome. And if you read back through the very long thread, these questions/concerns/issues have been brought up repeatedly.  But no one is in a position to definitively say that what MS has posted are lies. He sincerely believes that he is channeling God.
<br>
<br>
Catholics believe that when the Pope speaks on issues related to the bible that he is representing the word of God. Isn't that a form of channeling? Granted that's a drastic example, but the point is that many people in the world believe in the concept of channeling in one form or another.
<br>
<br>
Posting that you disagree with the concept of channeling or the content being channeled is one thing. But next time try not to belittle those who do believe in it.

Hi Mitch
<br>
<br>
I seldom want to be part of such a discussion and leave it to people themselves to make up their mind. However I want to reply to you and I hope you do not mind. I know very well that I am digging at a very basic foundation here. To some people this is the utmost of blasphemy to say that I talk to God because that would also be your God.
<br>
<br>
People seem to channel just about everything these days, aliens, composers, spirit beings angels ad libitum and no one cares. Why?........because it is not their angels spirit beings or what have you. However everyone has a claim to God in some way. I suppose this is the reason why they get offended............I claim to be channeling their God, and they cannot handle that.
<br>
<br>
I apologize if I offend you, it was never the intent.
<br>
<br>
By the way he is the one you should be upset at..........he is the one that keeps talking to me

 I have a math problem for god that has never been solved (many have tried):
 <br>
 <br>
 &lt;font color="green"&gt;You have a set of 1000 numbers.
 <br>
 <br>
 K = some number that is approximately half the sum of the set
 <br>
 <br>
 At most 1000^10 (exponent 10) times: You may compare, add, subtract, or do anything else (that takes a short time) to a number in the set.
 <br>
 <br>
 Find a set of numbers (from the set of 1000) that sums to exactly K.&lt;/font id="green"&gt;
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 (This is an approximation of the problem, but the answer will probably be valid for the more complex version if it is solved)
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
And now 3 years later I shall attempt to solve the problem:
<br>
<br>
Firstly I will downscale it to 10 numbers only (you will see that this will exactly work with 1000 numbers). My numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
<br>
K = 27.5
<br>
<br>
I take the number 8 and add .5 to it. (apperantly i am aloud to do this when I read the instructions). I add 10, 9 and 8.5 together (my new set of numbers chosen from the previous set, plus the one number I am allowed to edit). Thats also 27.5
<br>
<br>
As you see this will also work on the grand scale....
<br>
<br>
Anyways am I just not understanding the problem correctly?

Channeling God
<br>
<br>
I am back
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes I see that
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I wanted to ask you about Jeehad and Islam
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 are you sure you want to get into this?
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes....I thought a lot about asking you
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 ok what is the question then
</span>
<br>
<br>
Its not so easy......I want to ask about Islam . Are you the God of Islam
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I am God
</span>
<br>
<br>
yes I know but what about Allah and Islam, they claim you are their God alone
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 As I said I am God, not God of only some but God.....you know as in God of the Universe
</span>
<br>
<br>
But they say that Islam is the religion of the one true God
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 wait.............Thats funny ..........I just looked around and I am all alone here
 <img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
</span>
<br>
<br>
what does that mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Use your common sense Mustardseed, if I am God, the God of the universe how could I be God only for a certain people
</span>
<br>
<br>
Thats what I was wondering about............but how does it all fit together
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Its all man making these seperations, truth cannot be owned by anyone.....truth just is
</span>
<br>
<br>
so how do you see Islam
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I see it for what it is...........
</span>
<br>
<br>
so was Muhammed speaking for you
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 He was, but like all humans he got a bit mixed up in the long run
</span>
<br>
<br>
a bit.....it seems he was a very violent man
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 men are violent......you should know that by now
</span>
<br>
<br>
but he did hear from you at one time
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I speak to lots of people, some dont believe that but trust me I do. The problem comes when ego and the mind starts to add their 10 cents as you would put it
</span>
<br>
<br>
what do you mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 As I said I speak to many but some people dont want to go all the way and chose to ommit or even change what I tell them
</span>
<br>
<br>
so he changed what you said
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well he actually added to what I said ...........like all of you he had his own agenda. If you had any idea of how difficult it is to get through to some folks, makes creating the world a piece of cake
</span>
<br>
<br>
could you elaborate
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 sometimes the spirit of man is so desperate and in agony it reaches out and pulls on me, its like a vaccum, it just pulls me along and I have to talk to them, but talking to them is the easy part, making them actually believe I am the one speaking is quite another
</span>
<br>
<br>
really
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes really....the minute I have spoken man filters what he heard and adds or subtracts what his ego does not accept. The true meassure of a man is in his surrender to my voice in his heart
</span>
<br>
<br>
So Muhammed filtered your words
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 yes some of them......can you imagine me ....God.....wanting to destroy what I just created, makes no sense even to you....right
</span>
<br>
<br>
but some of it was true
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 sure some was true, like so many he started with me but was lead astray by his own desire his own understanding and his own lust
</span>
<br>
<br>
Lust.....sounds bad
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Lust is desiring what you have not been given, what you don't have......lust for power is the worst kind
</span>
<br>
<br>
and how about Jihad, fighting and killing, and by the way how about the 72 virgins
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well they are real allright, but they are not in heaven, as you know heaven
</span>
<br>
<br>
WHAT.....they are real?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 sure they are
</span>
<br>
<br>
but how is that, how could that be true
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 listen here Mustardseed you know enough to realise that the imaginations of man in his heart is real, and they are the imaginations of many hearts
</span>
<br>
<br>
yes but that sounds like ...............well its not nice, poor virgins
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 If you had any idea of what the lower levels look and feel like, not a pretty picture
</span>
<br>
<br>
so they are in the lower levels
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 well where should I put them....they would not fit in upstairs, trust me. If they were to be put there ......well it would be a mess. Its best for them, it will take some "time" but eventually thay will learn
</span>
<br>
<br>
I see so its all a progression
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Of cause it is, you worry too much
</span>
<br>
<br>
I know..... thats true, I do worry
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 no need.......remember I have the whole world.......in my hands

<section>
I very much enjoyed reading that last post Mustardseed.
<br>
<br>
Just a little personal background here...
<br>
in recent times I've been putting in a lot of time and effort to reestablish my connection to God - God Source, Source of All, or more appropriately - God Self - that part of God that is part of all of us.
<br>
Through past life regressions I found the lifetime where I very first lost that connection to God, to All, and so in the lives I've lived since I've experienced "less than"  - separation from God. Now I'm working to rectify that, move away from operating in ego and maintain connection and surrender to God Self. Not the easiest thing, a great many old habits and programs to overcome, but definitely achievable.
<br>
<br>
So back to your post and why I said all that...
<br>
What you wrote there, your conversation with God, really struck a chord with me. I think you did a very good job of surrendering, listening and objectively writing down what you heard. And I for one believe you received a good it of Divine wisdom there.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "...talking to them is the easy part, making them actually believe I am the one speaking is quite another."
</i>
<br>
How true that is. If only more people could understand that what you are doing - speaking directly with God, is something that we are all inherently capable of doing... if we can only allow ourselves to stop thinking that we are separated from God.

<section>
got some questions that are on my mind i can't help but try and ask.
<br>
<br>
what i'm wondering is this the first and most powerful God to ever exist ?
<br>
<br>
does God question his/her own existence ?
<br>
<br>
why should God exist ?
<br>
<br>
at the same time i do understand that he always just was... i still want to hear a response...
<br>
<br>
and yes there is life, humans, planets, etc, etc, because there is a God but why does there have to be a God ? and yes i know were here as humans to live and learn, and grow. and got that because of God. and am very very grateful for that.
<br>
<br>
maybe its possible there could have been absolutely nothing. no consciousness. but no, instead there's a consciousness. an energy. a loving energy.
<br>
<br>
if i dont get answers thats ok. but i want to hear from God himself about this. i want to hear from God's perspective. even if it seems well beyond the capacity of my little mind...
<br>
<br>
i ask because i'm very interested.

<section>
Mustardseed, I too was impressed with the type of objectivity you used in your question/answer session. I would be quite curious about the responses you would get if you gave those same questions to God, but regarding your beliefs/interpretations of what he tells you.
<br>
<br>
In other words, God explained to you about how interpretation works through this type of channeling, and that Jeehad "added some stuff" as you wrote. But what about you? According to God, did you add/subtract or alter in any way information he tried to relay to you that you posted on this forum (whether this link or Jeehad's links)?
<br>
<br>
I think learning how other people change/interpret things is extremely beneficial. But I think learning how we interpret (or misinterpret as the case may be) is even more important for each individual.
<br>
<br>
Just a thought!

This is all well and good, but i would like you to explain one thing to me. What process do you use, if any, to varify the validity of the information you get? how do you know its not a spirit claiming to be god? after all even the best of us get it wrong sometimes. "god" did say humans tend to hear what they want to hear.

yea.............you are right, how do I know. I guess I do not know...............really.............I believe. I never claimed that my channeling is without fault, actually "God" covered this at great lenght somewhere in the thread. If you are looking to this as some sort of ultimate truth I will have to disappoint you.
<br>
<br>
As far as the process...........I don't really have a process I think, should I have one?
<br>
<br>
I think I am much like the little girl of 5 years, who said that she talked to God every night saying her prayers and that he talked back to her. She was asked, by an atheist, rather pompous fellow actually, how she knew it was God talking to her, and not the Devil. She answered
<br>
<br>
"Well when it tells me to do something bad I know its the Devil and when it tells me to do something good its God"
<br>
<br>
Rather childlike but still food for thought................

 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;as I said....fire away&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;someone asked a question&lt;/font id="red"&gt;

 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;I know...it was Beavis&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;wow...you knew..... ofcourse&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;yeah....I was waiting for you to find out&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;well what is the answer then&lt;/font id="red"&gt;

 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;I am&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;

 &lt;font color="red"&gt;I...I was expecting a number&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;I know , but you did not get a number...neither did he&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;but he asked for a number, the answer to an equation&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;no he did not&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;I saw it with my own eyes&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;you think you did&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;no I really did&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;you saw your computer screen and what he typed.  &lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;well that was his question&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;nope&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;well ok can you explain&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;he was asking me to prove myself, asking for a sign. But there shall be no sign given him.
 <br>
 He was asking.....are you real....and I answered.....I AM&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;Ohhhhh I see. sort of trying to trick you&lt;/font id="red"&gt;

 &lt;font color="red"&gt;wasn't that mean&lt;/font id="red"&gt;

 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;not really, he is ok. Tell Beavis that sometimes the answers people expect are not always the answers they get. This is an important point&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;ok but just for the fun of it....how about answering him anyway. It would be interesting&lt;/font id="red"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;you are also doubting, right son&lt;/font id="blue"&gt;
 <br>
 &lt;font color="red"&gt;well........just a bit&lt;/font id="red"&gt;

Hi there
<br>
<br>
I am already having a conversation with him and surprisingly he never mentioned anything about that at all
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
As far as referring to copyright, and finding my own style or whatever, for your information I never heard about  Niele Walsh till long after this thread had been started, and I have certainly not copied anything from any book.
<br>
<br>
I do not expect you to believe that, seeing you have already judged me with your previous statement, but to tell you the truth my friend ..............I am really not very interested in wether you believe that or not. I just chat with God the way I always have and always will. You should try it

Haven't people talked to God this way for years?  Maybe not written it down, but at least interacting with God was just like a two-way conversation?
<br>
<br>
You are kidding me that Walsch has copywritten the
<i>
 technique he uses to talk to God
</i>
?  That's rather like me saying, "When I'm worshipping God I put my arms in the air in praise of his glory - and no-one else can do this because I've copywritten it.  You must find your own way of praising God."
<br>
<br>
If Walsch has copywritten the technique, then he's a lot further away from God than at first thought.

This is the copyright from Neal's book The New Revelations: A Conversation With God.
<br>
<br>
Of course Neal can copyright anything he WRITES or he determines is his INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  I have not found any part of this book that has the exact words used yet by MS and there is nothing I can do, but Neal has written probably more than 20 books using the same technique.  Now, it is put into the hands of the publisher of his books as to what you can do with the information in the book, but MS WROTE IT DOWN.  Here is the copyright:

So it's not the technique as such (which was what you were originally purporting it to be), but copying directly from his book.  Well that's fair enough.  I'm sure if Mustardseed did copy and paste, he would acknowledge this - he usually does when quoting from others.

If you care to read through every one of Mustardseed's conversations with God and cross-reference it with Walsch's books, then go ahead.  Do you work for Walsch or something?

I am not a judge and I know that MS writings are original, Neal Walsch does not know the people in this thread unless MS is Neal.  But, you have to know copyright laws.  A publishing company that is going broke and needing money can have employees that just scan books and the internet looking for any way to get that money and copyright laws are big business and they can bring millions of dollars in legal fees and such.  I have found two things so far that could be considered copies.  See, it's not hard to do if you talk to God.  Now, MS it does not matter that you didn't know Neal or never heard of him.  It makes no difference whatsoever.  You notice how popular this thread got after you started doing that.  There are questions even in this thread having to do with the stealing of energy.  Copyright laws are based on the Word of God.  God will not share his glory with anyone.  When God gives glory to somebody, he will not give the same glory to somebody else.  See, MS is not discussing Neal's books so he cannot use the intellect that was established by Neal and use it until 70 years after Neal Walsch is dead; that's the law.
<br>
<br>
I guess I got off on that kick because I like Neal Walsch and his ideas.  And I noticed people were saying that MS was not really channeling God; well, he's not.  He's channeling Neal.

you say it does not matter if i never heard of him, well let me tell you ............it does. This wholeidea is so utterly ludicrous, how can something God said ever be copyrighted. If it is The intellectual property of Niele then it was his idea, and not from God in the first place, when did he actually publish his conversations cause I have been doing this a long time.

I thought the only similarities was that it was written in a dialog format, like a script. That format isn't copyrighted. Just like you can't sue someone because they write in a narrative prose. The words are original, they weren't stolen (as far as I can tell). I hope the day doesn't come when you can't say a prayer because of "copyright".

Dear Alan
<br>
I have noticed your posts different places and you seem quite sure of your own beliefsystem, and meassure others by their relation to your own faith. This is not a very wise way of reasoning.
<br>
<br>
I am sure that the first native americans or whatever also said, a animal the size of a wigwam with two tails and huge blankets for ears.....what nonsense.
<br>
<br>
The very fact that God is omnipresent or seem to be rather would make the best argument for him also being personal.
<br>
<br>
Just a point of view

Hi Alan,
<br>
<br>
I too have read many of your posts, especially on Bruce Moen's forum.  You must surely see that there are many perspectives on on "God".  Can you really be the only one of billions over the centuries who has it completely right?
<br>
<br>
In my faith tradition we use the word "grace" to suggest that God loves us and is working to "save us" despite our human imperfections, and that he calls us to pass on unconditional love and grace to others no matter who they are as a sign of his love and acceptance.  That means that even though I may disagree with some of what you say, I will not be dismissive of you by calling your belief system "nonsense".
<br>
<br>
Does grace fit into your system?  Or what?  I'm just wondering where you are coming from.
<br>
<br>
Blessings, DH

I stick by what I said about channeling God, If you know your bible not even Jesus the son of God did this. Yes prayer is the way to communicate with God and the bible is how he speaks back to us, not by some telepathic voice. God only once spoke to Jesus in an audible voice when he was being baptised by John the baptist God said "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased"
<br>
<br>
On this delicate subject can we dialogue by personal message?

<section>
So Alan if you are an elder, what do you think about Bible prophesy, and what makes you think that God stopped speaking to people..............does that makes sense.
<br>
<br>
How do you explain this verse:
<br>
<br>
Act 2:17  And it shall come to pass in the LAST DAYS saith God. I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams.
<br>
<br>
What is prophesy but a conversation with God.
<br>
<br>
A few more questions, why does it matter if DH is a born again Christian, should he not "inhabit" these forum in that case.
<br>
<br>
You seem somewhat stagnated and certainly does not come across an elder, but instead your statements seem quite disrespectful and stagnated.
<br>
<br>
What makes you believe that Jesus never heard Gods voice in what you call "telepathic" ways. You have no ground for such a claim. Not that I think myself a Jesus, be it far from it, but your statement is not correct, nor can it be proved in any way at all.
<br>
<br>
For my sake you can think what you like but I do find you a bit hypocritical and stuck in a beliefsystem where you have given yourself the "right" to state what is nonsense and what is not.
<br>
<br>
Take that around the block with you next time you  go for a round.

 God by the way is the most anti-Anti-religious being in existence and views all this screaming nonsense and people wailing in long cloaks by just nodding his head and smiling.

 <br>
 <br>
 Now you seem to believe you are an expert of some sort on biblical matters. I have read the bible completely though a number of times have you. I can quote long verses from it , verbatum for all good it does me.
 <br>
 <br>
 Now a lover of God does not come over in the unpleasant judgmental way yo did, it is even hurtful and most ungodly. Look first at your own righteousness before pointing fingers at a person you know absolutely nothing about
 <br>
 <br>
 As I said on another thread I did not regIster on this forum to trade insults, but to make friends . If you indicate you would like to be a friend I would welcome that, but if you direct any more unpleasant comments at me I will not revisit this section of the forum again. You should  wake up the atheists on the other sections are much much more loving and dynamic than you are. Mydral who does not believe in God is a much nicer person than you, think about this. Your words should resonate and reflect the master you serve.Once you have said unkind judgemental things they become decaing bread on the poluted  rivers of human thought. You are not dealing with some idiot when you confront me instead of dialogueing lovingly like the Lord you claim to serve did. How is your daily walk in life? Think about this fact the One whoes will you do is your real master.

Dear Alan
<br>
<br>
I will try to answer your questions in point fashion, and your many statements the same way.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Mustard seed you are a really big mustard seed that seems to be able to sum me up although you know absolutely nothing about me.
</span>
<br>
<br>
When did I "sum you up" ? I merely made some statements about how you come across, rather judgmental and sure of yourself. Your statement was that Channeling God was nonsense, and I responded. Besides that why do you say I am a really  big Mustardseed? I dont quite understand, is it irony or ....what? Pls explain
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 What did I express that was unkind to DH I will believe what i like and despise exclusivity if that is any consolidation to you.
</span>
<br>
<br>
I did not say you were unkind, but disrespectful, and questioned the following statement,
<br>
<br>
"I would like to ask if you are a born again Christian why do you inhabit these forums?"
<br>
<br>
My question was: why would you put inhabit in quotation marks and what does his faith have to do with where he posts, something I find completely unimportant. Tell me why you would ask that question.
<br>
<br>
What you believe is your own decision, but it was not me attacking you and saying your beliefs were nonsense, it was the other way around. (I think the word is consolation, by the way)
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I am ant-religioun I have been disillusioned by these money grabbing shouting TV manics
</span>
.
<br>
<br>
And what exactly does that have to do with anything discussed in this thread. ?
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 God by the way is the most anti-Anti-religious being in existence and views all this screaming nonsense and people wailing in long cloaks by just nodding his head and smiling. I am not a prophet, there is one point I would like to say about so- called latter day prophets that they are indeed consistent about yes absolutely consistently wrong every time, every time.
</span>
<br>
<br>
And I ask again what does that statement have to do with me.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Now you seem to believe you are an expert of some sort on biblical matters. I have read the bible completely though a number of times have you. I can quote long verses from it , verbatum for all good it does me.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Again I ask what does that have to do with the thread. This is not a competition in who has read the Bible the most. I would say that statements like "an expert of some sort" is rather hostile, and a bit on the demeaning side. Common courtesy would be in order, but yes I know the Bible better than most, and studied it in Hebrew and Greek for a number of years, not that it matter much. I merely asked your opinion on a verse.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Now a lover of God does not come over in the unpleasant judgmental way yo did, it is even hurtful and most ungodly. Look first at your own righteousness before pointing fingers at a person you know absolutely nothing about
</span>
<br>
<br>
I think you are a bit too sensitive Alan, but maybe others would be better at explaining this to you. If you were hurt it was not intended, yet you yourself seem quite rash with your pen and makes many bold statements.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 As I said on another thread I did not regIster on this forum to trade insults, but to make friends . If you indicate you would like to be a friend I would welcome that, but if you direct any more unpleasant comments at me I will not revisit this section of the forum again.
</span>
<br>
<br>
I see no insults on my part but a few remarks made in earnest, questioning your opinions and wether you visit here or not really makes no special difference to me. I would like to be friendly to you but it is a 2 way street Alan.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You should  wake up the atheists on the other sections are much much more loving and dynamic than you are. Mydral who does not believe in God is a much nicer person than you, think about this.

</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Honestly my friend I think you take things a tad too personal, loosen up, it will serve you better in the long run.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Prophesy is not a conversation with God, but God using a very special person as his mouthpeace for a very short time
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well here seem to be the core of the matter, what is Prophesy. In Hebrew the word for Prophesy is Na-ba and means "to speak (or sing ) with inspiration, for prediction or discourse. In Greek the word is translated from "propheteuo" it means to foretell or to speak under inspiration.
<br>
<br>
As you know the old testament was written in Hebrew and the New in Greek.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Is the above nice and Godlike or loving like Jesus? NO NO NO
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I did not think it was meanspirited or abusive not even unkind, but instead critical of your opinion. I disagree with you, thats all. I guess you feel diffrently......I think you are a bit sensitive.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 And lastly but absolutely not least don't ever equate yourself or any other person with the Divinity of Jesus Gods only son, yes he had a unique relationship with the father, no one else ever came close. This idea that we can buddy buddy with the Infinite is as laughable as it is ridiculous
</span>
<br>
<br>
Firstly Alan I did not compare myself or my prophesy or Channeling with Jesus, YOU did. You said "I stick by what I said about channeling God, If you know your bible not even Jesus the son of God did this"
<br>
<br>
Since you made the comparison, I merely tried to follow your line of reasoning. In a discussion forum this sort of exchange is called a "double bind", if I do not answer your statement, your opinion stands, yet if I answer it you accuse myself of comparing myself to Jesus. Catch 22.
<br>
<br>
You may call me Laughable, ridiculous.....I think not. My best argument is that Jesus was bust certainly both buddy buddy and very close to his disciples so why not I see no contradiction in the Bible that this has changed after the New Testament was written. I simply think you adhere to a sort of Old testament view of an impersonal Gd, one far removed from man. This was the very reason Jesus came to the earth to make God available to all, children adults old and young. Your view seem rather religious, while I favor the more personal God......and weather you like it or not, whether you think it is laughable or not, I will keep talking to him.......would that be alright with you, or do you get offended by that as well
<br>
<br>
Kind regards Mustardseed
<br>
<br>
PS you yourself have made a few discourses and seem to have had some information given to you. You seem to think that you are privy to some information from somewhere......maybe even a divine source I dont know. Consider the following observation.
<br>
<br>
Africans who beat drums to expel bad spirits are held in contempt by Americans who blow their horns to break up traffic jams. Pretty funny. Now don't go taking this personal....its just funny

Hi Alan,
<br>
<br>
One of the things I've noticed about "elders" over the years is that they have certain opinions about truth, but they aim to draw people to the truth with unconditional love -- acceptance -- and respectful conversation (check out Jesus with people like Zachaeus, the woman at the well, the woman caught in adultery, and the various outcasts like Matthew and other tax collectors and outcasts).  It was love and acceptance that "reeled them in" and then they were willing to change.  I have read the Bible several times too, and the only people Jesus blasted were the self-righteous religious people who were condemning everyone else and neglecting justice, mercy and love (such as in Matthew 23, 25)
<br>
<br>
I do not feel that kind of love and acceptance in your posts.  You have pretty much judged Musterseed and me, and others (athiests?) with whom you disagree.
<br>
<br>
Am I born again?  That phrase has been defined in many ways in the last 2,000 years.  I am unsure of what you mean by it.  Do you think that your understanding of it negates the thousands (millions?) of differing understandings about it that have come down the pike over the centuries?
<br>
<br>
I guess I am more baffled by your statement: "DH dear when in Rome approach the Romans on their territory slowly rope them into the truth. I would like to ask if you are a born again Christian why do you inhabit these forums?"
<br>
<br>
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
In your universe, isn't "inhabiting these forums" slowly approaching "the Romans on their territory"?  What are you doing here if it's not?
<br>
<br>
How do you know that God has not called some of the rest of us to do what we are doing by being on there forums, and who are you to judge our callings?
<br>
<br>
I respect your opinion, my friend, but I can't figure out exactly where you are coming from.
<br>
<br>
Blessings, DH

What I meant was that when Paul went to Athens he spoke in a way they could resonate with. Namely he talked to them about their own unknown god, who he tried to get over the point that this unseen God was the source of everything. He did not blast their beliefs, then anyway by stating there their incorrect  belief in many gods
<br>
<br>
This forum i acknowledge which i have not gone back to read all the posts is one of two thing either there is an enormous interest in it or it is simply going nowhere with people just posting and posting to get their points across

 DH,
 <br>
 <br>
 What I meant was that when Paul went to Athens he spoke in a way they could resonate with. Namely he talked to them about their own unknown god, who he tried to get over the point that this unseen God was the source of everything. He did not blast their beliefs, then anyway by stating there their incorrect  belief in many gods
 <br>
 <br>
 This forum i acknowledge which i have not gone back to read all the posts is one of two thing either there is an enormous interest in it or it is simply going nowhere with people just posting and posting to get their points across

Hi Alan
<br>
Your post is very strange, I dont even understand the last sentence. Maybe you are not a native english speaker. I think you are confused on other things as well. What you referred to about Romans has nothing to do with Paul in Athens. It refers to a saying from in medieval Latin:
<br>
<br>
si fueris Romae, Romano vivito more; si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi: "if you are in Rome, live in the Roman way; if you are elsewhere, live as they do there" (attributed to St Ambrose).
<br>
<br>
<br>
The story about Paul and Athenians is another thing. However is this what YOU are doing here. Are your posts made only to lead us the way you really think, and do you think the people are pagans. It sure sounds like it.
<br>
<br>
It does make sense that you would see yourself as a new Paul, an elder etc. My oh my. By the way you lost a bit of the surprise element when you stated your plan and then failed to lead us to the truth on top of it.
<br>
<br>
I really have no idea what you are talking about with the last sentence, seem incoherent, to say the least.
<br>
<br>
You have not answered any of my post. Why is that?
<br>
<br>
Are you just posting to get your point across.?

Again this is a double bind. It was you who seemed to indicate that being Pagan was not right, and used Paus as a example of roping them in. You make some very confused posts. First you indicate that you are here to Rope people in, then you defend being Pagan. I have no preference, to me people are people.

You have a very confrontational way about you, and your use of slights and sarcasm seem very counterproductive to any serious conversation. "defender" of the faith, "out of the woods" indicate that I am on a crusade and hiding in the woods. Go figure.

Mustardseed,,
<br>
<br>
One thing I know you are not channeling God, like Neale Donald Walche from whom you gotthis crazy idea you are just channling your own imagination. You are creating God in your own image. In the beginning Mystardseed said to Neale Donald Walche  Let us create God in our own image.  np•   Mustardseed and others,
<br>
•
<br>
•   Now what Bevias was trying to get over was God able to give u a program wereby we would be able to separate truth from lies about himself. If you are really channeling God, where does my eldest duaghter stay:"? That is easy for God to tell you.
<br>
•
<br>
•   Your are delving in a dangeruos area and I know others have told you so. If you do somehow get into the unimaginably infinite mind of God you will go psychotic and join all the other mentally ill people that think god is talking to them or is their buddy and yes some even think they are God.
<br>
•
<br>
•   Back up man before it is too late.
<br>
<br>
To simplify Bevias was going into the domain of nfininite progression or regression to find out from God which is the best tool man  could use to separate truth from a lie about himself. God could have joined the form and posted the answer in the forum , but alas no one would have understood.. Of course he could not have used you wihout turning you into a robot by possessing you compelely and using your body to input the answer.?
<br>
<br>
But the tast given was very unfair and went into the realm of unimaginably complex mathematic and superstring theory and quantum computing, that only a few of the best brains are only vaguely beginning to undertand
<br>
<br>
I am puzzled however given that God is your personal buddy why he did not help poor Bevian out through you

Over and out
<br>
<br>
<br>
•
<br>
•   Approximation: Instead of searching for an optimal solution, search for an "almost" optimal one.
<br>
<br>
•   Randomization: Use randomness to get a faster average running time, and allow the algorithm to fail with some small probability.
<br>
<br>
•   Restriction: By restricting the structure of the input (e.g., to planar graphs), faster algorithms are usually possible.
<br>
<br>
•   Parameterization: Often there are fast algorithms if certain parameters of the input are fixed.
<br>
<br>
•   Heuristic: An algorithm that works "reasonably well" on many cases, but for which there is no proof that it is both always fast and always produces a good result. Metaheuristic approaches are often used.

Abstract
<br>
The complexity class PP consists of all decision problems solvable by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines. It is well known that PP is a highly intractable complexity class and that PP-complete problems are in all likelihood harder than NP-complete problems.
<br>
<br>
We investigate the existence of phase transitions for a family of PP-complete Boolean satisfiability problems under the fixed clauses-to-variables ratio model. A typical member of this family is the decision problem # 3SAT( 2n/2): given a 3CNF-formula, is it satisfied by at least the square-root of the total number of possible truth assignments? We provide evidence to the effect that there is a critical ratio r3,2 at which the asymptotic probability of # 3SAT( 2n/2) undergoes a phase transition from 1 to 0.
<br>
<br>
We obtain upper and lower bounds for r3,2 by showing that 0.9227 r3,2 2.595. We also carry out a set of experiments on random instances of # 3SAT( 2n/2) using a natural modification of the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) procedure. Our experimental results suggest that r3,2≈2.5. Moreover, the average number of recursive calls of this modified DPLL procedure reaches a peak around 2.5 as well.

<br>
This I understand however. You are puzzeled......because you cannot understand what I am doing, and it bothers you greatly, so much so that you are going to great lenghts to disprove me. The reason is simple. If I talk to God that means anyone could talk to God. Yup that is just about the gist of it. Anyone can........if they want to.
<br>
<br>
To you God is a mathematical infinite being who you can ask complex questions, but to me he is a friend I can chat with. Has it ever crossed your mind that God is not interested in being proven to be God. ?
<br>
<br>
You are puzzeled why.......why does that bother you so much, does it have anything to do with YOUR view of what God ought to be like.

 MS Your God is one hello politician he just does not answer anything but just goes off on a tangent
 <br>
 <br>
 Are you blind deaf dumb or worse I think you must rush off and get psychiatric help
 <br>
 <br>
 I will concede this Beavis thread that was taken over by you has generated enormous interest but sadly man god simply did not answer even question he just ducked and dived.
 <br>
 <br>
 Especially poor Beavis!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 <br>
 <br>
 Alan
 <br>
 <br>
 READ READ READ AND YOU WILL "SEE" I AM SPOT ON ABOUT YOU
 <br>
 <br>
 Beavis asked God in vain
 <br>
 <br>
 I have a math problem for god that has never been solved (many have tried):
 <br>
 <br>
 You have a set of 1000 numbers.
 <br>
 <br>
 K = some number that is approximately half the sum of the set
 <br>
 <br>
 At most 1000^10 (exponent 10) times: You may compare, add, subtract, or do anything else (that takes a short time) to a number in the set.
 <br>
 <br>
 Find a set of numbers (from the set of 1000) that sums to exactly K.
 <br>
 <br>
 And now my question:
 <br>
 Dear God, if you exist or not is not something I have an opinion on, but currently, entertaining the idea that you do, I'd like to know sometihing rather important to me. You see, I'm lost and need to know wich direction I should go. So I ask you; which way is the horizon
 <br>
 <br>
 Beavis restated his question
 <br>
 <br>
 He was asking.....are you real....and I answered.....I AM instead of saying these 2 reasons.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Ceriel N If one of the 1000 numbers is infinite then an exact answer cn not be given. Is there a range of valid values for the 1k numbers, or are they arbitrarily chosen? And they are scalar, right? how bout this, if this is truly god, please ask him to tell me what is my name?  No, not my nickname on this site, whats my real name that was given to me at birth.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you can tell me something as simple as that, I'll believe you
 <br>
 <br>
 Mustardseed, its not that "god" answered in a way I didnt like. "God" answered incorrectly. "God" said I asked if he existed, but I was instead trying to determine his intelligence
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Just read MSs new post.
 <br>
 First I suspected, now I know. - Please either verify the source or cease and desist the
 <br>
 <br>
 Charade
 <br>
 <br>
 . Mustardseed,
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Night hark posted bravo for him
 <br>
 First off I'd like to thank Al Gore for installing Internet access in middle schools across the states so Mustardseed could bring us these revolutions.
 <br>
 <br>
 Please have a permanent Out-of-Body experience. I could have a more meaningful conversation with a plant, albeit not a legal plant but none the less.
 <br>
 <br>
 The only thing you are accomplishing is wasting space on the Astral Pulse server. Also you may be confusing younger or more gullable readers. However, more sensible readers will realize that you are a joke, like your posts
 <br>
 <br>
 A few screws short of a hardware store.
 <br>
 The antenna doesn't pick up all the channels.
 <br>
 Would argue with a signpost.
 <br>
 <br>
 YAAAA!!
 <br>
 hahahaha! okay, before I start my questions for God.  I have to point out some particular things.  First: MustardSeed, thank you for curtiously helping me on my God/church/gift Thread.  And another thing which is strange lol, this time when you channeled 'God':
 <br>
 (Channeling God)
 <br>
 <br>
 After listened to MS further on I realized he is a sick person in one way or another. [xx(] Unless, he truely is channeling God. But that seems highly unlikely.
 <br>
 <br>
 Okee. Enough. I'm done
 <br>
 <br>
 MS man the GREAT MATHEMATICIAN DOESN'T DO MATHS. THE UNIVERSE WOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT HIS MATHEMATICAL MIND
 <br>
 <br>
 3) How come your not on Television like Larry King Live or something? instead of internet? lol you know larry king got james van praagh super famous, and you know noone believes in mediums
 <br>
 <br>
 Posts like this are the reason I rarely come to this site anymore.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 have doubts that an omnipotent being would decide to start a conversation to seemingly say "Yep, I'm God, but don't distrust that I am God, because I will not answer you truthfully to prove otherwise... just to prove I am in fact confident that I'm God."
 <br>
 <br>
 Hey God, thanks for your answers about John Gardner.
 <br>
 <br>
 Did your post so you flopped out of highschool MS?
 <br>
 <br>
 Mustardseed/Brian,
 <br>
 <br>
 Please stop with the drugs, mother and I really care for you! I hate to see you throw your life away like this. We have supported you in the past but doing this to these good people is just wrong! Think about your kids. my question for God :
 <br>
 why do you call Mustardseed Mustardseed
 <br>
 Yeah okay now I KNOW your not talking to God
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 quote:
 <br>
 <br>
 and remember I love Him too and ....its not that bad he is just trying to be funny
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 I AM trying to be "bad", I'm not trying to be funny. I'm trying to debunk you even more so than you already are. Point proven. Peace.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 My last complaint:
 <br>
 <br>
 If you're just sitting down and writing, then perhaps it is your subconcious/higher self, but I think it's pretty arrogant and irresponsible to claim to be in direction communication with your 'God'
 <br>
 <br>
 have to take the "credit" for that. In the channeling I merely listen to a voice and write down what I hear in audio. Any spelling mistakes grammar problems etc is due to my inferiour spelling abilities and the fact I am not a native english speaker. This is one point in Channeling that has suprised me often. It seems that "God" (lets assume it is God
 <br>
 <br>
 So you are not sure but want us to  swallow this nonsense from you own mind
 <br>
 Fear is based on uncertainty. You write that "this channeling *could* result in some rather unpleasant postings." So it seems that you're making a decision based on fear, not love!
 <br>
 <br>
 If you really are channeling God, don't you think it would be a hugely wasted opportunity if you shut him down because of a few PMs from strangers?
 <br>
 <br>
 yes, without me you are made to selfdestruct, and that is bad. So God designs us to self destruct then he is the author of death?

 <br>
 <br>
 Answer my question God damn it, what does God neeeeeeeed with a starship
 <br>
 <br>
 If this is really God, ask the following. Lets match your answer with my answer  I wanna see if your bs.
 <br>
 <br>
 1. God, You are who you are in the absence of that which you are not. So WHO ARE YOU?
 <br>
 <br>
 2. What command does the universe ONLY follow?
 <br>
 <br>
 2. Does satan exist?
 <br>
 <br>
 3. Is it possible to die?
 <br>
 <br>
 4. Does hell exist?
 <br>
 <br>
 5. What is the soul clothed with?
 <br>
 <br>
 6. Is everything perfect?
 <br>
 <br>
 7. Have you E-V-E-R made a mistake?
 <br>
 <br>
 8. Does Good and Evil EXIST?
 <br>
 <br>
 9. Does sin exist?
 <br>
 <br>
 10. Is there external judgement and or damnation? NO ANSWER NO ANSWER
 <br>
 Thats ridiculous, you claimed you didn't even know what you wrote to me in the channeled response.  Thats a complete contradiction of what you are saying now.  There would be no way for you to drive me somewhere in a cab if you didn't know the destination, to use your example.
 <br>
 <br>
 It wasn't a trap, but it definitely didn't give you the entire picture.
 <br>
 <br>
 If I was to trick you and lead you to believe that I was a female then I could see how the information might be channeled incorrectly because of the medium, but your personal opinion and first impression of me shouldn't change God's response to me.  All your examples of how channeling works is obvious and extraneous.  I am versed in how channeling take place.  The channel's opinion should not interfere with the response, if it does then you are not channeling but unconsciously giving your opinion
 <br>
 <br>
 Mustardseed,
 <br>
 <br>
 I notice you give a lot of evasive answers. You have not answered me,and it is likely because this being you call God cannot answer.
 <br>
 <br>
 This pattern this entity and yourself are creating is very much like a pattern of a negative. It will only answer questions it thinks it can answer,and yet it ignores questions it knows it cannot answer
 <br>
 <br>
 Dear Rhinegirl
 <br>
 If you insist on your agression I will have to ignore you. As far as straight talk I do not need god to help me on this one
 <br>
 <br>
 MS SAID
 <br>
 You asked for my honesty and I will give you that. "Ahh!! So sometimes you are not honest"
 <br>
 God?
 <br>
 <br>
 Stop talking to yourself.
 <br>
 <br>
 Alright...
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 But, didn't you just...?
 <br>
 <br>
 Nah uh uh.
 <br>
 <br>
 Okay
 <br>
 This post has probably been the most ridiculous waste of time ever created on this site. It is very unfortunate to have people with nothing more to do with their time then waste other peoples. Its not the fact that this guy creates this disgusting work of fiction and posts this, its that other people give into it and start to believe in it. This very thing is the exact backpeddling of true spiritual development

Its going to take me a bit of time to get through your post but for your information, I started the thread not Beavis, at the time the server broke down and the moderators had to copy the posts and relaunch the thread. It has been a while....you only have 48 pages, the original thread had well over 80 if I remember right. Beavis came into an existing conversation, and what you think is the initial question that started the thread is some 30 pages into the original thread. What do you say to that Alan..........ask the moderators if you do not believe me. It was the fastest growing thread on the AP for almost 2 years. Until I stopped posting....then it died, naturally.
<br>
<br>
PS Just read your post......man oh man you are angry huh. I have nothing to add actually except ......eat your heart out dude, you  are the epitome of a religious fanatic, intent on stamping out anyone with a view different than yours, besides that you are aggressive sarcastic, unkind and obnoxious...........yet you get all "hurt" when people answer you in like manner, a frail little wallflower it seems, yet quite poisonous. Once you have decided you don't like someone you attack them with a vengeance......and it consumes you....cause you think you know what you are talking about.

as some others said, trying to dialogue with you is like trying to dialogue with a lamppost. after 80+++ pages, you still don't get the picture??
<br>
<br>
Ok go ahead and write a book no write ten books about what "god" I supposed to be telling you
<br>
<br>
Why not join up with Neal Donald Walsh you make a good pair with your ""god"" .do a world tour telling the desperate them exactly "what they are not asking" "god".  Maybe this would not be a such good idea as ""god"" ducks and dives and avoids giving direct answers like the amazing politician ""god"" is
<br>
<br>
Do the world tour without him there might be much more dollars that way
<br>
<br>
Again, your ""god"" is your own imagination "ARE YOU READING THIS MAN!!" DONT YOU EVER STOP AND THINK  "THINK" "THAT GOD IS TRYING TO GET THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL, VIA THE FORM THAT HE IS NOT TALKING TO YOU"
<br>
<br>
You said I am angry no absolutely not!! I find the whole thing very very funny and I give it to you  , you and ""god"" and the posts you received from some people are hilariously funny I am having a great time trying to reason with a "lamppost".
<br>
<br>
Nice post great fun hats off to "god"
<br>

MS,

Speak to your buddy who is decidedly not God the Almighty but the little finite "god"
<br>
<br>
Of your imagination or have, you not stopped and contemplated that the Deceiver might be manipulating you?

I am amused; laughing at this funny hilarious nonsense does this sound like anger?
<br>
<br>
OH!! A really really funny thing said to you during your many many conversations is
<br>
<br>
God supposedly said in one of your posts that "I don't do ""MATHS""" Now I know this "god" is a colossal "LIAR"

  God  The Supreme intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is what the forum was waiting for!!
  <br>
  <br>
  With great need, humans want to have their spirit united with a supreme intelligence. This  requires a knowledge of a supreme wisdom relating to earth and a knowledge of the human spirit. With this knowledge developed and understood over generations, humanity has chosen to turn away from the earth which is in a constant state of creation where an infinite supreme intelligence is ever speaking to the spirit of all humanity. This order and harmony that humans can perceive in the natural world is attributed to a divine providence that orders and controls the entire universe intelligently and rationally. These essential elements of finite things reveal a supreme intelligence but in an exalted degree and in a manner that can not be comprehended by a human in its entirety.
  <br>
  <br>
  This supreme intelligence is conceived of as having constructed the universe in such a way that humans have in their possession all that is within the compass of their own character or moral choice and nothing else. The capacity that a human has for understanding, accepting and embracing this state of affairs is in the nature of perfect unity, invisible and incorporeal, transcending all things material.
  <br>
  <br>
  The question that really 'matters' is whether humans do have a basis, sufficient in reason (whether speculative or practical) for attributing a final purpose to the supreme cause acting in terms of purposes.  Since a supreme intelligence creates all things with its own purpose, then a human cannot perceive anything without seeing a supreme intelligence in those things.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Human words are not to be used without meaning. In understanding humanity and in accordance to the human way of thinking and in consequence with human principles, it should follow that humans are only a system of floating ideas, without any substance to support them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consciousness is the reality of the human universe. Therefore humans are causalities of their conscious beliefs and fears. Whatever a human believes they become and what ever a human fears they manifest.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the human principle of sufficient reason, there must be as much reality (formally or eminently) in the cause of any idea as (objectively) in the idea itself. Therefore, the idea humans have of infinite perfection originated from a supreme intelligence with infinite formal perfection. It follows that the idea could not have originated in a human. The origin of the idea could only be the real existence of a supreme universal intelligence. One could even expand on this logic and conclude that the mind of each human is literally a fragment (apospasma) of a supreme universal intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humans have an idea of that which has infinite perfection. There must be a first mover, unmoved. A first cause in the chain of causes. An absolutely necessary intelligence. An absolute perfect wisdom. A rational designer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conclusion:
  <br>
  <br>
  Humans are naturally desirous of immortality and therefore examine with some care how far their natural light being or spirit may lead them in respect to a shared immortality with a supreme intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The best way to know the will of this supreme intelligence would be through the express declaration and revelation rendered by the sole light of nature on earth and the sole light of nature on other planets which is perfectly founded and confirmed on facts. This happy agreement between nature and the revealed light of a supreme intelligence is equally honorable to both humans and aliens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transcending space and time to form the "essence of essences" and "idea of ideas" one must conclude;
  <br>
  <br>
  To those who believe in a supreme intelligence, no proof is necessary. To those who do not believe, no proof is possible.
  <br>
  <br>

This looks just as "channeled" as anything Musterseed has done.  Are you just paraphrasing what you think God says, or is this God speaking directly through you?  If you think it is, why should anyone believe you over Musterseed or Neil Walsch or any one of a million other people?

Don't go off on a tangent and pontificate from your own imagination, take each question below and answer "EACH OF THEM"  and I will become your humble disciple even it you do not want me as one! IT SHOULD BE REALLY EASY CONSIDERING YOU ARE A PERSONAL BUDDY WITH THE "entity" you call "god"

Dear Alan
<br>
I have posted here on the AP for a long time. I have talked to many different types of people from all sorts of cultures, and given the odd disagreement and pointed discussion, it has been all in all a pleasant experience.
<br>
<br>
My biggest problem has been with fundamentalist Muslims, who see it as their duty to convert others to their point of view, and I have on occasions had some rather heated arguments with those.
<br>
<br>
In all those years I have never posted to someone like you. I find your ways incredibly immature and obnoxious, and it appears that you have a total disregard for the feelings and beliefs of others, those you deem "led astray". You have taken it upon yourself to judge others and in this case me, because my beliefs differ from yours. You do not calmly reason your point of view but use all sorts of low blows, name calling and insinuation and sarcasm. It is very unpleasant to be the focus of your religious bias and constant abuse, while you whine like a little boy if others answer you back.  and you feel "hurt".
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
<br>
I did find it amusing to begin with but it is getting too tedious. You elegantly skip questions and arguments put to you, yet you ask many yourself in a tone of contempt.
<br>
<br>
What kind of person are you, I wonder. What kind of friends do you have. Are you just as opinionated in real life, if so you are heading for social solitude, if you have not already arrived there.
<br>
<br>
I will leave you to your own devises, and simply refuse to be talked down to by a person as pompous and "holier than thou" as you.
<img alt="8-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
<br>
<br>
I know that you will see it as another GREAT debating victory, another proof of your tremendous insight and intellect, and that you will insist on the last word and barrage of insults
<img alt=":-D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/grin.png" title="Grin"/>
be my guest.
<br>
<br>
About me pontificating ...............words fail me.
<br>
<br>
So there you go Alan, you who consider yourself somewhat of an elder, hows that.
<br>
<br>
I will do the channeling, and I will be very interested, not for your sake but my own and any who could be reading this. Have done none for a long time but I will make an exception in your case.
<br>
<br>

 You see me as an unpleasant fellow but you are wrong, you doubt the truth of your own so call god channeling, you even asked god it you could burn in hell. The deceiver is very very clever, after God the most intelligent mighty being in existence, he can emanate love say all the nice right things, get you to get a bloated oppinion of your own IMPORTANCE,to blow up your 'EGO" How do you know for sure this is NOT the Deceiver using you to Channel truths mixed with lies??. One drop of cyanide in a bottle of fruit juice will kill you. If you go to the logic problems I posed to the forum in the chat section you will see how one lie amongst many many truths will always cancel out the truth and change the truth into a lie.

Hey, he said he's going to do it. I'd wait to see what he has to say before posting again.

To be honest, the only time Mustardseed threads get heated is when the religious fundamentalists/fanatics find it. And he's been posting here longer than anyone else that's still around.

 Hmmm

Oh yes but that was not what I meant
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That's what you said
</span>
<br>
<br>
Do you want the answer
<br>
<br>
You know God.....I do but listen here, Alan is specific and wants an answer to his questions so how about we let my issues rest and get on with his questions
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Oh dear.....are you "bullying" me
</span>
<br>
<br>
No ......but it seems so important and I really wants to ask you and find out your answers.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So much so that you want to push your way through
</span>
<br>
<br>
I guess so
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Remind you of anybody
</span>
<br>
<br>
No....who
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Come on David how long have we been having these conversations
</span>
<br>
<br>
For a while
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So.....lets focus here.....think about it
</span>
<br>
<br>
If you are trying to imply that I am like him I am not buying it
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha I knew you would get the point
</span>
<br>
<br>
I don't agree
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well let me explain the point to you.....real clear
</span>
<br>
<br>
I would rather do his questions
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Lets do the questions at the end .....lets do the most important first
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well are his questions not the most important
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 No YOU are
</span>
<br>
<br>
What do you mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 This conversation was never for the benefit of the others, it was for you. That you chose to do it publicly was your own doing......you know free will and all that jazz. My main reason for answering was you.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Because I love you and care for you more than you would ever know
</span>
<br>
<br>
Thankyou, I love you too
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I know
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You see David life has a way of changing simple truths into complex problems, and it is my job to keep you simple and learn to focus
</span>
<br>
<br>
Can you explain
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure. When life gets complicated and ego and the mind seeks to take over, it is essential that you learn to stay close to me, my spirit, to focus on love compassion and reality. The world in not reality, it is a constant malmstrom that always seeks to quench the love I put in your heart. It constantly tries to make you change and turn away from the path, the straight and narrow path that I want to lead you on. It does so by making you believe lies, and then act out these lies.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Lies like what
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well lets see ...............there are so many. In your case you feel hurt because you have been unjustly accused. Your ego has been hurt your self esteem has been deflated and instead of just admitting that you cover it in a fit of fury. I notice you have that attitude when you talk to people that are very dogmatic and have a very set belief.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes that's true that irks me
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Interesting isn't it
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well if anyone has a very set beliefsystem it is YOU
</span>
<br>
<br>
That's not true..........i am very open
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha......yea right, like you were open to shams Usama and now Alan. You were so open that you continually called him Osama just to get on his nerve. YOU are not that open and to tell the truth.....I am good at that.......you are not all that nice either......you are just more clever with words and more skilled at hurting your "opponent" making it sound like it was not intended. You are a hypoctrite.....but I still love you
</span>
<br>
<br>
But ...........It was not like that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 It was exactly like that......you got upset and you knew just what to say to get back at those guys. Not a very good sample my friend. Ever wonder why people smite you
</span>
.
<br>
<br>
Well that's just a popularity competition
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Maybe but if you had been nicer you would have had better results
</span>
<br>
<br>
What do you mean
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well I mean that these people were trapped they were going the wrong way, they were not here by accident you know
</span>
<br>
<br>
Did you make them post
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 What do you think
</span>
<br>
<br>
I guess you did
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Of cause I did but you were no big help in making them change their direction, actually you just made things worse
</span>
<br>
<br>
Did I really
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes.....but I love you
</span>
<br>
<br>
Sorry
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Its ok but you need to work on that. Calm down and stop being so confrontational......yes and I know so don't start with me I know how you get upset by people who mistreat others.
</span>
<br>
<br>
I do
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That is ok but you know it is for certain that people will do that, you can do nothing about it, the only thing you can do is be my love to the people. Do you think I would have talked to them that way.....can you imagine me setting little word traps and getting all vindictive
</span>
<br>
<br>
No..................I know you would not do that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 What would I do
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I guess you would tell them the truth as simple and lovingly as you could and then if they would not listen you would repeat it
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 And then
</span>
<br>
<br>
After a while you would stop talking to them
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ahhhh so you HAVE learned a few things
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes I think so
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 People like Alan are searching David, they are searching and they are struggling to understand, that is a good thing
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well what if they get all nasty
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Lets not go there again.......you get nasty yourself........... get over
</span>
it
<br>
<br>
Ok
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 They are struggling they are seeking and they will find....eventually
</span>
<br>
<br>
Are you sure
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure I am sure........He that seeks will find and to him that knocks a door will be opened, but they have to first of all come face to face with themselves and that can take a while
</span>
<br>
<br>
Can you explain that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ego is a funny thing David, it is part you and yet not, it is an enigma to you, that the same thing that brings you such joy in the battle, brings you such glory in accomplishment and such pleasure in success, is also your biggest enemy. It takes you further and further away from me and closer to yourself, so much so that after a life spent in its company YOU become the center of the universe, and not me.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Alan has a very sweet side to him that you do not see
</span>
<br>
<br>
But you do
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Naturally I love him as much as I love you
</span>
<br>
<br>
How does that work
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 A sweet mystery of life ....love, I love you all as if you were the only one on earth, and long to be as personal with everybody as I am with you.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes I understand that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 It is hard for some people to see me that way. They cannot because they are wrapped up in their......ego, their own understanding, and a man all wrapped up in himself makes a very small bundle
</span>
<br>
<br>
Did Alan get a glimse of you
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 He did
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well his idea is so different from mine let me see what he said....
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 I am the encompasser and enfold all things within the substance of my being. Resonating with profound unfathomable vibrations, creation trembles at the passing of my presence.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am the stalker of the soul, the defeater of death. I am supreme and take the abstract, and convert it into concrete matter.
 <br>
 <br>
 I dwell in the breath of my life, which is composite bright light, looking with delight upon the beauty of the garden of my creation, sparkling out of the darkness of infinite universes.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am well pleased with my endeavours and set the clock of time to run for eternity.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am the winder of the watch of creation. 'I Am" HE,
 <br>
 <br>
 If you do only one thing repect me the "LORD"
</span>
<br>
<br>
Its so ....pompous
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha.....I kind of like it
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well how about all the other things....let me see
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Don't even bother David
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why not..............I want to understand
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Why does it get to you so much...........he has just seen a different part of me...........a bit more majestic, ..............I kinda like that
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well to me you are more like my best buddy
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I AM your best buddy
</span>
<br>
<br>
But how can you be both
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well.............I am God
</span>
<br>
<br>
So you are different things to different people
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Sure did you not know that
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well how about the militant Muslims
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That's where I draw the line, no killing is needed to please me, all I need is your love and I will give you what I have......MY love, a love that will make you love your enemies do good to thise that hate you and pray for those that spitefully use you.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yea you said that before
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 And I meant it........remember if you look for the worst in people you will find...................but if you look for the best in people you will find that too
</span>
.
<br>
<br>
Something good in everyone I see..........its like that song by Abba
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yea I tried to get my name in there but they decided differently.....you know free will and all that Jazz.....but it came out fine anyway....I love that song. Sad about the girl.
</span>
<br>
<br>
What Girl
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That's another story
</span>
<br>
<br>
Huh
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Are you getting the picture
</span>
<br>
<br>
I don't know...........its a lot to take in, I thought you were going to get quite pointed and straight with Alan
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You HOPED I would defend you and MAKE him believe you, and that you talk to me and that I answer.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yes...............I guess that's about it, I feel real silly about this, would rather not post it.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That's your choice David, what do you have to loose
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well he is probably gonna jump on me as a pound of lead
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 And
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well it wont be pleasant, he will bet all abusive and write in caps again, I feel like he is shouting at me and I get mad
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 So...been there, did that, just got a bloody t-shirt
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I guess I will have to post it.....we had an agreement
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Exactly I am glad you remembered
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ok what about his questions
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Shoot
</span>
<br>
<br>
Lets see .....I will clip and paste
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ok
</span>
<br>
<br>
Here goes
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 What is Truth..
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I am truth, I am also the way and the life, but I am most definitely TRUTH
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Is there a Devil.??
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (1) Where does God live..?? (On a throne??)
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 On a throne if you prefer to think of it that way. The heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool. More metaphysically I live in you through you and around you, I am the universe, the beginning and the end the alpha and the omega.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (2) Why does an Omnipotent Omniscient, Omnipresent God allow evil and suffering?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 I allow it so that YOU will learn Alan, that life without ME is futile, a waste, I allow it so that you will understand that unless you choose LOVE you will go astray. I allow it so that you will choose me through your free will. Cause if there were no suffering there would be no wrong choices, and consequently no right ones............but there is. Choose ME
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (3) Why do we exist.?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You exist to learn and grow in your understanding of ME I have a great plan for each of you, and you will find yours in due time.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (4) What happens after we die?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 That all depends on.........Life on earth has a way of echoing in your future, it is a school if you will a path a ladder how you progress on earth determines the level you enter in the hereafter. It is you test, your exam and after you have done your best here we will have a chat and go through the test together and see how you scored.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (5) Why does God hide himself from us?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Dear Alan I do not hide myself, look around you, I am everywhere, a smile on the face of a baby, a sunset, a blade of grass touched by the early dew, and the enthralled look on your lovers face after you gave her a good f.... (can I say that here)
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well.....I don't think so lets just put some periods
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (6) Where is the soul of Hitler...?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 In the hereafter......he is having so intensive courses....might take a while still. There are a few of those, actually he is doing better than Stalin and PolPot and a few others. It will be OK though. I will eventually draw all men unto myself and reconcile the universe.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 (7) Is there a hell where we burn in torment forever and ever..?
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 No Alan there is not. Some souls feel like they are burning and as if it will last forever, but it will only last for an Aeon, eventually they will allow themselves to be released.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Point by point now::   1) THEN  2) THEN 3) "IF THIS IS NOT TO DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND"
</span>
<br>
<br>
I don't get that.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well that is where you and I are limited. If you do not understand the question, I cannot answer it, we are bound together........I explained that earlier
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well it seems like some code that he wants you to answer so he can see if you are real
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Tell him to ask me himself,
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 You might be surprised that God "also loves me" "just as he loves you" and puts up with nonsense from both of us.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, unlike you and the Pope I do not claim infallibly. man !!! the Pope would be worried if he were to hear about you. He thought he was the only one ALLOWED to communicating with god.
 <br>
 <br>
 OH IMPORTANT VERY VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION YOU JUST AVOIDED TO ANSWER? ? DONT BACK OUT NOW!!!
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 WHY DID YOU NOT ASK "god" WHY HE LIED SAYNG EXACTELY THIS "I don't do maths, man"!! "what unspeakable nonsense", it is "YOU" that cant do maths, not God
 <br>
 <br>
 Here is the last one why don't you do math
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Now that's funny.................
</span>
<br>
<br>
Why
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Let me say it to himself
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ok go ahead
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Alan............I don't do math...............I am MATH, I am the precision of the universe, the accuracy and timing of processes so clearly seen all over, the balance in nature and order and balance of all things found in this your earth. I do not do math, as a cheap trick to convince you of my existence, I do not need to prove myself to you with a sleight of hand, for surely If you have chosen not to believe, you will find another problem for me to solve. Peoplke chose to believe in me or choose to disbelieve. If you do not believe in me as David describes me.....thats ok, but leave him be. He is like a child and talks to me as a child, it is his choice......unless you become like a little child you cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven.........Do you have a problem with that? Touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm.....in word or deed. In other words Alan..............play nice, and if you want to talk to me yourself all you have to do is ASK, and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things that you know not off, I meant it when I said I LOVE YOU as if you were the only soul on earth.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Wow
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You like that
</span>
<br>
<br>
Very ............interesting, well I will post it now.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK
</span>
<br>
<br>
So I will talk to you later
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yea do that......It has been too long.......I really liked our little chats
</span>
<br>
<br>
Yea maybe I should start again
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Its up to you......as you know......Free will and all that Jazz
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ha thanks Bye
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Bye
</span>

<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 David,
 <br>
 <br>
 I read you latest post carefully and::
 <br>
 <br>
 This is more like it each question tackled,,  and off course "God Incarnate" does not have to bend to the level of "my stupid nonsense",
 <br>
 <br>
 I am sorry forgive me your friend Alan!!!!!!!!!.
 <br>
 <br>
 keep up the good work I know now who you are talking to, he is "Divine" and was standing before Pilot when Pilot asked him the question What is Truth?. "THRUTH" stood silent before Pilot and he did not recognise him. Life is a process of learning and we are a work in process so to speak. I was about to leave the forum but you takled each question and asked in the way they were posed. Sometimes you have to be bold , that is not the Devil you are speaking to and your souls is safe for all eternity.
 <br>
 <br>
 Read Psalm 91
 <br>
 <br>
 The maths answer was also spot on God is Maths he does not have to calculate like us puny mortals , or use a computer and he just thinks and knows the answer .
 <br>
 <br>
 Please I retract all my previous hurtful comments, I know this is too late to do this as a word once spoken good or bad is out there doing harm or good.
 <br>
 <br>
 I need a good spiritual spanking and God has brought me down more than a peg or two
 <br>
 <br>
 My writings are just my perception from my finite reality what God the Infinite is all about. Maybe God did influence them in some way and hopefully they contain some truths
 <br>
 <br>
 Love
 <br>
 <br>
 Alan

<section>
Wow- this is profound.
<br>
<br>
I have seen this same story countless times:
<br>
<br>
There is a discussion between a set of around 7 people, and then two people take an issue to bear, and begin arguing relentlessly, eventually lobbing insults; each will claim they don't take the other's comments seriously, but clearly they feel the need to retaliate..... you can see how seriously they take it indeed, as eventually there are posts in sets of 8, only 20 minutes apart.
<br>
<br>
It always ends with someone losing interest, and the other taking shallow triumph.....
<br>
<br>
I have never seen it end in sincere apology-
<i>
 I am impressed with you both; it is about time we start to treat each other as our visions of God would ask us to.

Dear Alan
<br>
I owe you an apology for getting so defensive and aggressive, and hope to be forgiven as I naturally forgive you. It was very humbling having to post this, as I had expected something quite different. Thanks for not rubbing my nose in it. We all have so much to learn. Thanks for posting
<br>
<br>
Your friend David
<br>
<br>
PS.

Stillwater. Thanks for the kind words, it sure is not my credit, but Alans for having the right attitude. (come to think about it maybe the credit goes to God for getting through to us ha) I misjudged Alan. I would actually have been ok with continuing the argument and enjoy the "the shallow victory",
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
I am learning a lot these days, about my own unimportance and lack of love towards others. Hopefully I will grow in this area.

 Stillwater and David,
 <br>
 <br>
 Stillwater thank you for the nice comment to both of us.
 <br>
 <br>
 David Forgiveness is the greatest act one can do It was really brought home to me an insomniac last night, I slept like a baby.
 <br>
 <br>
 <span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
  The name David means "Beloved of God" and why shouldn't God talk to his beloved?
 </span>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 The things I said relating to you being delusional remain inexcusable, your posts were always lucid and made sense unlike the rambling of a mentally deranged person. I am ashamed by this more than you can know. Perhaps God allowed me to say these stupid to things to you just to bring to mind what onside person I can be at times.
 <br>
 <br>
 I think what set me alight, without stopping the think before I acted, was the term for the thread "Channeling God" I would have preferred "Dialoguing with God" or perhaps just "Speaking with God"
 <br>
 <br>
 Love
 <br>
 <br>
 Alan

I was just surprised that you were still posting on this thread (5 or so years now). I've never seen someone do something similar. And I also was suprised at how much of an angry little ant I was.
<br>
<br>
But I wasn't being sarcastic, I seriously don't know what to think of you. Should I be impressed that you have such dedication? Or should I be concerned that it's more than dedication, perhaps an obsession.
<br>
<br>
It's not my business either way, so I shouldn't have brought it up -- I was doing something equivalent to thinking out loud.

What is the best way for me to overcome these obstacles in my life and staying balance so I may fulfill my purpose in this great life?

Hm? I recently decided to read this on a whim....
<img alt=":-D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/grin.png" title="Grin"/>
<br>
<br>
I have a few questions...
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
1)  How come I can't get a response from you god?  Am I not trying hard enough or not in the right way?  Please tell me how to improve on getting your response.  I would love to hear you voice and be able to talk to you whenever...
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
2)  Am I accurately describing my own personality, or am I overanalyzing it, like I often do things?
<br>
<br>
3)  As you know, my family says I'm obsessed with finding myself...Is this really true?!  I don't understand this somehow...
<br>
<br>
4)  Why can't I astral project!  This is really frustrating...grrr...
<br>
<br>
Thank you god, and mustardseed lol...

<section>
There is a message in the thread from a Girl, I think she is called ....let me see.....Camigurl........... Interesting name by the way.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Yes I know, ha, ...I still think its funny to say that. I know.........
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well why can't she hear from you
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Who says she can't
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well she does
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Read it again Mustardseed
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ok One sec...........1)  How come I can't get a response from you god?  Am I not trying hard enough or not in the right way?  Please tell me how to improve on getting your response.  I would love to hear you voice and be able to talk to you whenever... :)Here it is
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 See I told you
</span>
<br>
<br>
Told me what it is me who is right, she says she can't get a response from you.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 that is correct, but asked why said she could not HEAR from me. There is a difference. A response is like talking on a two way radio and hearing from me is like opening the radio, and I am always broadcasting. Her issue is that she wants a specific answer, and is not able to decipher what she hears to get it, she need to do some more and closer listening.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Can you explain that,  it sounds confusing to me
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 OK think of it this way. If you are lost you stop at a crowded office and ask for the way and 20 people answer you at the same time, how do you know where to go
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I guess I don't
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Exactly. You see she has to learn what my voice sounds like before she can distinguish it from all the other voices in her head as well as her own thoughts. That is the trick it ain't complicated but just takes some fine tuning.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well how does she actually do that
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 How did you do it?
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ummm I don't really know actually. I think I talked a lot to you without expecting an answer, just like I would talk to a friend and pour out my heart when I was sad or happy. Then gradually it seemed that I had more and more a idea of what a best friend would say in a given situation.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 anything else
</span>
<br>
<br>
Well I read the Bible a lot as well as positive and uplifting books, I made a clear decision to stay away from writings that were either Violent or had a dark feel to them. I sort of chose the good loving stuff we could say pure stuff.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Right, you chose the good and reject the evil, that's a good beginning, and she can do the same. Everyone can. Have a spring cleaning in a spiritual way and decide to think on positive loving joyful things, to live in a loving way and be thankful no matter what I bring along the way, then gradually they will tune out the voices of the world and my voice will become clear and distinct
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ok I guess that is the answer to the first question, here is number 2. She sounds like a Libra discussing things with herself
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Am I accurately describing my own personality, or am I overanalyzing it, like I often do things
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ha good one. My dear one. You are not one personality, your personality is not static not permanent. It changes as you grow and all you can do is asses it at various times in your life, but yes you do tend to over analyze things but that is ok. It shows you are thinking about things and not just wandering aimlessly through life, I like that about you
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 3)  As you know, my family says I'm obsessed with finding myself...Is this really true?!  I don't understand this somehow...
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 It is very simple my sweet gurl, your family is not obsessed with finding anything, they think they KNOW, again it is my spirit prodding you to find the reason for it all, finding yourself is not as important as accepting yourself, the moment you accept yourself you have also found yourself.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 4)   Why can't I astral project!  This is really frustrating...grrr...
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Time time time, all in good time, looking into the everlasting in to the land of the living, the truly alive is not something that is given to all. There is a time period of testing training but relax and just do your best to live life the best way you know how and in due time.........
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: red;">
 Thankyou God
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 You are most welcome. By the way black in not a color, it is the absence of color you might say, and it does not match your spirit, just a hint.........
</span>
<br>
<br>
What was that all about
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Well nothing I just don't care too much for black, no biggie
</span>
<br>
<br>
Ok whatever, thanks for the help. Talk to you later
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: blue;">
 Ok my boy ..........cya

Thank you so much for your reply god!

It was very helpful, and I really enjoyed reading your response.
<br>
<br>
Mustardseed, you said that think of what your best friend would say when you spoke about your problems, are you not hearing an actual voice inside you?  Just wondering, I would like to know how to distinguish god's voice from all of the others.
<br>
<br>
And, I have a few more questions for god.
<img alt=":-D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/grin.png" title="Grin"/>
<br>
<br>
1)  What do I have to do to gain a better relationship with my mother?  She doesn't respect me at all, and I think she severly undermines me.
<br>
<br>
2)  I have a fear of getting older.  Am I being silly?  Getting older seems so daunting, especially when you have to leave the things you LIKE.
<br>
<br>
3)  Do you think you could aid me in a lucid dream?
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Once again thank you god, especially for the fortunate life you've given me.

<br>
Well, I've been speaking about the reality you know. Some of us can do Psi, telepathy, vision and etc. If that person can really talk or just say telepathically communicate with God then he/she must be of something beyond a normal human being. And then his/her God can give me a right answer for me to awe or believe his/her God. We're not talkin here about childish imagination. I'm talkin about the reality.
<br>
<br>
Well, I don't expect him/her to translate it to his/her God. I truly test if that is the REAL GOD of his/her!
<br>
I've been waiting for his/her answer.
<br>
<br>
And share each others ability, if one can do!
