Namaste to all,
<br>
Hello travelers. I was looking on Goggle for a new desk top image and by way of a picture wound up here. Since Spirit Web closed down I have been wandering looking for a more International spiritual chat room. Seems this is the nearest forum to that objective. Anyone that knows of a good chat room please let me know.
<br>
<br>
Those that remember me please feel free to say Hi since the divorce the wife got the computer and all the addresses that were saved in the final days of Spirit Web.
<br>
<br>
I try to visit the group at Rainbow Crystal Mountain Chat perhaps some are there by a different nick.
<br>
Peace, Love and Light,
<br>

Hi one-of-four,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!

While we're a forum and not a chat room perhaps you'll try participating in some of the discussions. You may find this to be a fun way of trading ideas and information.
<br>
