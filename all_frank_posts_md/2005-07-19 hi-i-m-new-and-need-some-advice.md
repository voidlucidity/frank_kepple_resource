 Hi, I have only astral projected accidentally, but I can't do it willingly.  When I lay on my back, I get to the point where I NEED to move cause my body is so irritated or I get what's like muscle spasms where my body twitches on it's own.  I also have ADD which may be part of my problem, but how do I go about this?  Sorry if this questions has been already asked.

 Thanks,

Twitching is a normal thing, don't worry about it, you are doing fine.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This is the healing place and this section of the forum, as you have obviously completely failed to recognise, is a special place where people can offer their prayers to people who are in dire need of healing.
<br>
<br>
Subsequently you have been moved to Chat.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
