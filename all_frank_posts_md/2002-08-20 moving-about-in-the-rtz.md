This question may have been asked before but I cant get the search engine to work so...
<br>
Im quite new at this but I did manage to OBE after waking up from a lucid dream a couple of times.  My problem is that I can never move very far from my body, it feels like I'm trying to walk through tar or quicksand or something like that.  Anyway the strain of this seems to force me back into my body.  So if anyone has any ideas on how I can make moving about on the astral any easier it would be much appreciated.

Hi..in "astral dynamics" robert bruce explains that many projections like yours are due to a disruption in the multilevel sleep projection.. Here's what he says.."During the course of a full multilevel sleep projection, the physical/etheric body wakes up, usually experiencing projection-related symptoms and vibrations. The sleeping real-time double is already projected and is floating, asleep, just above the physical body at this time. All its higher aspects have, also, already been projected into their related dimensional levels. As the physical/etheric mind awakes beneath it, the real-time double only is reeled back into the physical/etheric body.  All the higher projected doubles continue existing and/or functioning in their higher levels, albeit a little more sluggishly now. The now-awake projector then experiences a spontaneous real-time projection exit, as the real-time double slips back out of the physical body again- but this time while fully awake.  Once this projection of awake real-time double is complete, the projected double finds itself extremely  weak and has great difficulty moving. usually, the projector will collapse in slow motion and become totally incapacitated very shortly after the exit"...

Hi Rachel....
<br>
<br>
I can only speak for myself, but I experience the same thing you do.  Whenever I get out of my body in the RTZ, I usually (not always) find it very tough to move until I am at least 10-15 feet AWAY from my body.  Usually this involves me CRAWLING on the floor outside of my bedroom, where I then stand up, take a few deep (astral) breaths, and get enough energy to move on without any problems.
<br>
<br>
I have always believed that this "quicksand" and sluggish feeling is due to being in such close proximity to the physical body, which naturally has an attraction to your astral body, much like a magnet.  The farther away you get from it, the less "pull" it may have on you.  But don't worry....no matter how far away from it you travel, it's still right there for you when you have to return.

It has been talked about, try searching again. It seems to be an acquired skill, so keep trying. I think one of the skills is to think yourself around, rather than brute force. Were you physically/emotionally tired the night you projected? I have found that to be one reason to feel "slugish" in the obe- besides the to close to body explanation.
<br>
However not many people talk about lucid dream projection here- how did you do it?

You should be able to go a little farther the next time it happens.Atleast this was the case with me.I would try very hard to leave my house,but I got that pulling feeling.Eventually though I did,thats when I started to leave the real time
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///zone.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

was almost like a step by step process it seemed,giving time for my mind to adjust,maybe?.
<br>
Good luck!ALPHA

The two bodies have quite a strong biomagnetic attraction. The pulling effect is like with two magnets that are slowly brought up close to each other (opposing poles, of course).
<br>
<br>
First you feel nothing, then there's a slight attraction as the magnets become within range of each other. The attraction quickly gets more intense, to the point where it reaches a critical level, and the magnets snap together. That's how projection is. You should find that if you can get beyond biomagnetic attraction range (about 6 to 12 feet or so) then the pull should be felt a lot less.
<br>
<br>
You will always have a sensation of your physical body to a greater or lesser degree, depending on circumstances. For example, I've had many a good projection completely ruined by physical-body demands.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes you will feel a strong tugging sensation. Or you get the sensation like something is wrapping itself around you, and you can't shake it off, and the like. At first you'll wonder what the heck it is. When I first realised it was my physical body trying to signal me to return, I'd often try and ignore it. Then I'd feel this almighty jolt and suddenly find myself awake in the Physical.
<br>

 I had that once, where it felt like I was walking through water, and having quite a bit of difficulty getting to the front door of my appartment. I think ti may have to do more with getting a control over moving around fully aware and lucid while out of body and less so with any attachment to the physical body. Same as it can take a while to get comfortable with flying. I still tend to land on my head :), but luckily I am never bothered anymore with difficulty detaching or being pulled back.  So I would expect it will pass.
