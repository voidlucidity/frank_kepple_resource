Hello:
<br>
<br>
Looks very new-age and not the kind of thing you'd want to be wearing during daylight hours for fear of being seen, or at least not without a big sign on your back saying, "Don't follow me I'm lost".
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I don't think that it's healthy. It is proven that magnetic fields can affect brain, so I am nearly sure that it works, but I would be afraid to test it. Even when I turn on both computers in my room, the elecromagnetic radiation level is so high that it makes me sick.

Tried this one 3 years ago. Didnt work. I think the magnetic field is much too weak.
<br>
If its effective, then its also dangerous (because its might drive unprepared people crazzy) and if its dangerous you cant sell it to people!!
