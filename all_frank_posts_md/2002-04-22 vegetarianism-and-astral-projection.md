Anybody here ever experiment with vegetarianism, especially with regards to it's effect (or non-effect) on astral projection?  While I don't think I could ever become a total vegetarian, I
<i>
 have
</i>
been thinking about cutting back on meat in general, especially red meat.  I've always read that eating a lot of meat lowers your vibes.  Any thoughts on this?

I'm vegetarian and have been for a couple of years now. It has not made a difference for me in energy or astral projection ability. I am still trying to learn astral projection. My friend who eats meat and is studying with me is also trying to learn astral projection. In general despite all our differences such as diet, our experiences have been identical.

If you have not yet, you may want to find out what blood type you have as some blood types are too acidic and do not react well to some meats and vegetables.  This type of information should be available at your local homopath or holistic healer.  For exapmple type O actually will handle mean, as A or AB will not.

My blood type is A+. I started getting sick and nauseated after eating meat. It is weird. I can drink alcohol and be around people using tobacco, but meat just doesn't make me feel good.

Experimented for some time on this topic, years ago. Tried vegetarian, vegan, raw, fruit, et al. Didn't make a scrap of difference. Well, not with me at any rate.
