To all members:
<br>
<br>
This is the 'official' sticky to make arrangements, discuss, and report results for the upcoming Astral Pulse Island Weekend.
<br>
<br>
It runs from Friday Evening 27th of May until Monday Morning 30th May 2005.
<br>
<br>
A picture and other information on the locale can be found here:

<br>
<br>
For now, the weekend will continue to be held every fortnight.
<br>
<br>
Good luck everyone - and don't forget your shades - I've arranged for the weather to be HOT!
<br>

Yep:

<br>
I'll try and make it too. I'll be lying on the beach sunbathing in my skimpy speedos, lol.

Although I haven't been in the "astral pulse island" forum for a while, (this is the first time I've read this thread) I awoke on Sunday with a strong feeling that I'd just visited the API.
<br>
<br>
Now, my recollections of this exerience are mere fragments, yet I am certain that I saw Adrian, sitting down. Yet, he was moving.
<br>
<br>
Hmm... Given a bit more thought, perhaps it was me moving, Adrian sitting still ! that would make more sense.
<br>
<br>
Other than that, I cannot recall anything about the API environment, which immediately causes me to question the validity / reality of my experience...
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
Mark
