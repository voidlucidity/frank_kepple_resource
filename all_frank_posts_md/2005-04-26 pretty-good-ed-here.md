<section>
so glad to have found this group.  I'm an old fart who lives in the woods of Northern Minnesota U.S.ofA.  I have little recollection of OOBs in this lifetime but I have very vivid memories of Astral travel during the time spent before this lifetime.  I,m working on conscious use of OOBs but have had very little success so far.  Wish me luck and I'll keep coming back to be a bit jealous of all the others success
