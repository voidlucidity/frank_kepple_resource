Don't forget everyone - it's Frank's birthday tomorrow and there is a party at the Island.
<br>
<br>
I tried to get there today, but my mind wasn't focused...
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
<br>
If someone fancies going there later (I will try again too), please take some party stuff (balloons, hooters, party poppers, all that jazz), and hopefully we'll get that Island rocking...
<br>
<br>
Frank - what time does it all kick off tomorrow?

Great experience Major Tom - lots going on there then!!
<br>
<br>
What is it about false awakenings?  They're really bizarre.
<br>
<br>
Hope to see you at the party.

Abba, hmm, you guys can do your "Abba" thing by the pool. We got drum &amp; bass going on by the pyramid and skinny-dipping in the sea at midnight. That old shark that normally pops his head up is night-blind anyway, so there'll be no leaving your head and shoulders on the beach for us to find in the morning, lol.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

My mind has been doing my head in these last few days - it won't listen to me, and keeps going off to do its own thing.

<br>
<br>
So, if I don't make it - have a drink on me.  Mine's a large glass of Merlot...
