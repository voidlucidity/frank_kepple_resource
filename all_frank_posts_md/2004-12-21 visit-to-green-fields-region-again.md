<section>
last night i visited this interesting astral region, where i went twice before. The last time, I met a group of people i seemed to know very well but for the life of me i can't remember who they are afterwards!
<br>
<br>
The feeling of homecoming and love from these characters is quite astonishing, resulting in me caliing one of them 'dad' last time for some reason!
<br>
<br>
This place seems recognisable due to the golden radience emanating from it, the grass is a wonderful green, the sky a wonderful blue, the sun in the sky but with a golden sunset effect permeating everything, gently rolling hills etc... anyone else been here? It is quite stable too which i like.
<br>
<br>
Once again, i felt the 'pull' which always brings me here and where i feel i have to seek out those people i know here.
<br>
<br>
however, this time, instead of just finding 'my group' as it were, i came across lots of people all sitting around in different groups on the grass, over quite a large area.
<br>
<br>
As soon as i got there i immdetialty went to the first group i came across and said hello and so on.. however this time the people in this group were not quite as openly firendly as i am used to here; when i said hello to the guys there one of them looked slightly miffed (only slightly) and nodded over to another group, saying 'thats the ones you are looking for over there'.. er ok then i said and moved to the other group.. right away i recognised the other group and they were all smiles etc and I felt right at home there although I dont remember saying anything of any great worth..
<br>
<br>
Just when things got interesting i got zapped back, as usual.. still i am chuffed with the progress as I feel that this region is important somehow.
<br>
I am wondering about the less than ecstatic responce from the first group however, as the overriding attitude in this place is one of friendliness.
<br>
<br>
Is it just because some people get slightly irritated by half aware types (I woke up via a dream) turning up now and again and annoying people with pointless questions and dumb responces? or was it more likely that it was my OWN perceptions colouring my interpretations? in which case, this guy was perfectly fine and it was me who misinterpetated what was going on..
<br>
<br>
either way, I'm not too worried and i aim to get back there..
<br>
I have found my 'key' to getting back i think, I just need to focus on that wonderful golden light and green grass and i feel that pull again..
<br>
<br>
Hopefully tonight i will get back there again..
<br>
<br>
All for now
<br>

Douglas:
<br>
<br>
In Monroe terms, the mental focus region sounds very much like 27. Also, I wouldn't get involved too much regarding the attitude of the person you met originally. It could be some aspect of yourself colouring your experience or the guy may have been a bit miffed. It happens!
<br>
<br>
Within F27, you do tend to get all manner of people waiting around for one reason or another. Many of these people have been through difficult transitions following their physical-focus experience. So you can meet people who have still a bit of "attitude" about them; nervousness is very common, being slightly irritable is another. That's why you find these great areas set out as parks, with lovely flowers and great sunsets, things like that, where people can just sit down and chill out.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I think I've been there, and met a long-lost someone or other and felt such amazing love from him, but I never found out who he was.

Hi Douglas,
<br>
Sounds like you have found some things of great importance.  Firstly, you found for yourself the Key to navigating the realms...  to go to the 'grassy place' again you only need to prepare for meditation/projection and then remember the Feeling of being there... this is like dialing the number to get what you are after.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, you found what Monroe called focus 27.  The Park.  Some people get there 'accidentally', some go knowingly and others may never get there ! You my friend have naturally found your way to this place.  During my earlier journeys there I used to find people sitting and talking with Mentors (guides) etc, and communicating with their particular soul level groups, just as you did.
<br>
<br>
Reaching this awareness layer voluntarily is very important for continued growth into your own higher awareness layers, and there are many, many more layers/levels above the astral.
<br>
<br>
It's all good Douglas.

Hi Doug,
<br>
<br>
How fantastic for you. I wont admit to having conscious memory of being in similar areas that often, but had an experience of meeting my mum shortly after she passed in beautiful open parkland very like the place you describe a couple of times. Although they were short hops they were very peaceful and heavenly experiences.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>

Yes I recognize it very well. To me it sounds like and feels like the rainbow lands Robert talks about. I have been there often and always get totally emotional due to the peaceful atmosphere that seems to permeate everything.
<br>

Is this reminiscent of an impressionist  painting in the park ?

<br>
Is your Dad passed over ..in spirit ?
<br>
Do you recall sitting with the group that knew you for lessons ?
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you went to a class area to meet your peers and that another group which was in session already redirected you to the appropriate meeting place seemingly a bit annoyed at being disrupted from their own "lessons".
<br>
<br>
I cannot say without more detail , but it certainly sounds like the Lycee on the Astral Plane .That is a park setting of green hills . It is  a metaphysical college outdoors where students learn in a seminar forum approach like the first universities in Greece upon hilltops in the fresh air .
<br>
<br>
Here a spirit is the facilitator and the students are peers on the same level projecting either alive from their dreamstate or from the spirit world.  Dad could have been there . Did it look like him ?

<br>
<br>
Yeah.. the painting kind of reminds me of that region, although perhaps a little more 'wild' than that but along similar lines.
<br>
<br>
My dad is still around but perhaps it was my dad from a previous life, or perhaps the person had a kind of paternal radience which I picked up on.. as i say, i was sure i knew these people but i just couldnt rememeber from where!
<br>
<br>
Yes, im sure it was some kind of 'class' although i dont recall 'lessons' at at all, but  the 'dream school' scenario, as they call it doesnt sound out of place for this area and what i experienced. A park setting of green hills i bang on what I experienced, although there is always a wonderful golden 'sunset' effect going on when I'm there.

<section>
I see a snapshot of you standing on at the bottom of a hill and
<br>
the group sitting down on the ground in a group more like a filled in circle than a ring and then up on the hill i see someone waving too you and you walk up there effortlessly like floating upright a group sitting there welcomes you behind them at  top of the hill is a fence that is black and metallic to the left of the first group below there is water and trees along the water's edge but not in this snapshot and to the right is the entrance to a college through the gate of the fence you are gathering with peers to decide upon a course to tell of your goals and strengths and make a plan .
<br>
Most of the people i see there are male and dressed contemporary but very smart casual like long sleeve shirts button down with collar and slacks or jeans . I cannot see this as a present image only a clairvoyant glimpse of the past which may not be as accurate as i would like lol
<br>
would you humour me though please and find the gate and tell me if the school looks like what i see i will wait to confirm before posting that lol

Hi Redcatherine_
<br>
<br>
I will certainly look out for this next time I appear there and let you know (i will remember to remember about it, if you know what i mean), however this might not be right away as I cant really control my visits there right now, it kind of happens at random (or thats how it appears at least).. I will get back to you next time I'm there!
