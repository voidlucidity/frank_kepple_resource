Hi all,
<br>
<br>
I have a few of questions regarding phasing as apposed to AP'ing. Sorry if these have been raised and answered elsewhere but with such a vast amount of information on this forum i get lost in what i have and haven't read.
<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, here are my questions:-
<br>
<br>
1. With respect to AP i hear mention of relaxing, quietening the mind, energy raising and manipulation (NEW), exit techniques etc are required for an OBE. Am i correct in assuming that only the ability to relax and focus are required for phasing? I only ask as i seem to have hit a wall with regards to energy raising, exit techniques etc. If phasing is simply about focusing, it sounds like a much easier approach.
<br>
<br>
2. From reading RB's books and reading postings by other members, it seems like it is difficult to hold an OBE for more than few minutes. Is this still true when phasing or can the experiences last longer?
<br>
<br>
3. Is memory recal (shadow memories etc) a problem when phasing as it is when AP'ing ?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
Matt.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Phasing is all about focusing, yes. As to whether that is any easier for any one particular individual depends on the person in question. There are people who take the more traditional routes and do very well with them. But if you are hitting a wall, there is no sense in keep hitting it. Time to try a new approach I would say is the logical course, which is about where you are at.
<br>
<br>
With Phasing the experiences typically last half an hour, or thereabouts. But I have been "out" so to speak, for several hours of physical time many, many times before. Often, I am out
<u>
 so

long it feels a bit strange coming back to physical reality again. You want to just fly to the shops rather than drive. :)
<br>
<br>
Problem is, the more hurdles you present yourself with, the more difficult it will become for you. If you feel that having to go through many different practices is necessary beforehand then, after a while, this can seem like a bit of a burden when all you really want to do is have some meaningful, non-physical experiences.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing approach holds the promise of being a short-circuit to rapid non-physical experiences. But always remember you can "convert" these experiences into the more esoteric, real-time zone, second-body, floating around your neighbourhood types of experiences at a later date. So it's not like any Phasing practice you put in will be wasted. On the contrary, the Phasing model does incorporate the more traditional RTZ projections, but just goes about it in a different way.
<br>
<br>
I never had any problems with memory recall with the Phasing approach. I think this is only really an issue with the more traditional approaches due to the "separation" factors involved.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
