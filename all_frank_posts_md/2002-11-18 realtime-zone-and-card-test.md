Hi!
<br>
<br>
<br>
I Have "problem" in my belief "system" because I come from country where  people dont´believe things like  OBE.I have many experiences that I have to say they were something weird  and just WOW what it was.....but our brain I so wonderfull
<br>
"machine" that it can create very very odd
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///things.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 things.So
</a>
how many of you have tried to put a card or something and checked it when you are in real time zone?When I can do this then I have to believe this.I know I´m just hard bone head who dont  wanna believe nothing unless it can be proven.Thats why I´m so interst abouit real time zone ,I can prove all this to myself, because I think I´ts maybe prevent me to get more this kind of experinces  because I dont believe 100% to this stuff.This maybe sound funny or silly but maybe there is other people too who had also  "fighted"  with themself to believe or not to believe.

I think such thinking has occured to all of us at some stage. The card idea has been put forward before, and if you feel that such will be beneficial to you then why not give it a try. By all means let us know how you get on.

obe is real it happened to me when I was a child I didn't even know what it was until now but I remembered it all through my years when I had an ear infection I fainted in the pharmacy I was on the top right corner above my body seeing my mom screaming for help and even saw myself rolled into an ambulance now I found out it was an obe.  In the bible it says we have a celestial body
<br>
<br>
quote from bible:
<br>
(1 Corinthians 15:40)
<br>
There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
<br>
(1 Corinthians 15:44)
<br>
it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
<br>
<br>
Psychology they call it the etheric body, now they proved recently since we're still alive in the body the etheric body stays but really the astral projected double leaves the area then comes back to reconnect, maybe my body was the celestial/etheric since it was near or above my physical body incident occured.

Hi Telecaster !
<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that you are not the only one in your country who believes in OBE's......check out the posts by Jilola, which are very interesting !
<br>
<br>
You also mention :
<br>
<br>
"This maybe sound funny or silly but maybe there is other people too who had also "fighted" with themself to believe or not to believe."
<br>
<br>
I think there are plenty of us who are looking for some sort of "proof" - and this doesn't seem to be just the amateurs like me. Take a look in the astral conciousness page, and Ginny's post on "focus 27, my special place" ..(it should be at the top of the page). The guys and girls who have made comments there are very knowledgeable and experienced, and they talk about "partnered explorations" where they verify things they experienced in the astral.
<br>
<br>
cheers,

everybody has trouble believing that OBEs are real because for most people they have been brought up to believe that only the physical world exists and everything else is just fiction. if u have an OBE it should make things a lot better.

The problem with the card test is the Real Time Zone.  It fluctuates, maybe if I had more experience I would be able to control it better but here is my last attempt as an example:
<br>
<br>
I got out of body, was so real that as I went to the window to look at the card, I found myself thinking "what am I doing looking at the card now, I have to have an OBE to look at the card!".  Anyway, I go to the window and take the card off (would not have been able to do this really) and I looked at it.  The card was all sparkly white with little red symbols that kept appearing and then dissapearing!  Then I get distracted by things around the room that shouldn't be there, like the phone was on the bed.  I got really angry at this and threw it off.
<br>
<br>
I dont know what the answer is to get a clear perception in the Real Time Zone - maybe you need a lot of energy to be able to withstand the fluctuations.

That's exactly it. Rarely does it happen, but people have been able to mistake the RT zone for the physical. It happens to projectors with enough energy to do so (advanced ones usually).

Hey,
<br>
<br>
I just thought of this. Perhaps a better test would be to have a friend place a large object in the next room that wasn't there before. When the projector goes OBE they can go into the next room and tell the friend what the object was.
<br>
<br>
If we're using large, obvious objects, as opposed to little cards or numbers, then maybe our mind won't distort them so much.
