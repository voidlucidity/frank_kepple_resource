sounds like either you phased or ended up drifting off into sleep and entered a dream based on your imaginings.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The above is a classic example of you making what I term "the switch". You create an imaginary scenario and then, at some stage, you find yourself actually acting out that scenario from a 1st-person perspective. In other words you have switched your focus of attention to another area in your consciousness continuum. The faculty of your imagination is a very powerful aid to you doing this.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
