<section>
Ok guys, I'm having the hardest time trying to stay awake when I want to project at night.  Here is basically what im doing in hopes of having an OOBE.
<br>
<br>
1) I lay in my bed and make sure everything is relaxed. Usually my eyes want to come open or at least stay somewhat open and my jaw wants to drop creating an uncomfortable breathing feeling for me when I relax my head.
<br>
<br>
2) once I try to work out number 1's comfort issues .. I try to breath in the white clouds of energy and breath out toxic stressful clouds to put myself in a trance...I get feelings of .. falling slowly ... time slowing down .. and something which I just found out is probably know as the "void"  .. its where I see the blackness behind my eyes get a lot bigger .. like a galaxy without stars .. but I dont know what to do with these .. or if I should do anything at all.
<br>
<br>
3) I sometimes get voices and random sounds that are usually quite loud in my head or I may hear what sounds like my voice really really loud .  I heard my door slam or something one time .  I also heard someone calling the name "Tina" .. after that session of random noises (which may only has 4 seconds or so ) I get random thoughts  .. jst anything  .. like a big hamburger falling off a table or something quite silly.
<br>
<br>
4) then I fall asleep ... So I think  most of the times , right after the random silly thoughts , I fall asleep.. I dont know how to keep myself awake .. what I should focus on  or if I should focus on anything in particular .. maybe someone can give me some insight on this ? Thanks all!  If I leave out anything .. Ill try to edit my post =P
<br>
<br>
Thanks again
<br>

<br>
From what you say about images, random sounds, etc. you are relaxing to the Focus 12 state (in Monroe-speak). At this point your focal point of awareness is very close to the Astral border where it joins to your higher imaginative consciousness.
<br>
<br>
At the point where you begin to perceive the imagery has taken on a 3D quality, you need to become a little more active, mentally. Because I think your main problem could be lack of any real intent to do something in particular.
<br>
<br>
You see, once you get to a certain stage you are free to go. The exact details of when that stage arrives is slightly different for each person. With me I perceive the 3D blackness, then dark shadowy figures which turn into a whirling coloured fog, then the Astral landscape comes into view. Note: it is common for people to perceive tunnel or grid structures rather than a landscape effect. But, for some reason, I always seem to perceive a landscape.
<br>
<br>
Once I perceive the 3D blackness turn into whirls of colour, I then hold in mind a picture which, to the best degree possible, sums up my Intent.  (NOTE: that's why it is best to keep your intention simple so you can capture the gist of it with a simple image). Reason being, once I percieve the Astral landscape I am at the Astral bridge-zone at mental Focus 21. This is the beginning of the state where thought equals direct action.
<br>
<br>
So, by holding an image in mind which sums up my Intent, the moment I reach Focus 21 that image is released as a thought-wave which goes to fuel the next step in my progression. Which, nowadays, is normally to visit the library at Focus 27. But my suggestion would be for yourself to first put out the idea of contacting a guide. As you will make much faster progress in the long run.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I have similar problems with hearing my own voice, it scares the hell outta me, ending the whole experiance. And my eyes seem to open themselves, I have to really struggle to keep em closed sometimes. Well, i'm not an expert, far from it, but I used that expanding blackness to my advantage.
<br>
<br>
For some reason when it's happening it's like its constantly expanding past my field of vision, which can give me the feeling of going up. When the black gets bigger, try to imagine your going up, but when you do believe you're going up.
<br>
<br>
This might work it might not, but it sounds like we're in the same situation and I got the vibrations for the first time yesterday but wimped out
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
<br>
Wish I hadn't now. Also, if you can feel you brow chakra concentrate on it. I imagined that something was pushing down hard on my forehead where I could feel the sensation and I mentally pushed back, which seemed to work, but I also suffer from a quite excited heart chakra which seems to have the intention of escaping.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, like I said i'm not an expert, i've not even had an OBE but yesterday was the closest i've come and your situation is similar to mine. Good luck!

<section>
phew , thanks for your posts guys , I feel that maybe I have something new to try.  And last night when I was trying to contact my guide I have a strange experience .. I felt as though I was being rude to my guide since I asked him/her to show some proof that they were listening to me and that I wont be answering myself in my mental conversations .. nothing happened so I said to myself .. ok I'll try later .. cause I was eating a bowl of cereal at the time  =P  .. well .. On my way back to my room .. in the dark hallway , I saw a small orb of bright light make a circular motion towards the floor about a footlong in its path and it scared the ever lovin crap outta me hehe . I dont know if it was my guide showing me the sign I asked for or what but I had a very strange sensation fall over my body .. I nearly jumped outta my skin.  I havent heard my guide's voice yet but I hope to soon ...
<br>
<br>
Frank:  When is the best time to ask for your guide ? I'm not sure when to do it.. Is it when I start seeing that big blackness or when I get some sensations of trance ? And where can I find out about all the Focuses .. what are they ? Are they on those tapes you guys talk about ?  I dont have any money to buy anything really ..  Icant afford any tapes.  I wish I could find out about phasing somewhere on the net. Is there a resourse I can check out about phasing and how it can be used to go astral ? Thanks guys!

is the focus stuff only from the tapes that you buy from the monroe institute or something ?  I hope theres a database on the web that I can view to learn about the phasing and all. Does anyone know for sure where it is or if its just from the tapes/CDs.

There has been a lot of discussion on the Focus levels and phasing right here on this message forum.  Use the search feature to find anything on 'Focus Levels' and 'Phasing; and I promise you that you'll find something.

Put out a strong intent when you sense the big blackness - which is what I call the 3D blackness. Then just flow along with it, holding the intent in mind.
<br>
<br>
It's also best to be as specific as you can. With me, it's almost always a case of "another morning, another mystery." (I do my projection practice early morning) In other words, every projection tends to produce more questions than it answers. What I do next, during the day, is try and sort out just one or two main questions where, if I got some kind of definite answer to those one or two, then the answers to the rest would kinda fall into place.
<br>
<br>
Then I develop the intent to the extent where, as I awake, that intent immediately pops into mind. By developing the Intent, I mean I'll ponder over it throughout the day.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
