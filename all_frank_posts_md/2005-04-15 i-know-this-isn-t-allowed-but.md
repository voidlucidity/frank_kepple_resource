Sorry, I had to create a new temporary user name, not because my old one is stuffed or anything, but because I'm having some problems with my mum getting all upset and having kittens about the fact that I'm actually using these forums.  She doesn't beleive in AP, and is trying to scare me out of it so in an effort to stop her reading my posts, I've had to create a new username for a while.  I'm really sorry, I know it's not allowed but I want my messages to be private.  My mum and I have already had a few arguments about the topic and I want to be able to get the help I need without her knowing everything!

Read between the "lines" ha ha, good one -lines-.
<br>
<br>
Multiple usernames are not allowed because we gauge people who create all manner of names would do so merely to create mischief, as opposed to wanting to make a valid contribution to the forum. At the same time it would only be reasonable to recognise that there may be the odd occasion where a member may have to create another user account. What the Major is saying is that this is obviously one of those occasions.

Pull her out. Not when she sleeps... no no. Pull her out when she's watching tv or something.
