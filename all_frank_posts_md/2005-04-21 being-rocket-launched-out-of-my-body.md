I had an OBE this morning, where I had numerous attempts at leaving my body.  It was pretty mundane, lots of not being able to see, and my usual shenanigans, however, there was something that stood out.
<br>
<br>
I "awoke" because I noticed that my upper body was swaying backwards and forwards in slow motion.  At first I thought, "
<i>
 Mmm, this is pleasant
</i>
", then I started to realise that it was highly unlikely to be my physical body.

<br>
<br>
The next thing I know, my second body
<u>
 shot
</u>
across the room at an incredible speed and 'slammed' into the wall at the other side.  This seemingly wasn't anything I'd planned, I don't remember having any "
<i>
 I must get out
</i>
" thoughts.  I sat there slumped against the wall completely stunned wondering what the hell had just happened.  Then I looked back at the bed and instantly I was physical again.  I was able to create the swaying motion and continued with the experience (which I won't bother repeating – it's mainly dull stuff).
<br>
<br>
Has this happened to anyone else?  I know I'm not the only one – Bob Monroe experienced it in his first book.  Normally, I would be inclined to think that if I'd recently read about it, chances are that would have triggered it.  But I read that book nearly two years ago.
<br>
<br>
It sure was something new for the journal!!

I had a similer experience Tuesday night. I remember "waking up" and trying to shoo a misty form away that was hovering over the bed. I assumed it was either the house spook or my imagination and simply wanted to sleep. I shooed it away three times then suddenly I was yanked upward and found myself plastered against the ceiling. All I could say was, "Huh, guess I'm asleep." Apparently, I had been asleep the entire time I thought I was waving off the smoky annoyance. It was a different experience to say the least.

I have read about this as a technique to getting out ? they say you will come right back if its your first time because of how you leave your body

I often get the swaying feeling.  I never have been shot out like that though!  Pretty cool, I'll have to experiment a bit more with the swaying... didn't realize something like that could come of it.

I've been shot out a few times after I had changed sleeping positions and slept on the couch.  The first time it happened I shot straight up at a very fast speed for about 5 seconds.  I was frightened, blind, and I had duel awareness of my physical body as it was happening.  The other time I shot straight up fast then I found myself staring at the texture on the ceiling for a few seconds before it ended.

This used to happen to me all the time. I called it my "cannonball exit" because it literally felt like I had been shot from a cannon. If you do a search on that term it should throw up a number of posts.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

<section>
Cheers everyone for your replies - quite a novel way for me to exit - I normally spend half my allotted time trying to extract limbs and remove imaginary blankets that weigh me down.
<br>
<br>
I think it was the slamming into the wall that suprised me most.  Obviously, it didn't hurt a bit.  But I normally go through walls, especially at those kinds of speeds!
<br>
<br>
Just when I thought there were no more surprises with RTZ OBEs...

I've had at least a couple of
<i>
 very
</i>
interesting OBE's in which I shot myself out of my body like a bullet,and soared straight into space in the RTZ.
<br>
<br>
Something I'll never forget

I had the whole RTZ space thing, I recently posted it actually but it was amazing!  I had been in a dream that was way too vivid, wondered if I was dreaming, realised that I was, then tried to fl.  I got yanked back by this massive force thing and ended up rocketing off into space heading towards the moon.  Problem was, I hadn't intened any of that to happen and it did.  And when I woke, I forgot about it and then about three hours later, something triggered the memory and it all came rushing back and it was like "whoa dude!" and I was tripping out for about an hour tryna take it all in.

I was considering this last night before bed. I thought back to something I've read here or in Astral Dynamics. If your projection can occur without your consciences then perhaps the rocket launched sensation is simply your consciences suddenly catching up with your projection. Another words, maybe your consciences is simply going from your physical body's local to your projections local, of form of shifting your awareness.
<br>
<br>
Just a thought.
