Hallo peoples,
<br>
<br>
<br>
While browsing this site I noticed all the focus and phasing talk and I'm trying to get some understanding of the concept, but I'm failing, it's not at all easy to get an understanding of. I'm currently reading adrian's book, which is great I think, but it doesn't seem to be (in my mind) anything like what frank and others are talking about so that doesn't help either.
<br>
<br>
But!, I have a plan, I figure it is basically useless for me to try and figure this whole thing out, it would cause me a major information overload. So ill take a small bite at a time as not to get to many things together in my mind, and not create a mess in my mind.
<br>
<br>
So to start, if someone could clearly explain to me what F2oC means, a detailed explanation would be nice.

Focus 2 of Consciousness, or F2oC is your individual area of consciousness. It is where your memories are stored, as well as where (i believe) all your cognitive processes happen.(Thinking, doing, contemplating, etc.)  Its also what people mean by "imagination".When you phase, if you choose to do a mental rundown, this will happen in f2oc and at some point you will make the "switch" from observer to actually BEING THERE.
<br>
<br>
From that point you can phase on to F3/F4 or go into the RTZ.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Adrian tends to take a more outreaching approach whereas I am more nitty-gritty. I'm not sure how detailed you would like an explanation of F2 to be. Ben kinda hit the nail on the head explanation wise.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank i would like to ask you about this as well
<br>
i read the newsletter and i agree with you on your description.
<br>
I just don't always have that much trust in myself...
<br>
What I'm wondering is how-to as i know i really should not..
<br>
Do i go with the flow? Do i focus myself 100% "in" myself to shift...
<br>
I have gotten as far as having REM while still being aware.. I can feel my physical body (but not to a great sensation) I all ways get in to Light trance or near Trance when i normally do energy work.
<br>
When i have had clear OBEs in the past i have always felt like i first feel asleep then woke up just before i "leave" the body and then been able to take control..
<br>
I know this is just another question about how-to or what-to expect..
<br>
But pleas give me answer on this Frank..
<br>
<br>
Sorry to break subject

Are there others living there? Is it anything like the astral worlds?

No no other people "live" there.  As for astral worlds i really have no idea what you mean.  when most people say they visit the "astral realms" or whateve, they usually mean F2oC.

for an explaination on Frank's Phasing terms and techniques you can try looking in the Astral FAQ section on this forum. You'll see a bunch of permanent topices.

I have done that over the past few days and I think I now have general grasp on phasing, but I like to know what benefits there is to this, besides it being fun (I'm sure!) for my life.
<br>
<br>
I have read on Frank's site some promising things (control your future physical reality, healing, and among other things), I would like to hear how this actually works. (as frank has not yet released his book, btw when will this happen?)

Focus 2 is kinda fun, but Focus 3 is where the learning starts.  For example Frank wrote:

 As regards the people you are seeing, you have to begin to accept that when you shift to Focus 3 you WILL come across all manner of other people. These people are not "figments of your imagination" they are actually other people engaged within Transition. One of the freakiest things that would happen to me is people would greet me like a close friend and I simply would not have a clue who they were. But all of us have what I call a non-physical family. These are people that know us and we tend to gravitate towards them for all manner of reasons.
 <br>
 <br>
 In time you will learn to overcome your fears and simply get used to meeting and greeting these people. The simplest way to find out who they are is to stick around long enough to ask.

This is where the "heavens" are for the religions and so on.  Although, in Focus 2 you can shape your physical reality.  for instance, if you create things in focus 2 then they may manifest in the physical reality.  Frank talks about this on his site, but I have yet to fully grasp the technique.  I guess I will wait for the book.

Frank says that focus 4 is WAY out there and rarely talks about it, but I will one day get there and find out for myself.

AS:
<br>
<br>
What you are attempting to do is very much the same as when you have had OBEs in the past, only you are not falling asleep first and then waking up to take control. You let your physical body fall asleep, but you keep your actual mind awake. Hence the term Mind Awake Body Asleep of the Monroe Focus 10 state, or MABA for short.
<br>
<br>
To do this, you have to look WITHIN yourself, yes. No matter whether you want to project into the RTZ in a conventional sense or Phase in a more modern-day sense, it is all within you. The whole idea of all the exercises is to seek out that point in your mind that you can look to and feel that connection with your wider reality. I promise you it is there, in your mind. It just takes a little practice to find that exact point. With me it is almost straight up and back a bit. Once you find that point it's like, wow, and all the lights come on. You start seeing all manner of images and that's when the fun begins.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
