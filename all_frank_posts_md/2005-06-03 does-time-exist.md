I don't know if this is the right place for this question... please move it to appropriate spot if necessary.
<br>
<br>
Does time exist?  Without a doubt the way it's measured and kept was designed by humans. Without a doubt it's flawed.  But is it real?  We all perceive it differently at different times.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The reason I posted it here, is I want to know if time exists in the astral planes. I heard that it doesn't.  But then again I may be wrong, that's why I come here to ask those with experience.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.

Yuriy, nice timing!

I was just pondering something and waddyaknow I log on to astral pulse and you've kind of given me the answer.
<br>
<br>
I have also heard that the astral planes are independent of time, and other realms are said to have no concept of space either.  I don't know if it's true or not.  But when they say independent of time, I think they mean, for instance, you could have an astral experience that seemed very long and come back to find only a short time had elapsed in the physical world.
<br>
<br>
The thing I was pondering was, if someone dies and is reborn in an astral realm for what seems to them like 100 years say, and then reborn as a human again.  Is there necessarily 100 years between their death and rebirth as a human?
<br>
<br>
As Einstein said - "time is what stops everything from happening all at once."

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Time obviously exists, but the notion of linear time is a physical realm construct only. Experiences within subjective reality are outside of any time constraints. Within Focus 2 and Focus 3 you can see people showing evidence of a kind of legacy of having lived within linear time constraints within the physical. But that's a local event that is all to do with the individuals in question, just the continuation of a habit rather than a specific function of the environment.
<br>
<br>
One of the most mind-blowing concepts to take in mind about the wider reality is the notion of infinity, i.e. the notion of there having been no beginning, nor will there be any end. Also, within infinity, everything happens an infinite number of times. Which is another one of those mind-blowing aspects. Also, the wider reality occupies no space. As there is no time, there is no space and distance either.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Does this mean that in subjective reality, time travel is possible? Can you enter the RTZ in different times zones?
<br>
<br>
Very interesting topic.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I don't want to sound picky, but you cannot enter the real-time zone in a different time dimension as that would be a contradiction in terms. The real time zone is so called precisely because it directly relates to the current physical circumstances.
<br>
<br>
Within subjective reality there is simply no time. So there can be no such thing as "time travel" as we understand it, as time just doesn't exist. You can, however, merge with other focuses that live within different physical dimensions. I find doing this rather difficult, a bit hit and miss and takes a lot of mental effort for no real benefit. So it's not really something I am working on perfecting at the moment as I have a number of other non-physical projects on the go.
<br>
<br>
One of the freakiest facts I came across, that I personally find fascinating, is there are a HUGE number of other physical universes, possibly an infinite number. But get this, they all occupy the
<i>
 same
</i>
physical space! That's freaky. Now, in my attempts to understand how this is possible, I discovered there are what are called Trans-Dimensional Areas in consciousness that allow actual physical universes to overlay each other, and each physical universe is on it's own timeline, so to speak, but in a sense they are all "connected" to Focus 4 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Knowing this hold the promise that one day it may be possible, using some kind of bio-technology craft, to actually physically transport ourselves between physical dimensions. If we could somehow crack the code, so to speak, and understand how these Trans-Dimensional Areas function, we could one day create a device that would allow us to produce a kind of wormhole effect so we could objectively observe a portion of another physical reality. Like we were looking at it through a window. Then later we may well develop the technology to physically transport us there. I can well imagine the day when communicating with people living within a different physical dimension will be as easy as dialling a telephone. But we merely add a different suffix depending on their physical dimension identifier.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
Feel free to be as picky as you wish... I'm still getting to grips with all the different concepts which are featured here on the Astral Pulse. I'm bound contradict myself somewhere along the way hehee.
<br>
<br>
The infinite dimensions occupying the same space is a freaky concept. One which goes a long way to explaining the ghost phenomenon.

This is the reason I came here. Originaly this topic was posted in Unexplained-mysteries, but most people there are too 'liner' lol.  I like this place better because people here are a whole lot more open minded.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Time obviously exists."
<br>
<br>
"Within subjective reality there is simply no time."
<br>
<br>
So wich is it?

<section>
Time is a mental construct that living forms have evolved through Darwinian mechanisms. It is similar to other notions which we have and we take for granted, just like colors and smells etc. As we know that there is no actual physical quality called color, and it is a convenient mechanism evolved by living creatures to cope with the physical world, same goes true for the 'Time'.
<br>
<br>
'Time' is our subjective interpretation of a specific law of nature - called the second law of thermodynamics. Time is not something which passes by or flows, it is an illusion that we perceive due to something more basic taking place in the physical universe, it is commonly called Motion. When we observe time passing by on a clock, its not something actually passing, its a product of interaction of Motion with consciousness and memory.
<br>
<br>
Motion is usually expressed in terms of space and time, but it is motion itself that creates the illusions of space and time in consciousness. Motion in its pure form is pure energy, or something that we don't understand yet. It is perfectly possible that we interpret Motion in other ways during our non-physical travels.
<br>
<br>
As it is related to our physical bodies, its very obvious that it will cease to exist in this form after we lose our bodies. You can have a glimpse of the situation when you go out of the body.

<section>
Time is definitely real.  Our physical bodies exist in this 3d world.  Time is the next dimension - the 4th.
<br>
<br>
Do not make the mistake of relating time to the astral.  The astral is in the 5th dimension, and the 5th dimension is Eternity.  Time has a beginning, and will eventually have it's end.  Eternity does not have either of those.
<br>
<br>
So just remember that the next time you are out-of-body, you are experiencing a reality not only beyond the physical, but beyond time as well.

Even though time is considerably real, does that mean that there has to be a beginning and an end to it? Yea, yea it's been foreseen, people have envisioned it and a whole bunch of other stuff existing in unknown times and places, doesn't mean it's true!!!! Have any insight on this?

<section>
Anything that exists below Eternity has to have a beginning and an end.
<br>
<br>
To really understand this, you may have to do some investigating in the astral.  I would suggest calling a Master in the astral, because it would be important for you to really understand how it is that time has a beginning and an end, and not just believe something that a complete stranger would tell you.
