Suzy.....

<br>
Here's a little tip.  Any website that tries to sell you a METHOD on how to OBE quick and easy....STAY AWAY FROM IT!
<br>
<br>
It's one thing to pay for books which can help you learn about OBE's.....but it's another thing to pay for something which promises successful OBE's in a short amount of time.  That site looks like a rip off scam...very little content and only promising results after payment.
<br>
<br>
Take it from me.  There is plenty of FREE resources right here on this Message Board.  Not only that, but we are real, live people who can help answer your questions in a timely manner.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Couldn't agree more, Jeff. And I also strongly suspect that what a lot of the promotors of these sites do, is broadcast all over other people's message boards pretending to be an ordinary person seeking information.

Hmmm new poster, just 4 posts, all 4 posts are the same post just in different areas on the boards. Please ... If you are a ligit person I am sorry but this just looks like spam to me. I guess it was only a matter of time before they found their way on to these boards.

I used to know him and talk to him BEFORE he had a website.  It's a shame that he thinks he can market a "technique" and hype it up as if it's some magical formula to induce OBE's.  It's been awhile since I talked to him, and he used to be a good guy....I just feel that he let things get to his head.

<section>
Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
I would respectfully submit that the place (or at  least a place) to learn about Astral matters is right here, for free.
<br>
<br>
People like Frank can teach much more about Astral work than any number of these so called "OBE in a day" type things.
<br>
<br>
And I for one am most grateful for Frank, and everyone elses time in sharing their knowledge and experience with fellow Astral Pulse members.
<br>
<br>
If you feel you need to buy something  - I suggest that you consider Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce, and it would seem that the Monroe Institute might have something to offer as well if our recent topics ar anything to go by.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
I'm halfway tempted to buy the technique and post it here to be evaluated by everyone. If it is a waste of money, then we all can be sure it is a waste of money. If it has anything interesting to say then the cost divided by the number of people who see it is insignificant. It would be unfortunate to cause trouble, though, if there are copyright aspects to consider. Wouldn't this BBS be personal use, since we have to log in?

<section>
Greetings Tom,
<br>
<br>
Regarding the forums - publishing any proprietory information covered by copyright would be technically illegal, and not something I would sanction.
<br>
<br>
As to buying this "method" - well it is your money and your own freewill
