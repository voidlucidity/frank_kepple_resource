<section>
A long one guys, sorry-
<br>
Umm.
<br>
Well here it is: I think I might experiancing something - but Im not sure what and I'd really like some ideas.
<br>
When I try to get to sleep, I get very nasty images so vivid its as if theyre drawn on my eyelids,
<br>
They are usually of a dead girl, or blood running down a wall.
<br>
Im convinced our house has a ghost due to several reasons - could it be the girl in my head sending me messages? Do any of you know what the messages could mean or is it just my overactive imagionation??
<br>
<br>
I also think I have some kind of phycic ability (although I cant spell it) For example - my brother had a couple of friends round who I had never met. After the briefest of introductions, one of them in particular stuck in my mind, and I somehow knew something had been wrong once for her.
<br>
When I asked my brother he said she hadnt had such a good life and doesnt see her real Dad.
<br>
I normally get this and I find I can feel if someone has been unwell or bleeding - particularly if I brush past them of touch them.
<br>
I often say the same things as people I have spent time with - and I feel I can tell if people are hiding saddness.
<br>
<br>
What is this? Is it bad? Should I be doing something? Is it a heriditary gift maybe?? Help Please...anyone??
<br>
Thanks xx - Jo (email me if you'd prefer

Hi PeacePoppet,
<br>
<br>
I moved your topic for ya..[^] it was hard figuring out where to put it.  I figured since the question about the image sounded like Hypnagogic imagery, I would put it in OBE Discussions.
<br>
<br>
You'd be amazed at some of the stuff you will see, while drifting off to sleep.  Which actually is a good thing, because it shows you are still staying aware while doing so.[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]
<br>
<br>
The best thing to do is just to be as passive about what you see the best you can (it will get easier with time)
<br>
<br>
I remember about 9yrs ago, I went to bed and was doing my normal meditation routine.  Next thing I see are very huge faces floating around in front of me!  It freaked me out a bit, because these faces, not only were unfamilar but extremely angry and were coming at me.
<br>
<br>
Honestly at that time, before I knew anything about out-of-body experiences, I thought I had opened some portal of hell..hehehe,  it was that freaky!
<br>
<br>
Well, as you can see, I'm just fine and I've never seen anything like that since.  You will encounter lots of weird stuff, some might seem really scary, but do remember nothing can hurt you.[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]  Like I said, best thing to do is chaulk it up to a interesting experience but let it go, because the more you try and figure this out, the more you will give this thing....ummmm..a sort of life if you will.
<br>
<br>
Ignore and move on to the next step of getting into a deeper trance so that perhaps after a few times, you just might find yourself out of your body!
<br>
<br>
Good luck
<br>
<br>
Nay

Physchic abilities come from the soul, genetics aren't involved.  However A soul's choice of body has many factors, and your genetic parents (and the house you grow up in) can influence that choice.
<br>
<br>
Can it be a ghost?  Sure.  It could also be a non-intelligent manifestation, or a person, or several other things.
<br>
<br>
Dead Girl and blood running down walls is so cliche' nowadays.  Sorry, that sounds cass, but it's just not that scary in todays world.  Do you get any feelings?  Dread?  Fear?  Sorrow?
<br>
<br>
have you walked around teh house feeling for 'cold spots' or unusual sudden smells?

LOL!  Or......it could just be hypnagognic images...why does everything have to be either a restless ghost, a demon, or a neg?

Actually I was thinking of he himself being the source.  By doing the walk around and not finding anything offers some subconcious re-assurance.  Did I use the

Very true, and it definitely is a reassuring thing just for the reason she states: you're staying aware. That isn't easy.

I also believe this is true. It's best to dispassionately observe than to go jumping to conclusions about everything. Even

the spooky thing isn't just in your head, giving it attention isn't going to help. Usually these things are just passing.

<br>
Probably just an overactive imagination. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. To say you have psychic ability based on the fact you guessed a person had something wrong once, well, it's stretching it a bit if I may say.
<br>
<br>
Most people's lives either are, or have been, screwed in one way or another at some time. Sadness is quite a common emotion to feel. I see sadness written over most people's faces. Together with tension and fear and all manner of upset and confusion. That's just the way life is for most people in this living hell we call modern-day civilisation.

<br>
<br>
But don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking you. It's just that I tend to look at things in a fairly down to earth way. Maybe you do have something you can develop. If so then I'd advise perhaps for you to remain an observer for now. Once you get more experience then you'll also develop the ability to draw more informed conclusions.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

The more often I reach the hypnogogic state, the more careful I have to be about what I watch or do before going to bed. Not that this would be the cause for you, I dunno, but any horror movies or playing video games with violence (i.e. all of them) gives me nasty hypnogogic images. Therefore I try to limit the pre-bedtime stimulus to pleasant stuff, because I'd hate to think I was going to phase into the situation.

<section>
Thanks everyone for trying to help, but Its not quite what I meant. lol
<br>
When I see these things - Im fully awake - Im not drifting off to sleep, I dont get it when Im meditating, I looked into it and theres a type of condition very alike to what I was describing, its not an illness and usually occurs due to some kind of abuse or trauma.
<br>
Please do not say the things I see are "Cliche'" because theyre very frightening, I didnt explain the dead girls in detail because its unpleasant. I have a vivid imagionation but these pictures are nothing like anything I've ever seen before. They frighten me and keep me awake and Im starting to get worn out. [V]
<br>
<br>
About the whole phycic abilit[
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
]y thing - I didnt just "guess" - I knew. Im grateful to you all for trying to help, but I get this all the time, and I dont just see how someone is feeling, I feel it.
<br>
And what about feeling if someone has been bleeding? [:O]
<br>
<br>
Some things I see and feel are very frightening, and I honestly think someone from the other side needs help or assistance.
<br>
If anyone has any other comments or ideas I will read any suggestions.
<br>
<br>
Thankyou friends - Jo xxxx[

Oh and in answer to Rastus - well first of all...Im a she herself lol [

<br>
<br>
anyway...
<br>
I dont know about cold spots, but the smell - yes. I know this might sound "cliche" but really weird things have gone missing...like y'know the bit you twist to turn on a garden tap? It came off a totaly dissappeared, it didnt have any plant pot or drain to fall into and no surface of door to go under.

??
<br>
<br>
I also distinctly hear noises through the ceiling from upstairs - way louder than every day house noises. And once my home-alone Mum heard someone clear their throat behind her.
<br>
I know a fair bit about ghosts, its not that I need help with - but thanks anyway [^]

This board has 3 sides.
<br>
<br>
1.  The side that believes everything has a mundane explanation.
<br>
<br>
2.  The side that believes everything has a Spiritual/Astral explanation.
<br>
<br>
3.  And the side that knows it can be a bit of both.
<br>
<br>
Now in defense of the conservative side, there are a
<b>
 LOT
</b>
of posts from males between 13 and 24 that have over active imaginations, just scroll down the forums to see what I mean.  It is quite possible to self-generate some very scary stuff without really trying, especially if your just starting energy work.
<br>
<br>
Now I didn't mean to belittle a frightening experience.  I meant to belittle the entity (if there is one) involved in doing it.  I meant what was scary 20 or 30 years ago, isn't that scary in todays terms.  Look at horror movies then and now.  People have a higher 'shock' threshold.
<br>
<br>
Now if you are really serious, then PM me and we can go into details.  Remember, this board is primarily about Astral Projection, everything else is somewhat secondary [

I had a similar experience to this, it occured while doing some energy work.  Suddenly something like my astral vision kicked in except I wasn't seeing the room around me...I was seeing lots gruesome acts of violence...alota blood and sex...at one point it appeared in the first perspective as if I was in the eyes of the guy slitting some other guys throat...it shook me up pretty good.  I would pull out of it sit up...but when I went back the images would return.  I asked around about
<br>
what may have caused this and had a few people tell me that it is just astral trash energies...but I don't really know.

<section>
Do a search on Psychometry and Psychometric on the web.  It's the reading of images imprinted onto objects and areas.  That's what they meant by astral trash images.  The trick is do they repeat in the same pattern, or are they always different?  If you stop, and re-start, do tehy pick up where you left off or re-start?
