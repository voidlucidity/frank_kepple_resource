<section>
hi, this is my first post here.  I found this place because I am looking for someone to possibly help a little with my difficulties with expanding my consciousness.  I'm not quite sure what 'expanding my consciousness' would exactly even be or feel like.  Though it is a goal of mine to gain wisdom of who I am and the world I live in.  I am not sure I am ready for astral projection so mainly right now I want to open up my creative and intellectual abilities to my fullest and to experience God and love.
<br>
<br>
I am using hemi-sync's The gateway experience Wave 1 Discovery.  I am hoping that someone here might be familiar with it.
<br>
<br>
I have trouble with even being relaxed in Focus ten.  Usually I lay there and my body does not feel asleep what so ever.  I even have trouble with relaxing my eyelids and keeping them closed.  It feels like nothing much is happening.  The most I can think of is thinking I have heard weird sounds that weren't on the cd and possibly hearing other people talking but not being able to understand, sort of dreamy, like once you realize you hear it, it's gone.  Well, sort of I guess.  So the problem with Focus ten for me is that I do not feel like my body is asleep at all, it just feels like I'm laying there trying to be still and then becoming frustrated.  Sometimes my body actually gets uncomfortable and I get really hot and I start to feel very frustrated.  But when it is over my temperature and body seems to become more comfortable.  It is hard to relax while trying to be in Focus ten and it frustrating because the cd talks as though I should feel extremely relaxed.
<br>
<br>
When I try to create my Resonant Energy Balloon, REBAL, I don't see anything or really feel much of anything either.  Although there has been times I have felt safer after going through the procedure of creating it.  Sometimes it seems more like I'm pretending I am creating it.  I just did a session with it about 45 minutes ago and I noticed that I got really hot for the whole session soon after I did the resonant breathing and the procedure to create my REBAL.
<br>
<br>
I am still going to keep on trying but since I have never done this before nor have ever known anyone who has I am not sure if it is working.  I have been using Wave 1 for like 2 or 3 weeks now.  I am almost starting to worry I just can't open myself to it or that maybe it just doesn't work for me.  Is this normal?  Is there something else I should be doing?  Will things progress as I keep listening to the cds?  I have trouble relaxing my body and I don't know what to do about that.
<br>
<br>
<br>
thank you.

You could also do a search for "Wave 1" which should throw up quite a bit of information.
<br>
<br>
Happy reading!

Oh, and welcome to the Forums by the way!!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I cannot help you with the "god" thing but if you want some assistance with the Wave 1 CD, I reckon I could give you some pointers. :)
<br>
<br>
You say you are not sure what "expanding your consciousness" is. Firstly, you cannot expand your consciousness. You can widen your awareness but consciousness cannot be expanded. Consciousness is what moves us, what gives us life. Consciousness is to us as water is to a fish. Widening your awareness is all to do with offering yourself an objective knowing of the Wider Reality. In other words, gaining familiarity with other areas of consciousness
<i>
 in addition
</i>
to the physical, rather than
<i>
 instead
</i>
of the physical.
<br>
<br>
As regards your use of the CDs, I would suggest you take a BIG step back. You say you have trouble with being relaxed in focus 10. This is a contradiction in terms as focus 10 is the MABA (mind awake, body asleep) state. If you are not relaxed then you cannot be at the focus 10 state. It is useless trying to progress without being able to achieve the previous state. The CDs are an aid to achieving the various states. They in no way force the state upon you.
<br>
<br>
I always say that everything kicks-off proper at focus 10. So it's a bit of a milestone state is focus 10. The key to achieving focus 10 is achieving the focus 3 state. If you cannot achieve focus 3 then you will have problems achieving all the other states. You will simply lay back and nothing will happen (as is happening in your case). Personally, I say all you need is Wave 1 because once you can achieve a solid focus 10 that's it, you're off.
<br>
<br>
You are having difficulties relaxing your physical body for some reason. Your face and eyes need to be relaxed particularly, else you will never achieve focus 3. If you want creative inspiration then focus 3 is the state for getting in touch with this aspect of you. Any time I'm stuck for an idea I slip into the focus 3 state and I can usually get all the inspiration I need while in this state.
<br>
<br>
My advice is to put the CDs aside for a little while and spend a few weeks practicing the Noticing exercise I talk about in the FAQ section under the "What is Phasing?" topic. This little exercise gets you relaxed and looking within you and is designed to take you to the focus 3 state. Once you are comfortable with the idea of focus 3 then start with the CD and see how you go. I just feel that listening to the CD without any concrete results is simply going to frustrate you more than anything.
<br>
<br>
At the focus 10 state you "become" within your own mind in a kind of twilight zone between the physical and the start of your own mind proper. The physical is "back there" somewhere. You are totally free of it and free to simply wander about in a kind of 3D space "within your head" so to speak. This is focus 10. At focus 10, your body is NOT just very relaxed that you cannot feel it and you are perhaps seeing images in your mind that are grabbing your focus of attention. No, there is a definite shift, a definite withdrawal of your focus from the physical into your own mind. As your focus shifts, you feel it distinctly.
<br>
<br>
The preliminary state, focus 3, is a feeling of being very relaxed and having your attention focused inwards. At focus 3, you are still very much "in" the physical body but you have, in a sense, "forgotten" that you have one. Because what has happened is, your attention has turned inwards and you are now lying back looking at all the pretty patterns and things that a person typically offers themselves.
<br>
<br>
But at focus 10, there is a definite shift away from the physical. You are free to roam about within the 3D space within your mind. You have "stepped into" your mind, whereas at focus 3 you are in the position of looking into it after having turned your attention inwards. In other words, at focus 10 you have "stepped into" the area where you were looking at before at focus 3.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
