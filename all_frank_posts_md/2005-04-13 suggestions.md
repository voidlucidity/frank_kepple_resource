I'm trying very hard to have my first obe.  The problem is that I fall asleep soooo fast.  I literally will be out (asleep) within seconds.
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of maybe getting up an hour early before work, going in another room and trying.  Unfortunately I already get up at 5am so I'm afraid if I get up at 4 I will just fall right back asleep.  Also, I've always been chronically tired so "getting more sleep" is not going to be a workable solution for me.
<br>
<br>
Here's my question:  Are there others out there that have this problem and have found methods that still work for them?  I'm very determined to do this.

Try going to bed an hour before you would normally do and trying then. Or try during the day sometime if possible. These days I've taken on some odd hours so I've been grabbing projection practice when I can. This was strange at first but you quickly get used to it.

Thanks for the suggestions.  I think I am going to start trying to project at different times during the day (during the week it will have to be after work of course) and see if I start to get somewhere.
