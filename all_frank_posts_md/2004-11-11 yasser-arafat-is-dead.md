Announced this morning...
<br>
<br>
Condolences for those who loved him! And for everyone, perhaps a chance now to resolve the long running problems that have contributed to the poisoned chalice of the middle east.

What I remember most about Yasser Arafat was his true love of humanity.

All I remember was the head skarf. Never changed in all those years.

He fought for what he believed was a just cause, and for that he has my respect.  I hope palestine doesn't develop into feuding over the leadership, and I also hope israel doesn't take the opportunity to try an armed takeover...  Hopefully some peace will come of this.

Although I can't approve of murdering and blowing up innocent people I also can't place all the blame on him either. And when the time came, he did work with Rabin for Peace.
<br>
<br>
I hope peace can finally come to the Middle East.
