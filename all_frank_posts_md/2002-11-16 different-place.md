<section>
Recently i have been listening to the wave 1 hemi-sync series.  Last night I had a series of extremely vivid dreams in which when i woke up i was suprised to be in my bed, which is an extremely odd feeling.  After listening to Wave 1 discovery 3, i fell asleep.  I kept feeling these feelings of drifting off deeply, where i felt almost immobilized, i would open my eyes, and struggle to try and move my body, because it felt like i couldnt.  Soon i fell asleep, and I had a series of very wierd visions.  The first one i was sitting at my computer and my dog was sitting next to me.  I was reading the active topics on this forum, while i was petting my dog.  It was all extremely real, but kind of sluggish, as if i had smoked pot or something.  I then felt a connection with my dog, and i couldnt control my body from falling over the side of the chair with my head laying on my dog.  I could feel her fur, smell her, feel her movement, it was all extremely real.  Suddenly i woke up, opened my eyes, and my body was very immoble it was hard to move, and i was a little nervous.  At the same time i was so surprised to find that i had been sleeping, and i thought to myself oh yeah i fell asleep(very weird realization)..I shook myself out of it, and got up for a few minutes to try and get myself out of this state because it kind of spooked me.  I also noticed my dog was in the same room as me while this was happening sleeping as well.  When i went back to bed, i got into that same state of mind, that same feeling during my dream, the same feeling during the hemi-sync tape, it was all the same, very very real, detatched from my current situation.  I fell asleep again, it was like i was looking out of someone elses eyes at a crime scene.  I was in a forest area, there was people all around me.  There were 2 people dead, a black man to the left, and white man to the right, both hung by ropes tide to their feet.  there was a big drop mabye 20 ft, into a lake or pond.  There was one man tying to cut down the rope of each man while he looked the other way covering his nose.  This extremely spooked me out, it was so real.  After i had watched him cut down both men and heard them drop one after the other into the lake iI soon faded back into my bed.  I opened my eyes once again completely surprised to be there.  The last experience i had last night was this morning, all in the same state of mind, i walked to the bathroom in my house, a bathroom door to the left, a bathroom door to the right, 2 bathrooms next to each other, i seemed very familiar with this in my house, and the inside of the bathrooms were very familiar to me as well.  After peeing, lol, i woke up again with the same fascination of not believing i was in bed during that.  Almost like a 5 second amnesia where i have to collect my thoughts and remember and reaasure myself that oh yeah i did this today and i just fell asleep earlier, and everything comes back to me.  This was the wierdest night of experiences in my entire life.  I am going to listen to the hemi-sync wave again tonight, and report any other experiences i may have.  Any suggestions on what this might be?

Any suggestions as to what it might be? Yes, sure, what you are experiencing is *precisely* what you are working towards! And it sounds, from what you say, you are making good progress. Feelings of sluggishness are very normal but generally go away once you get more adept, i.e. your sense of conscious awareness becomes more alert.
<br>
<br>
The projection where you were at your computer screen sounds like a typical Focus 22 experience. This is the first mental focus level where
<i>
 thought equals direct action
</i>
. In other words, what you think, instantly becomes all around you. One of the BIG difficulties with this (as you, yourself, have now experienced) is the fact that the surroundings we create look as real, say, as our normal Physical surroundings.
<br>
<br>
The computer, the dog, etc. would have been mental constructs that were visually played out all around you. You see, as a general rule, at first if you find yourself projecting surrounded by circumstances that are immediately recognisable to you, then you are almost certainly at the Focus 22 state. Now, as you project on to the higher mental focus levels, you introduce yourself to other, more wide-ranging circumstances which typically include people and circumstances you never knowingly came across before. This, as you have also now experienced, is all *very* confusing! However, rest-assured things quickly start to fall into place as you become more adept.
<br>
<br>
Next projection to the forest area could have been a Focus 23 experience but my instinct says it was probably a little higher, say, Focus 24. Generally, from Focus 23 things really start to get really juicy, Astral exploration-wise.
<br>
<br>
Basically, the lower Astral planes are chock full of people who are acting out all manner of scenarios. And I really do mean *all* manner of scenarios you could possibly think of, and more (infinitely more). At the base level you find people engaged in the most disgusting acts of depravity, where child torture, murder, rape, et al, are the norm. As you go higher, you come across regions where people are engaged in all manner of other pursuits, many of which have a religious or mystical slant.
<br>
 <br>
 Once you can reliably project your consciousness into these regions you can have a lot of fun chatting to the locals and finding out what's what. But I do agree that it is very spooky at first because, as you rightly point out, it all seems so real. That's because it *is* real.
 <br>
 <br>
 The key thing to do, or rather not to do, is start to overly analyse whatever the circumstances are that you find yourself involved in.
 <i>
  The best state of mind to be in is that of a passive, mildly curious observer
 </i>
 . Problem is, if you begin to react to the circumstances, especially emotionally, your own release of emotion will cause reality fluctuations that can (and often do!) vary from mild to wild.
 <br>
 <br>
 What happens then is, you become entangled in a situation where you have the Astral circumstances you found yourself in. Then, superimposed on that, are the circumstances you are creating from your own release of thought-release-emotion. Which all gets mighty confusing and generally scuppers the experience. If you feel circumstances are getting out of hand, rather than try and "make it right" simply go back to Physical (C1) and project again.
 <br>
 <br>
 Best of luck in your future projection.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>

Thank you Frank, i appreciate the time you put into your post.  I am glad that you reconize what that was.  When i was engaged in the lower plane i guess you say it was, thats exactly what i did, I just observed.  Its natural for me not to react to a situation like that for it is clearly something I dont want to get involved with.  The only thing that made it wierd to me was that it was all very familiar, each experience and the fact that I woke up and was surprised to be in bed.  The dog, the dead people, and the 2 bathrooms next to each other.  Those are all 3 times and plces I dont think I have ever experienced before, but yet I felt a connection to them, I do not have 2 bathrooms in my house next to each other although it was familar to me.  It could have been something I read about called a dream pool or a dream world mabye.  I notice that sometimes when I am dreaming, or mabye I am projecting,  I can continue a dream that hasnt occured in years and I am completely familar with the things that are going on even though i had no recall of that dream for the years after I had it.  I dont know if im explaining it right, but anyway, thanks for your input.
