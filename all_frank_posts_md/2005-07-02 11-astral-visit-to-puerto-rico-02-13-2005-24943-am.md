11-Astral visit to Puerto Rico- 02-13-2005-2:49:43 AM
<br>
<br>
I visited my parents in Puerto Rico in the astral. I projected into my room, then up through the roof, out to the sky. I saw a new city, not the NY skyline, then dove at the river. I rolled around on top of the water and then reclined a moment. I decided to go to Puerto Rico. My mom was on the porch when I got there. I tried to speak to her but she could not see me. The house was dark green, old, unlike the description of their new place. They were visiting a neighbor, a fact my mother confirmed the next morning, to our utter astonishment.
<br>
<br>
This was the first Oobe I have had where someone confirmed I had visited a real place. It was definitely not my aunt's old place at "El Chino" [a small section at a curve with a swampy cove, reason for the name unknown] in Aibonito. My brother was not there; he's in New York right now [travels back and forth a bit too much]. I went to the back of the house to see my dad. He was tanned, well fed and happy, wearing his glasses. He was in the back yard, which was very large. It was not sunny but rather late in the day. He was sitting on lawn furniture accompanied by a guy whom I did not quite identify. The house felt comfortable and cozy. I passed a bunch of kids as I went to the yard. I will check with my mom to see if the place sounds familiar. The trip began to end as I approached my father, but it was good to see how he's doing.
<br>
<br>
I had not consciously projected in a while, so I was careful to not get overexcited. I carefully opened my astral eyes and saw what I did and moved by power of thought. I appeared in Puerto Rico instantaneously. I feel so good right now.

The morning after my Puerto Rico Oobe, I called my mom and told her. I described what I saw, and to my amazement it turned out to be her neighbor's house. This is a milestone among my recorded oobe accounts because it's the first time another person objectively verified that my Oobe destination was a physical-world location. So yes, you can really show up somewhere at will. Just think, it's 3 hours away from New York by plane; just by thinking about it I was there instantly. I think the fact that these past several months have been the longest time ever we've been apart especially helped energize my oobe. Motivation counts.
