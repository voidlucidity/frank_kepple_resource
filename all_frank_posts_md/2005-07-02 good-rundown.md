Here's a rundown I've been playing with:
<br>
<br>
I imagine myself in 1st person at a neighborhood swimming pool I grew up near.  Smelling the chlorine in the air, I walk across the concrete, feeling it on my bare feet, towards the diving board. I feel the steps on my feet and the course-ness of the board, and feel the metal hand-rails. I can feel the sun on me and a breeze that makes me a little cold from being wet.  I run and jump off the end, hearing the bounce of the board and the splash of the water, then the quiet, mute underwater noises, pushing myself off the bottom towards the ladder, climbing up and doing it over and over again.
<br>
<br>
Is this what I'm looking for in a rundown?  I haven't phased doing it, but it keeps my senses engaged and focused away from my physical body - that's the idea, right?

Hi Stookie
<br>
<br>
I'd say that was a fine rundown.
<br>
<br>
If you get bored, swim a few laps too - and really get into the sensations of swimming.
<br>
<br>
Keep us informed of your progress!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
A good rundown is something that captures the attention and engages the senses. Make it too simple and you'll get bored and give up or fall asleep. Make it too complex and you'll likely lose the thread of it, then get bored or fall asleep. Also, it would be helpful engaging the Monroe focus 3 state before initiating your rundown.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
