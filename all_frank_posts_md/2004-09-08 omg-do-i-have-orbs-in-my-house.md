<section>
Ok, so I was taking pictures of my kitchen today for a friend... we just moved into a new house a few weeks ago. I took them with my digital camera and after I tranfered the pictures to the computer I noticed 2 balls of light on one of the pictures. Its not in ANY of the other pictures, so I know it wasn't a lens spot or glare b/c I took all the pictures in sequence. I am including the links to a close up shot and the full shot. I would like some opinions, I think they are orbs, but I am also not an expert lol. So anyone who knows anything about this PLEASE tell me! I am so curious! I have not done anything to the pictures but cropped the one, and before I cropped it I lightened it up b/c the transfer from my digi camera was dark. And also if there is a better site or forum for me to post this on please let me know ASAP!
<br>
<br>
Thanks!

Those are lens flares. The glares off of the fridge and the shiny surface on the wall is creating them. Also, there is a third and forth "orb" which indicates that if it's not a lens flare they are dust particles close to the lens. Those aren't orbs ^_^

<section>
Heather, lens flares are caused by light glaring into the lens and bouncing around in and around the glass and mirrors and lens etc., not by things being on the lens. As for dust, it could have been small specks of dust barely in front of the lens. Those things float around all the time. Take another look at the full picture. Notice the huge glares off of your fridge and the far wall? Those most likely caused the flares.
<br>
<br>
On top of that, they look like typical out-of-focus dust bits or lens flares. Too blurry to tell but still very typical.

Not orbs.  Based on symetry with the flares from the center of the frame.
<br>
<br>
I've taken a LOT of photographs in my life.  Compound lenses can cause some interesting effects, especially with a flash involved.  This is 100 times more apparent on digital camers, they don't handle dynamic light levels well (unless you got $5000 US).
<br>
<br>
You get the same problems with bare bulbs in the picture.

Well, damnit I wanted them to be orbs!! lol Honestly, we've had so many strange things happen, and hear noises, foot steps, etc. that when I uploaded the picture to my computer and saw the "orbs" I was like "Oh! Ok, now I get it!" lol
<br>
<br>
I have tried taking pictures in other areas of the house, however, I just took those pictures last night, so I haven't had much time, or luck. I am wondering if maybe its my kitty! lol I also sent the pictures to some haunting experts and they said pretty much the same thing as you, that the pictures weren't proof b/c of all the reflective surfaces. I understand that, I really do. We have just had some STRANGE things happen, and it seems to follow us no matter WHERE we go! For me, this is the 6th move in 2 1/2 years, and the most recent 3 moves, which have all been with my husband, there have been strange occurences, and just creepy vibes in general.
<br>
<br>
A friend brought up the point that since both my husband and I have "felt" the sensations in all of our houses and suspected that all 3 houses were haunted, that maybe we have something following us? I don't know what the possibilities are, I'm sure they're endless, just like with every other aspect of life.
<br>
<br>
So I guess the next step is take some pictures w/o any reflective surfaces around, any tips that could bring out the suspected orbs? Like, is there anything I can put out or do to attract them, or is there a better site to get this information from?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help SO much! This post is letting me attatch, so I will attatch the actual pictures also.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!!
<br>

That doesn't sound like hauntings.  That sounds like something else entirely.  Email me if you want some help with whatever it is.

<section>
Well, if you are having hauntings, maybe it would be a good idea to keep taking pictures.  I've heard a lot that such things have shown up on film.  I agree with the others, though, when I say that's probably not the case here.
<br>
It's easy to jump to conclusions, but I think it's best for everyone (ESPECIALLY people in this forum) to be skeptical about everything.  It's when we jump to premature conclusions that the scientific community uses our lack of discrimination as proof that ghosts/obe/psychic experiences don't exist.
<br>
My advice is that you just keep snapping pictures around the house (the most "active" or whatever) places and don't rest until you've got the pic of a lifetime.  Good luck.

<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not one for wanting to pour cold water on someone's fire, but I feel sensations, to one degree or another, in virtually every house I go in. It's very common and does not necessarily mean the houses are "haunted". There are people and all kinds of wildlife that attach themselves to buildings for all manner of reasons. Plus even new houses can get latched onto very quickly due to the land being so old.

Heather, first I would be interested in seeing the closeup before you lightened it. Second, odds are fair to good your orbs are dust particles -- they don't look like glare to me, but I'm no expert.
<br>
<br>
At RB's Montana workshop we went to a cave and did some meditation there. One person took pictures that show what I believe are actual orbs (which still doesn't explain what they
<u>
 are
</u>
, just shows they exist). She was at one end of the chamber and I was at the other. While meditating, with my eyes open, I could see the orbs toward her end of the cave. They varied in size. The smaller ones moved pretty quickly while the larger ones moved slowly. WHen I closed my eyes I could no longer see them, so whatever they are, they are physical, not mental. Some other folks could see them and some could not. The reason for this could be where they were sitting. I have a clear view down the length of the chamber while some were sitting behind outcrops. I tried copying over a picture of those orbs,along with a picture of confirmed dust particles, but it didn't work. I'll try it again later if you're interested.
<br>
<br>
Bottom line, you should be able to physically see genuine orbs, but that doesn't mean they are (or are not) spirits. They are just something we don't know about yet.

Take a look at some of the photos that were taken at my home by South Florida paranormal.  The two large ones in the back yard have been photographed several times traveling together throughout the yard.  They have definate structure and sometimes change in color.  I am only learning about ORBS because for some reason they want me to notice them.  Most real ones have a internal cell structure and external energy ring.

With multiple dimensions being layered on top of one another, I would say there are orbs around us all the time, whether you catch them on camera or not.

One night I tried this and took a bunch of pics in my apartment and found many of them. I'm skeptical but some things make me wonder.
<br>
<br>
1: when I take these pics the orbs seem to disapear after a few pictures. For instance if these were beings they didn't like their picture taken and left the scene.
<br>
<br>
2: I set my camera up on top of a speaker and snapped 3 quick shots after another and you could see something move across with a tail.
<br>
<br>
Damn just checked and looks like I deleted them awhile back...had them on my pc for 2 years. I'll have to try it again and see what comes up.

Actually the only reason I decided to take a pic was because I just bought a new digi cam a week prior. One night I had a feeling I wasnt alone and started snapping with the lights off and flash on and cought all kinds of weird things.  A few really gave me the creeps....but now that i have my camera again i'm gonna see what comes up and posts my pics and maybe we can figure out if it's a camera malfunction or other.

Hi
<br>
<br>
First of I would like to say... I like your cat! Lol
<br>
<br>
Now, good entitys like Classical music and art. The bad ones can't stand it. It is possible there is a spirit trapped in your house, but it is unlikely because of how many main water lines and such. They can not cross a water main or a hose. [
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
] And I suggest getting the book called Practical Psychic Self Defense. It is by Robert Bruce. As long as these spirits are not piggy backing on you, if they were there could be lots more problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OR maybe your guides just want to help your out? [

<section>
even though most likely they arent orbs is that what the look like?
<br>
fore .....(sorry im gonna drift off into story)
<br>
my room is is very dark with a heavy blue indigo paint on my walls and its at the end of a hall way so anyways the hallway light is on (not my room light) and i walk in my room and almost the very second i past my doors i see these blue orbs fly away and their not bright like produce light to read by or see anything better just blue so like i said they just fly away through the walls or anything and dissapear before i turn on the lights. weird
<br>
now i know you might be thinking its probably just the hallway lights glare on my eyes then i get the little glary sopots on my eyes because this is differnt then that. because i only get it in my room or if im at someones house for a while their there where i see sleep but my friends dont see it. so i have to ask even though this is probably off subject is this a spirit or something.

Some of the best ORBS that I have photographed at my home is when I prepair the camera before opening a closed door and take the photo right away.  Sometimes I get six or seven.  Then most times standing in the same spot I can take several more photos and they appear to be gone or I will get one in motion.  My daughter was at my home a few weeks ago on vacation and there was one that kept getting into the pictures when I would take a photo of her and her son.  I had to keep deleting and retaking photos.  I was also thinking that these things could possibly be created my electrometric energy from the power to my house.  But I have been told that actually then seem to feed off power.  Last week during hurricane Francis I lost power to my house and also the entire neighborhood.  This was an opportunity I had been waiting for.  I was still capturing the ORBS without electrical power to the house. As to there intelligence they will allow me to photograph them if I ask.  I don't think they really care if they get photographed and support some type evidence to there existence.  Who cares it seems.  People have been photographing UFO'S for years and still people doubt there existence. I suppose I am lucky in a way that not only can I practice OBE but I have the ORB phenomenon also.I have heard for hundreds of years these ORBS were also the so called Fairies.  Alo there is a relegious painting I found one time on the internet called "The adoration of the lamb'".  It is a ORB that was drawn hundreds of years ago. The researchers seem to believe that I actially have a portal at my home that acts as a passage way from the spirit world to ours.

First off, thank you to whoever it was that said they like my cat
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
He's my baby, his name is also baby lol
<br>
<br>
To whoever said I am worried about this, I am not worried in the least! I just have always thought orbs were fascinating, and found it even more so that they would be in my house!
<br>
<br>
Also, to whoever said they'd like to see the picture b4 it was lightened up... I don't thinkI have the original any more, but I will check and post again if I find it.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the overwhelming response!!
<br>
