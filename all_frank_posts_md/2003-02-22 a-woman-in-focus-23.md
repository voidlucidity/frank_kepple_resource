<section>
Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Went to the 3D blackness with the intent to assist in a retrieval with Helpers wherever needed. Just kinda floated there for awhile, enjoying how that area seems to calm me, and when I started to feel as if I was going to doze off I decided to get to work. I watched the blackness carefully and then spotted a sparkly area almost directly ahead, focused in on it....and I was instantly in a whiter area. No other info was forthcoming so I paused, feeling that perhaps I just needed to adjust to the instantaneous change of locale.
<br>
<br>
I then sensed a female voice cry out, "Let me out of here! Someone let me out of here!" Off to my left I sensed a large, square shaped structure and got there were vertical bars comprising the side facing me. I moved closer as she repeated her frantic screaming and the scene opened up more, allowing me to realize I seemed to be in a dungeon of sorts, made of stone, dark...and she was gripping the bars, trying to shake them lose. I immediately said hello and that I was there to help her leave. She wasn't in good shape. I caught a glimpse of dark fingers, bone thin brown arms. The cell she was in must have been eight by eight feet and she squatted down, moving back into a black corner when she became aware of me. She kept pleading, crying she wanted out and I told her she had to calm down, to be quiet for just a moment so we didn't attract attention. I told her my name and she said hers was something that sounded like, Ah-zsaong. She repeated it, including what I guess was her last name, and I can't remember it now.
<br>
<br>
I then knew there were keys hanging nearby to unlock her cell door and as I grabbed them, quickly deciding which key fit the iron lock, I briefly wondered why I was going through the motions of using a key...having to unlock her prison door. As I turned the key and watched the door open I got the answer: if I did anything else, such as just 'see the door not there', or intend something that would be quick and logical from my perspective, it all very well could be perceived on her end as magic, or cause her to become anxious or doubt me.....which would have increased her level of fear. She didn't move, cowering in the darkness, and I realized she had no clothing on. I took some kind of shawl or long cloth from my shoulders and draped it around her, noting she was extremely thin, undernourished. I asked in a low voice how she came to be here and I was then experiencing a rote, I guess from her. Romans had invaded her village, most of her family had been killed, and she was now in this cell waiting for a door at the opposite end to open and be met with the kind of death most couldn't image. I felt a bit shocked when it came to me that she was considered sub-human, or an animal, and that at any moment she would be forced out through the opposite end to meet with---what?--hungry lions? It then felt as if there was an arena of sorts on the other side, and she was a part of a savage spectator sport. She placed her left hand on her head and began crying as she thought of her family.
<br>
<br>
I felt Helpers behind me and told her we could leave now. A woman approached the cell door, offering clothing, which she and a second female Helper then took a few seconds to drape and arrange properly over Ah-zsaong's body, making sure her head and most of her face were covered. As we began walking along a stone corridor I thought I perceived noises or other voices crying out and asked one of the Helpers if we were in the BST. She shook her head, saying I was just picking up on manifestations of Ah-zsaong's isolated world. I stopped, watching them disappear into a white area and the Helper glanced back at me and slowed, extending her left hand to indicate I could travel with them if I wanted. I caught up with her, grabbed her hand and moved with the other women for a time. I was told Ah-zsaong would be in a hospital setting for awhile, a place that would match her expectations.
<br>
<br>
When it was time to go I thanked the Helper and headed back to the 3D blackness....floated around for awhile and eventually returned to C1.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening and much love to all,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

Thanks Ginny for sharing your experience!  I love to read your retrieval posts.  I hope in the future I will be "astrally-advanced" enough to take part in one as well. [

Hi Ep,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your kind words. In all honesty, I really don't consider myself all that advanced in afterlife exploration. Always working with Helpers has taught me a great deal but there's still so much to learn. But hey...just more to look forward to---;o).
<br>
<br>
Take care and will enjoy reading your adventures in the future.

Love,

<section>
So just out of curiosity [
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
] why dont these helpers do the retrievals themselves, why do they wait for somone to come along to focus 23 and do it for them and then take over afterwards?
<br>
None of it makes any sense to me. [|)]
<br>
<br>
Why dont these people who are trapped in their nightmares so to speak get help straight away? Its as though they've been trapped in these nightmares for a long long time and only get help when people go to focus 23. Its as though there are thousands of souls trapped with no-one to help them until someone on the physical plane goes to focus 23.

<section>
Ginny or someone correct me if I'm wrong...
<br>
<br>
I think what happens is they actually don't see the Helpers, or if they do, they think they're someone or something trying to hurt them because I think they look different than someone in the physical.
<br>
<br>
These people die and don't know it, and are stuck in whatever situation their mind puts them in. (usually the place/situation where they died in the physical)  They don't think anything is wrong with where they are and don't really grasp that they could've been there for a long time already.  I think Ginny or someone else who did a retrieval mentioned that one lady kept thinking that people kept coming to rob her, so she put up a wall of kitchen items (that was where she was stuck) and the retriever had to convince the lady to come out and that she wasn't being robbed.  In the end if I remember correctly the retriever figured out that the "robbers" were really the Helpers trying to come and help, but the person (victim) wouldn't acknowledge them.
<br>
<br>
Like I said, this is just how I've interpreted the situation after reading a couple retrieval posts.  Someone more experienced in this could probably correct me on a lot of things.

 Hi Hephaestus,
 <br>
 <br>
 Focus 23 is a label Robert Monroe gave to a specific area of consciousness, or an area within the afterlife, he encountered in his OOB travels many years ago. Almost always the people there are isolated and stuck in a scenario of their own creation, due to several reasons, some being: beliefs held while in the physical pertaining to not believing in any life/awareness beyond physical death; comatose or sudden death creating confusion; fear, guilt or other emotions/desires people hang onto and so on.
 <br>
 <br>
 Beliefs have incredible power. If a person stuck in Focus 23 *believes they're still alive in the physical*, they tend to be completely unaware of anyone around them who currently resides in the nonphysical, such as Helpers, deceased family members, personal Guides. When a retriever comes along there's something about their energetic makeup that a stuck person can perceive, because the retriever has an energetic quality about them that says/feels like, 'a part of me is still focused in physical reality'....and it's that energetic physicality that stuck persons will notice or pay attention to---*only because of their own beliefs*, not because retrievers are special or Helpers are incapable.  I've been to many retrievals where deceased family members and Helpers had tried over and over to simply get a stuck person's attention, to get them to simply become aware of them, so they could be helped and moved out of their isolation. All a retriever need do is befriend the stuck person and help them to become aware of others who can assist them. I never decide where they should go or what's best for them once they become aware of a Helper.
 <br>
 <br>
 Much love,
 <br>

 Ginny

 Hi Ep,
 <br>
 <br>
 Yep, you're right on it. It's all about the power beliefs carry, how our strongly held beliefs create. From what I've been able to gather retrieving has been going on as long as human consciousness has been here. And I feel we've all had experience with it at one time or another, whether we're consciously aware of it or not is another matter.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another retriever who visited one of many alcoholic worlds within the BST (Belief System Territories---Focus 24-26) reported back that a man there had for quite some time perceived bright lights hanging around but they scared him. He had no idea they were Helpers. Interesting to see from his perspective what others not affiliated with that BST world appeared like.
 <br>

 Much love Ep,

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
Yes, a lot. Makes you wonder if there's something safe or familiar about being surrounded by walls or small confining places. For instance, when starting to explore the afterlife and confronted with all that immense afterlife 'space whatever', I immediately created my F27 place. The afterlife was an unknown to me then and I can see why the need to be surrounded with at least that which is familiar is created....(lol).
<br>
<br>
Frank...are you talking about encountering people in cells (with bars) such as what Ah-zsaong was in, or just small enlosures in general?
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

Yes, a great deal of the time. Remember the post involving what I labeled the Cubicle Hell in the BST--people lying in stacked, tiny rectangular spaces? That entire experience was confusing and only created a ton of questions for me, and in returning later was told that that area was actually the 'back door' to that hell, meaning those individuals were trying to move away from the strong energy of that hell, distance themselves as best they could...and the cubicles offered some measure of privacy.
<br>
<br>
All very interesting...and serves to make me want to go back.

You said :

"She kept pleading, crying she wanted out and I told her she had to calm down, to be quiet for just a moment so we didn't attract attention. "

Were you aware of others in the vicinity, e.g. her percieved "captors", who you were trying to avoid ?

Hi Mark,
<br>
<br>
No. At that moment a part of me was wondering why I was telling her to quiet down (and I did briefly sort of open up more to her surroundings to see if I could detect others nearby) but I just allowed myself to play along within her world, for the sake of helping her out. Same with instantly knowing there were keys hanging nearby, to unlock her cell door...or removing a shawl from my shoulders to give to her (I don't wear shawls...lol). It's important to play along for their sake, just til they've become aware of others who can help them on their way.
<br>
<br>
In the beginning of retrieving, Mark, the retrieval situations were conducted more slowly, for my benefit I'm sure (Helpers are great tutors). Nowadays info comes in fast or things just happen and it's really quite easy to just go along for the ride, so to speak. I'm not sure whether Helpers are feeding this info to me or a larger part of me, connected to the huge consciousness we're all a part of, enables me to just know stuff. Still so much to learn---:o)
<br>
<br>
Much love and thanks,
<br>

Hi Ginny !
<br>
<br>
I was thinking that perhaps your intuition to speak quietly with the woman in the cell was due to the signals you were getting from her, and the environment she had created for herself, other than external things like other astral beings.
<br>
<br>
Have you ever been in any retrieval-type situations where there have been other people around....e.g. more than one person to help, or maybe people interfering when you are in the middle of a retrieval ?  Or are they normally "straightforward"?! hee hee. Just curious,
<br>

<br>
Mark,
<br>
<br>
You know, you're probably right. Perhaps while in the afterlife we're more in touch with or able to more naturally access what we call 'intuition'. In thinking this over I remembered wanting to calm her down for her sake, so she'd be able to listen to me. Her hysteria was taking center stage and getting worse after she became aware of me.
<br>
<br>
Sure, the BST (Belief System Territories...Focus levels 24-26) are where you find people who are usually not isolated as they are in Focus 23. These territories have been created by strong beliefs held by many and are usually populated by a great number of folks. And I've been in retrieval situations there where yes, others tried to interfer with a member wanting to leave (people living there). I had one leader (political leader if you can believe that!) who was angry he was losing a convert. I've had religious people stare, glare and one minister stand before a pulpit and single me out, declaring me a heretic. These have been far and few between (perhaps I'm a chicken and don't like controversy?...lol). In several cases I made myself blend in with the community (clothing, mannerisms etc) in order to avoid conflict and just help the person out who'd been broadcasting a desire to leave. In usually relying on Helpers to decide which BST world we go to, for retrieval purposes, what I've found is we usually go to what's known as 'a back door' of any given world, meaning some people there have been moving further and further away from the beliefs/energy of said world, towards the outer edge (back door), desiring to leave for whatever reasons._
<br>
<br>
I've also participated in what's called PEs, Partnered Explorations...where another retriever and I agreed to meet at a certain afterlife location to assist in retrieval situations. Usually proves to be a great way to verify info, to validate stuff, and of course to help others.
<br>
<br>
Hey Mark, I don't mind the questions at all...and hope I answered this one---:o)
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>
<br>
Ginny
