I don't want to sound cranky, but have you tried a search? This question is asked quite a bit.
<br>
<br>
The overwhelming answer is "no," but allowing leeway for the possibility of being mentally or emotionally hurt.
<br>
<br>
Just a few nights ago I had a semi-lucid dream where someone attached a bomb to my teeth. It exploded. But I'm alright.

Lucky for you, this is a forum, not a chat room. So, your topic will

 always

be here (barring any malfunctions or the discretion of the mods).

I have a question relevant to this. Is the astral body eternal? If someone, say tries to kill you in the astral plane what would happen?

and to your question alexd i myselfe have never actually ap'd before so am not actually 100% sure on this but from what i can figure out id have to say no since you dont actually have a physical body to harm but i suppose theres allways the possability of that but again im not really to sure about these things

It seems like the consensus to that first question is "yes," and I tend to agree. As for the second, every time that I have been killed in astral/lucid dreams, one of two things happens. 1) I feel as if I "hit bottom," that things are "over," and it's "the end," and I wake up. 2) The experience warps and changes to become something different, maybe even more vivid one.
<br>
<br>
Number one is way more likely if I've fallen some distance, and number two is more likely if... I don't know, someone bludgeons me in the face or something. [

or if someone attaches a bomb to your teeth] So, swim at your own risk. ;)

Is this a serious question?
<br>
<br>
I mean, people spend ages and ages just to have one fleeting obe every now and again, and here you are wondering what will happen if you stay in that state too long. I think a lot of people here would dearly love to have that luxury of obe-ing too long, and with too much awareness too, lol.

When I was thinking about it I was actually pondering what would happen after physical death. After physical death it is likely that we go to the astral plane, and if we die there obviously there is nowhere to wake up to. Thanks for your replies.
