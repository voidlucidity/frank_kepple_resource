Is Focus 3 malleable like Focus 2? For example, if I get to The Park then start fearing negs, will the nasty little critters be created?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Once of the most fantastic qualities of Focus 3 of consciousness is that people immediately gravitate to those sections that most fit their particular expectations about their experience. So all the people who expect to go to hell actually do. All the people who expect to go to heaven go to heaven and many, many other situations besides. You simply gravitate towards what you believe will come about.
<br>
<br>
Focus 3 is an area of common consensus reality so everything within that reality is, by definition, created in a joint sense. Whereas Focus 2 is an individual consensus reality. If you are projecting and you begin getting fearful then you will typically have multiple Focus 2 overlay experiences about whatever it is you are fearful about. You mention "negs" but I'm not exactly sure what "negs" are, as I do not subscribe to that belief construct.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

You've answered my question, Frank--thank you.
<br>
<br>
More or less it seems that the answer is "yes", but in perhaps a different way than might work in Focus 2.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
