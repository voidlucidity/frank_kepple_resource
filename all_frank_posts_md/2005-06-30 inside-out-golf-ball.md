Umm...I've had another funky overlay experience, was wondering if this is the famous fz? It basically looked like and inside-out golf ball. When I say golf ball, there were points of light at equidistant positions, kinda like the dimples on said golf ball. I thought it looked rather cool!

With me it feels literally like I am floating in space and all around are stars. I am not literally in space, i.e. in the "real time zone" but that is what it looks like.

Major Tom:
<br>
<br>
I take your point but do you not think there is a MAJOR contradiction with this "edge of the physical system" idea at focus 21? I mean, how can it be? No criticism aimed at you personally as you are merely quoting the norm I realise.
<br>
<br>
Focus 15 is meant to be an area of "no time". So the physical must "end" before focus 15. It is illogical to have a pinpoint area of "no time". So you have time, then no-time, and then time again. It's something that never, ever sat right with me and does not concur with my experience.
<br>

MT:

<br>
According to Monroe he is perfectly clear and states that the first area he "enters" after phasing away from the physical is his "mainframe" his own individual area of mind in other words. This accords perfectly with my experience. I think Monroe just considered his own mind to be part of the "time/space" arena. And then anything beyond his "hole in the wall" was outside of that.
