Hi,
<br>
<br>
Its nice to be back on this forum. I am wondering if anyone has witnessed this or has come to the same conclusions as me.
<br>
Would you be so kind to read my link......

If you go into the golden light, what'll happen?  Do you "merge" with the "source"?

However, the Golden light is an alternative and you probably wont reincarnate but this subject goes even deeper than the colours of these lights.

You say we are a slave race. To whom are we slaves to?
<br>
What motivation do the beings to whom we are slaves to have?
<br>
What do they gain from us reincarnating here?
<br>
<br>
As those beings have designed the "soul catcher", they know about the possibility to merge with the source. Why do they not merge with the source?
<br>
<br>
I hope you don't misunderstand this form of "interrogaton" as an attack, I just try to know more about your theory.

Merging with the source = ultimate destruction.

I think that idea of being slaves is silly too. I am free now and enjoy this, escaping from existence by merging with source is an act of extreme weakness...

If you merge with the source you'll become one with it, resulting in losing _your_ "true" consciousness. There will only be one sort of consciousness in the end, the one of the source.

<br>
The source consciousness doesn't seem to care about us, otherwise it would interfere, wouldn't it? Or is a completely balanced consciousness without all forms of polarity a passive consciousness which cannot act at all?

Veccolo,
<br>
<br>
Yes it is basically a game of 'Polarities'-Positive and Negative.
<br>
<br>
You see at grass roots level a Human being is from the Positive polarity but our pure consciousness is pure balance.However, we need the negative to exist in the dimensions.
<br>
<br>
If you look at the structure of an atom it is mostly empty space but HAS polarities. Everything in our Universe has poles, from Planets down to Atoms.

Gman, i too have read david ickes books and ive read about this white light trick ure talking about, in matrix5 but I am sceptical. From what I understand, there is a white and a golden light, and the white one is meant to trick us?  So does that mean that we wouldn't  reincarnate if we went to the golden light?

I must disagree, they ARE manifestations of the source. Everything is from the source because the source is all there is, they cannot be from anywhere else. And yes they do exist in polarity based realities, which also are manifestations of the source, and feed off fear but this doesn't make them not part of the source.
<br>
<br>
And as far as polarity goes, it only exists on the lower planes, because really they are two sides of the same coin so they are really the same but appearing to be different.

<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no higher or lower in consciousness. Consciousness just is. There are no higher or lower planes, and there are no higher or lower selves. If we were to talk for a moment in terms of higher and lower, hypothetically speaking let's say, all of us are our "highest" expression of self already. There is no higher expression of ourselves than ourselves, lol.
<br>
<br>
No one manipulates us via possession or otherwise. World Leaders create their reality just as we do. The crux of the "problem" is most people do not realise that we all are the very definition of a walking, talking self-fulfilling prophecy.

Even to this day when we speak of our Multidimensional existence to 'Grounded' and misinformed people, we are laughed at and called strange or weird.

I know as you do Major that it is a Personal journey and to master Astral Travel is a Godsend for personal evolution.
<br>
Then why is it that you condemn my opinions. I feel that practitioners of Astral Projection should be taking our knowledge to the next level. I feel we are going round in circles and it is no different now that the early Victorian spiritual mediums etc.

It is not about to manipulate. The golden light is about spiritual evolution, it is about new spiritual concept every time and self consciousness taking those new concepts into own life and using them to create own world. Having incorporated more of this light into self consciousness gives the ability to become aware of the path of those who are waking behind us, so the art of manipulation comes to issue.  But this is something which is part of a small  portion of the path, it's just a learning and nothing more.
<br>
<br>
Everything is about polarity, receiving light, and giving it to own world for learning and giving assistance to others; ...then you receive more light..
<br>
<br>
Gman, it may be easy to manipulate what you already know (be them situations, reality, threads, etc), but that is like entering into a labyrinth where you stop learning.

| Will be Reincarnated, some kind of trick

IF ENTER GOLD LIGHT THEN

So, who controls  WHITE LIGHT+explanation ?

So, who controls  GOLD LIGHT+explaintion?

How do you enter WHITE LIGHT/GOLD LIGHT in AP?  I thought

this is if you were actually "Dead" ?

<section>
You know it just never ends does it? Now we have to worry about falling into the trap of the white light, do we? People seriously, there is an INFINITY of things to worry about. It never ends. If you focus on such things, THAT is what will keep you from the Source. Do you honestly believe that by going into a gold light instead of a white one, your soul will be saved? Do you honestly believe that making such a decision proves that you have attained enough knowledge and wisdom that you no longer need to be subjected to reincarnation? What kind of idiot do you take God to be? I seriously think some people (many people) take God to be a moron.
<br>
<br>
If there is any reality that comes from this theory, it may be that when you do enter the gold light, it is because you've earned it. It would be because you have attained enough knowledge, growth, and insight that reincarnation no longer serves you. If you're still forced to reincarnate, there are obviously more lessons that you need to learn. And getting a tip from someone on a message board about which light to choose, I'm sorry, I tend to think that you need to achieve a bit more insight about the workings of the universe than that.

I'd rather go into white one and kick the bottoms of anyone who has set up this trap, then demolish everything there with a nuke and take over the throne of white light.

Let's try and take the experience for what it is. We're here now and perceiving things, even though it is a mind-created structure we just can't pierce it completely.
<br>
<br>
It's like when you know you're in a dream and dealing with materialized thoughts, but to transcend that would turn everything off.
<br>
<br>
So you're there on the verge of your life, and you happen to see 2 tunnels, one white and one golden, and you remember having read this, which one would you choose?
<br>
<br>
For the sake of exploration I guess I would consider taking the golden one.
<br>
<br>
One time in deep trance I saw my right arm bright golden, and the left arm pale white, I was attracted to the golden.

This reality is an illusion? ::yawn:: That concept is nothing new and has been around for thousands of years. David Icke's books, though interesting, are fiction.

All you have to do is try this for yourself... When you have your next O.B.E  go out side your house (in the RTZ) look up to the sky about 50 degrees from the horizon, concentrate on the golden light, look hard and it will appear.Enter the light and you will see that you cant put into words the amazing feeling of 'Going Home' back to the source of consciousness.

I have been there 4 times and I did not want to come back.

i ask all Genuine Astral Projectors to try this (not the wishful thinkers or beginners).

Interesting I wonder if you grow spiritually, maybe the concept of religion is just taken for what it is, just one explanation of why we are here.
<br>
Perhaps Astral Projection proves there is more to it than that, so no matter what religion you are or follow, AP shows that when you AP we are all the same? Hmmm... I not sure If I getting this across effectively!

<section>
Hi All,
<br>
<br>
My earlier posting was 'Slightly' wrong and I did a 7 day Astral journey to find out a bit more insight.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested, here goes...........
<br>
<br>
Hi,
<br>
<br>
My energy levels have took on a bit of a turn for the worse so I will be brief. I hope you will understand that I need proper 3D Physical rest and grounded thoughts. I will be grounding myself with work and day to day 'normal' things for a few days after this posting.
<br>
<br>
These are from my notes.
<br>
<br>
Day 1 : 2 AProjections
<br>
<br>
1.RTZ only, flew around the neighbourhood and visited a few friends.
<br>
2.RTZ only, Experimented with touch. Visited my brothers house and tried to tap his wife on the shoulder, it took a while before she turned around and looked shocked and scared. She later said that she felt cold on her left side, her muscles twiched and then she felt a prod. She called me every name under the sun Ha Ha!
<br>
<br>
Day 2: 0 AP
<br>
<br>
Hard day due to energy 'leakage' problem
<br>
<br>
Day 3 : 1AP
<br>
<br>
RTZ flew and teleportation to 'Dark Side' of Moon. HOLY FU**ING BAS*ARD JESUS CHRIST not a nice place , do not want to and will not speak of this, ALL OBErs please go there to experiance what is going on PLEASE. My hair is standing on end again.
<br>
<br>
Day 4 : 1 AP
<br>
<br>
RTZ the Moved into Astral to 'Akashic' Records. Learned many personal things about 'Probable' Future timelines (Theres me thinking that im ready to graduate, oh well).
<br>
<br>
Day 5 6 7 : 4 APs (easy Due to full Moon cycle)
<br>
<br>
Very very strong projections to high Astral and High Spirit dimensions. Learned many things personal and Global. I learned that my deepest fears were correct when I entered the 'Golden Light'. I found this out.....
<br>
<br>
The Golden light is the home of our 'Higher Self' or Aspect. It is not our final destination. I communicated with my Higher self an it told me this. "The so called 'Alien Abductees' including you, have come to the end of their experiment which their higher selves actually agreed to. Your Billion year old Implants were or are in the process of being removed as we speak (I confirm this as true as an experiance happened to me 1yr ago). Your Thoughts are now your own".
<br>
I then looked around this place of enormous love and Balance to see Trillions of points of lights all interconnected with one another. They had a kind of silver glass tubes coming out of the points of lights which when followed down they disappeared into a multicoloured sea of electrically charged vibrational energy (its hard to describe).
<br>
<br>
"Yes your part of the Game is now coming to an end. You still have experiences to go through but it will finally get easier for you. Your life has been mental torture but you agreed to this and now you will reap the benefits. Balance is the key but you cant acheive Balance without experiencing the Positive and Negative. You knew this deep down for many many years."
<br>
<br>
I was told many things which are personal to me, but the "Game is coming to an end" for me made me smile and jump around. Who knows, It might mean that I may 'Die' soon or actually evolve to a stage where I graduate or ascend (who knows only time will tell). I know im ready and I want to go Back Home.
<br>
<br>
All this info was from my perspective so please dont judge me.
<br>
<br>
I think if anyone else can get something from this is that the 'Matrix' has many, many more sides and influences involved in the 'Game of Life', more than I could ever possibly imagine. I thought I had a grip on this but I was wrong, I feel like a kid again, a small kid in a Big World.

with as far and wide as we've become, doesn't it just make it easier for quack bot Christians to look at all of this and think  "Antichrist" .
<br>
<br>
I've had a heavy load of very soul deteriorating supernatural experiences in this so called incarnation, which i could but won't get into unless anyone cares. not that anyone cares anymore about anything but the elite of the genre you participate in. (be it astral forums or football cornbread) .
<br>
<br>
I've been psychically attacked by a dweller on the threshold alien with burning red eyes, simply tore through the dream and merged my two worlds of my bedroom and the dream.k
<br>
<br>
I've also had a complete imbalance of what it is to connect to souls and i think it had something to do with all my Charis either completely shutting out or reversing.k I'm not sure for sure what it all is. The physical effect of the former was a perception Lag Mode as I call it, so try to imagine every single piece of time and space, every perception, is suddenly felt as a huge sinking feeling, your visual perception sinks to choppy frame by frame waving.
<br>
<br>
On a purely physical aspect, I've witnessed a UFO, two giant white (propulsion) lights on some-thing in the air, much bigger then a plane, much closer, slowly hovering, and not until I saw it, my girlfriend saw it, and my friend all saw it did it decide to speed off into hyperspace.
<br>
<br>
Another thing to mention is Ive never been able to have a conscious OBE, BUT i have had strange OBE awareness experiences through dreams and simply through the memories i have of such experiences, yea, i just have the memories of being me and being somewhere else.  I think there's something in the whole collective consciousness and reflecting lower astral world, and do somewhat fear but look forward to this inevitable change.
<br>
Through my life, Ive never been able to accustom myself to this weird idea of incarnation existence.  Ive always played with the life i was dealt behind closed doors, by that, i mean i was a over -bipolar-compulsive- dreamer.  The Lag Mode I spoke of also effects my younger sister, and i believe it is some kind of loosening of my acceptance of the hologram, i see around it perhaps.
<br>
<br>
In any case, The past 6 moths of my life i have not been comfortable on this world at all and the only fun i have is in the dreams i sometimes remember, nothing fancy, just the escape from this weird social mutant we can thank for ruining me.  I have come to believe i know what i should have been if i were comfortable with myself around others and not been such a lone driven reality and it hurts to know i cannot have that not.  i wanted to start over because now I've lost my best friends who somehow i connected with, but i fell out of that last loop too, no one is close to me and i think i am really looking forward to this end game part of our existence, change needs to happen NOW
<br>
<br>
is there any hope at all for turn around, crystals, are they part of this illusion deception too, they are after all the great metaphysical substance of the physical, and i achieved a short and mostly intense awareness beyond of 100x lag mode i with a large quartz once, got scared. and eventually for whatever reason, ended up shattering the entire thing, probably wasn't a good idea, or was it.
<br>
<br>
And about that realization about what i feel i was meant to be, the trick was to be constantly animated, just like you are when you get carried away looking at yourself and talking and making faces in that bathroom or end up dancing around your house, the stuff you don't do around other people, i don't DO anything around anyone and I've lost myself.

Has anyone read 'The Precious Treasury on the Basic Phenomena of Space' by Longchen Rabjam?

Just curious as to what people might think about that.

David Icke is one of the cleverest and simultaneously stupid people I am aware of on the planet at this current moment, let us refer to him as 'Jibble' for ever more.

<section>
I haven't read the whole thread, but have noticed the references to David Icke.
<br>
<br>
Some few years ago he changed his job as a sports broadcaster here in the UK and announced that he was the Second Coming of Christ - yes the
<i>
 Son of God
</i>
.  No joke, the Son of God (his words).  He said that he was as surprised as anybody to discover that he was the Son of God but basically, it's a job that was lined up and somebody had to do it, and boy yes he was shocked, but it happend to be him!
<br>
<br>
He didn't get very far with this and (very) quickly disappeared from public view.  That was the end of his broadcasting career too.
<br>
<br>
As far as I am aware David Icke never cured the incurable, never breathed life into the dead, and never performed any miracles of any sort whatsoever.  He is aging and greying nicely with the rest of us mortals.
<br>
<br>
The last I heard about him recently was his new conspiracy theory that the UK Royal Family were shape-shifting lizards.  Behind closed doors they change back from human form to reptile.  Well if your career is ripped to ribbons, you discover after all that you aren't actually the Son of God and you can't feed yourself for 5000 days on a couple of fish and a few loaves, then you write a few books.
<br>
<br>
I'll leave it up to the board members to decide upon this man's sanity/sincerity, but for myself I shalln't waste a single penny, cent or euro on any of his books....!

I agree that David Icke is somewhat of a nutjob, but his references to reptilians are very real.  They do exist and they do control Earth, nothing we can do about it though.
<br>
<br>
The white light trap is real, when you die, and if you do see a white light, do not go toward the light.  It may reel you in with images of someone familiar in your life you were close to.
<br>
<br>
As for the golden light?  Ive never heard of it, and as far as I know might be another trick.  But im not sure on that.

it seems your intentions are good

but what you and others on that site post
<br>
remains flawed
<br>
confused
<br>
misconstrued
<br>
and injurious to some
<br>
<br>
upon death
<br>
we don't do the sorting completely alone
<br>
there are 7 paths i have seen so far
<br>
all of these paths were reached by going into the white light tunnel
<br>
<br>
to 7 gates of death
<br>
4 main ones :judgement healing love and truth
<br>
5 above golden light
<br>
6 below the damned ones who will get more chances to change while there
<br>
7 missing the train wandering souls often unaware of own demise
<br>
it does not seem that any gate is an ultimate destination
<br>
just a next step
<br>
<br>
to escape reincarnation is not done by mere choice
<br>
to go to golden light
<br>
gee that would be easy
<br>
and what would be the point ?
<br>
do you want to win the game
<br>
or merely quit it ?
<br>
<br>
and we did not see anyone going to the golden light
<br>
when my circle was taken there for instruction
<br>
the golden light was elohim council and higher realms
<br>
which we can go to in the body as visitors now
<br>
but the dead spirit dont seem to be allowed there
<br>
upon initial entry anyway
<br>
the best gate was TRUTH
<br>
it was the gate of no unanswered questions
<br>
no unfinished business or sorrows or huge karma
<br>
the gate of i know where i am going and where i have been
<br>
and what i want to do next ...awareness
<br>
<br>
I plan on coming back and setting the stage for the next life
<br>
so that i can learn faster and more and share more teach more
<br>
<br>
if you continue to preach walk away from the white light
<br>
you might actually succeed in winning some converts
<br>
who then will roam around aimlessly waiting for a rescue of lost souls
<br>
they will not go anywhere else
<br>
<br>
to go up thru the white light is to be part of the process
<br>
to help decide what the next step is
<br>
it is not a trap
<br>
your words are illusion
<br>
which promote fear not faith
<br>
in God's plan
<br>
and being a servant is a path to growth not being a slave
<br>
the highest are seeker servant warrior wise ones
<br>
<br>
<br>
avoiding the white light means choosing to be an earthbound spirit
<br>
<br>
go to the source see for yourself
<br>
before you spread gobbledygook
<br>
which some might believe
<br>
and find misfortune in
<br>
there are many paths
<br>
all are valid
<br>
and lead to God
<br>
eventually
<br>
but
<br>
first do no harm

Hmm.  There's something a
<i>
 little
</i>
similar to this in various types of Bardo practice in Buddhism.  In it, one is supposed to recognize the clear light of awareness when they die, and thus pass over into enlightenment.  However, it requires quite a bit of preparation during the dying period, and generally a high level of spiritual attainment.  Just looking for a different color of light wouldn't work.  I don't know if the clear light of awareness is the same as the golden light, but I suppose the idea could be a distant echo.

I don't agree with you.
<br>
<br>
Life is not horrible, and if you feel so sure that it is then that's just what you believe. Before you condemn me a materialist...like you have already stated in the link you initially posted if someone argues your theory, I should tell you that I am a very, very old soul. Not only have I had two near death experiences in this life I have seen the white light and walked into it, there I learned more about my true self.
<br>
I am here for a reason, I could have died but I chose to come back. And since age three, I have known about my past lives. I now know that I am the one who is in charge of my fate, that as a soul I am independent. You cannot tell me or anyone else the reason we are here. I'm not here for the same reason as you, I am certain. I am a wanderer and I have a mission.
<br>
I have never lived past the age of twenty because of the same disease...that now can be survived. I am unhealthy and riddled with disease, what fortune! Still, I see that life is not miserable like you have proposed to these people.
<br>
<br>
I know that to you these are all just statements. But you must be told...that I have chosen to be reincarnated. I am no slave.

I read the link to that post on the other forum. Funny thing is, when I was 17 years old, someone told me something very similar. I do not take this as truth, or fiction, I do not know the truth. This is basically what he said:
<br>
<br>
When you die, you go into the 'Astral plane'. This place is suppose to be a transition point, where you go to your next 'existance/life', and there are many many different types of existance. If you go into the white light, you might get a suprise, according to this person I spoke with. There are beings, very old beings, whom the person refered to as the "eaters of souls' on this plane. I do not remember all the details but I will do my best.
<br>
Basically these beings feed off whatever energy you are composed of when on the astral. You are NOT suppose to linger on the astral plane for a long time, but for some unknown reason, these beings have chosen to. If you DO reside there, eventually, you will not be able to keep your form and sustain yourself, as there is no food/energy there for you. The 'eaters of souls' have found a way to stay. They trick you into comming to them, through images of God, peaceful 'feelings', and yes, a white light. Moth to the flame eh? This person discribed how they keep you with them as they feed off of your energy as a parallel to a drug like heroin, of course there are NO physical type drugs in the astral, he said it is some kind of spiritual energy/thing that makes you feel peaceful, and happy, and these beings use it like a drug to keep you with them...as your energy is being sucked out and finnaly you cease to exist, which would be THEIR fate if they didnt have this energy.
<br>
Why do they stay in the astral? Who knows, they will not leave. They have become insane, mad. You may stay on the astral and take others energy, however your 'mind' will fail you, you will become mad. So these beings are mad gods, astral vampires if you will.
<br>
This person likened them to a wheel, with the beings in the center, and you along the spokes. He said there are a few of these wheels out there.
<br>
The good news (If this is real or not, I havent thought of this for ages, just remembered when I saw this thread)... is that there are guides on the other side, waiting to help recently departed. There are also schizophrenic type spirits, confused, wandering around, unable to comprehend where they are, that will not listen to anyone, and may lead you astray. Come to think about it, what if this IS true? Maybe as security I should find a spirit guide now...

I have to agree with catmeow.... Anyone from the UK who remembers his blinding transition from coventry goalkeeper (i think) to "son of god", will still be amazed at the amount of money he is earning through book sales.
<br>
<br>
Personally (!) I believe that his books are a "bit" of a scam. David Icke seems to me to be a classic lesson about how people's lives can be manipulated.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of my rants... Has anyone had any experience of the following ? If so, what did you experience ?

 Let's try and take the experience for what it is. We're here now and perceiving things, even though it is a mind-created structure we just can't pierce it completely.
 <br>
 <br>
 It's like when you know you're in a dream and dealing with materialized thoughts, but to transcend that would turn everything off.
 <br>
 <br>
 So you're there on the verge of your life, and you happen to see 2 tunnels, one white and one golden, and you remember having read this, which one would you choose?
 <br>
 <br>
 For the sake of exploration I guess I would consider taking the golden one.
 <br>
 <br>
 One time in deep trance I saw my right arm bright golden, and the left arm pale white, I was attracted to the golden.

 we don't do the sorting completely alone

 there are 7 paths i have seen so far
 <br>
 all of these paths were reached by going into the white light tunnel
 <br>
 <br>
 to 7 gates of death
 <br>
 4 main ones :judgement healing love and truth
 <br>
 5 above golden light
 <br>
 6 below the damned ones who will get more chances to change while there
 <br>
 7 missing the train wandering souls often unaware of own demise
 <br>
 it does not seem that any gate is an ultimate destination

 just a next step

This is the New Age Bull**it I was talking about.
<br>
<br>
You see, WE control the final outcome with our own personal mindset. For example If you believe that there are just 7 astral planes then thats what you will get.
<br>
You are as an awakened soul who unfortunately has been blinded by a particular 10% true belief system.

Ok so I'm a bit freaked out. Do I go to the white light and get reincarnated? or do I go into the Gold light and lose conciousness? What evr happened to being able to explore the different realms and planes of existence, now I have to be instantly reincarnated or merge with the source.
<br>
<br>
I'm a bit confused and probably dont know what I'm talking about so if someone could explain this too me in simple terms that would be appreciasted.
