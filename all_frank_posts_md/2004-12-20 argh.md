I can seem to get into the vibrational state fine, but I find it hard to keep breathing regularly. It seemed that the vibes only got stronger when I exhaled, and went away when I inhaled. I think I need some help with breathing patterns or to make breathing more involuntary.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
This is caused through tension in the muscles of your abdomen. Your yellow energy centre is coming alive and interacting with the crown (purple) which is giving you the vibrations. But muscular tension in the abdomen is thwarting the experience and causing the yellow-centre to shut down. As you exhale, you release the tension in the muscles. But on the inhale, it comes back again.
<br>
<br>
You should find that the longer and the slower, and the more completely you exhale, the more the vibrations come on. So keep concentrating on exhaling slowly and completely. Take fairly quick breaths in, and long and slooooow breaths out. Also, exhale absolutely completely each time. Once the tension is released, you will find the vibrations will keep going on their own. And if you haven't experienced a projection before then you are in for a real treat. Because once the vibrations begin running of their own accord, you need to prepare yourself for take off!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Do you mean, like when your body starts to vibrate all over, you're getting close to being able to attempt an OBE? I've had vibrations, but not all over. Just in my face and fingers.

<section>
When your entire body start starts to vibrate yes, you are at the onset of separation (speaking in traditional terms).
<br>
<br>
People who practice "energy work" I understand tend to get kind of mini-vibrations localised in places such as hands. I never do any energy work so I wouldn't know. But I do recognise the situation the original poster described very well, as I used to get the same problem (assuming it
<i>
 is
</i>
the same problem, of course).

Frank, last night I came as close as I have been to having an OBE. I woke up with strong vibrations over my entire body, and loud roaring sound of wind in my ears. There were clicking/popping sounds in my head too. I wasn't startled, or afraid, I knew what it was. This lasted a long time, but I could do nothing to get out of my body. I tried and tried, using visualisations not thinking about my physical body, but nothing worked.
<br>
<br>
Does this happen sometimes with experienced projectors that they can't exit when everything seems so promising, or is there always a way "out" and I need more experience to find the knack? I thought that with the roaring wind sound in my ears that I was bound to exit. I wonder how I could have stuffed it up??

The vibrations were certainly running on their own, I was ready for take off, but there was none.

Potatis: try to stand up, like you normally do! Not thinking about the physical body means when you walk or stand or sit, you are not listening on it just do it.
<br>
When I feel vibrations all over my body (not always) there is a point (you said before, too) when you know that you can separate. At this point, I move from my body. And I move only with my astral body.
<br>
<br>
So, if you are in that state just move.

<section>
Thanks for the tip SerGei! When I stand up, do I open my eyes, or do I just keep my eyes closed?
<br>
<br>
One of the things I tried whilst vibrating heavily was rolling over on my side, as I have read about the rolling out technique, but I could feel my physical body start to roll, I know it was my physical body, I could feel it was, I even opened my eyes a little and saw my bedroom then quickly shut my eyes again. I felt so awake, not in any sort of trance, yet I had these strong vibrations, and heard the howling wind sound in my ears. I felt physical, I did not feel light. I bet if I stood up, I would have stood up in the physical, not in any "astral body". I tried to move my arm, and could easily move my physical arm (I only did for a tiny bit), and my foot, I had no paralysis. These were very short tests, because I did not want to focus on the physical, I tried visualising myself flying outside, and tried to feel a rope to pull myself out with.
<br>
<br>
For the longest time I had a strong visualisation of running around the outside of some building. It was like a school, but there was nobody there. It was a stronger visualisation than I could normally do lying in bed at night, but it definately was far from real life, and was not an OBE. I wouldn't have had all those vibrations and wind sounds if it were, I'm sure. I was running around this building because unless I was always moving, I'd start to lose the visualisation. I was hoping to OBE into this scene, but after a long time I gave up trying.
<br>
<br>
It seemed like I had a lot of time to try many things, without the vibrations subsiding at all. My mind was wide awake, I kept thinking I should be in a trance or something, but it didn't feel like it at all.
<br>
<br>
After a while I gave up. I rolled around in bed to get myself comfortable, even stretched my arms and legs, tensing the muscles. The vibrations soon came back though over my whole body. After rolling over into a new position, I could feel faint vibrations happening somewhere in my upper back or shoulders. When I concentrated on them they suddenly buzzed through my whole body. I wasn't particularly relaxed, and felt mentally awake, so how was I able to have such strong vibrations? Normally I try to relax myself for ages and quiet my mind just to get some mild sensations. I can see it is different after sleeping.
<br>
<br>
If this should happen again, and all else fails, I'll hop out of bed as you suggest.

Potatis:
<br>
<br>
Try slow deep breathing and see if that changes the vibration state at all. When I used to "exit" more in a traditional sense, I often would get in a vibrational state but then I would have to increase its intensity before anything would happen.
<br>
<br>
I discovered that by breathing slowly and deeply, the vibrational intensity would increase many fold. It would get to the stage where it would feel as if I were sitting on a very unbalanced spin-dryer revolving at top speed. Just when I thought every molecule of my physical body was about to break apart, I'd take off like I had been shot from a cannon and crash-land within the Astral somewhere, lol, those days. I used to call it my
<i>
 cannonball exit
</i>
. :)
<br>
<br>
Also, try letting the vibrations come into your head. If you are like I used to be, you should feel an intense buzzing at the top of your head. I remember that, before take-off, it always felt like my head was about to burst the feelings were so intense. I just wanted to say also that I concur with SerGei, in that there is a point that you arrive at where you just know you can "separate". In the sense that it's not like you have to
<i>
 try
</i>
to do anything. You just do it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<section>
Thanks for your response Frank, I'll try the breathing next time. I had strong vibrations, but not to the degree you described, like about to break apart! Hehe. I'll see if breathing in the way you describe increases the vibes.

<section>
Interesting that you suggested that MajorTom because I have been reading more about energy work stuff since I had that experience the other night. (I am assuming that your post was directed to me, and not the original poster). I haven't done much in the way of energy work before, but when my whole body was vibrating, I could feel a thumping in the center of my chest, and somewhere around my belly button area. I was assuming these were chakras, but I thought the heart chakra might be at the heart, but this thumping was more in the centre of my chest. I could feel these two areas thumping like pistons, but nothing in my 3rd eye, throat or crown chakra area. I was trying not to focus on the physical much, but that is what I noticed.
<br>
<br>
I felt so relieved to finally feel such strong sensations, without pain. I thought I may never be able to project, because at times in the past I have requested an obe in dreams, and felt an enormous surge, I guess it was energy, and I would feel a severe "tickling" pain in my heart. I have in the past asked if anyone ever felt pain in their hearts when trying to have an obe, but nobody had heard of it. Apparently it was just me. As far as I know I am healthy with no heart probs, but sometimes in my dreams I'd get this painful surge in my heart. I now have new hope. I'll learn more about the chakras. I will try what you wrote MajorTom, I always try people's suggestions.

About vibrations.
<br>
I think that you stick on this state because you think that 'vibrations must come to project'. I think that this is false.
<br>
<br>
I don't always have vibrations, but I still can project. It is a side effect that can or can not exists.
<br>
<br>
But here is a more exact definiton:
<br>
<br>
Search with google for this:

 don degracia
</b>
. Locate his homepage, and read the
<b>
 'More about the trance state'
</b>
article.
<br>
<br>
This was the article that opened my eyes. It will be very useful for you and for everybody!
<br>
<br>
Have success!
<br>
<br>
Bests.

Yes, I've heard that. My post was about what is best to do if I wake up with vibrations like I did the other night, and loud wind sounds in my ears. If that should happen again I want to make the best use of it, not stuff it up like I must have done last time.

I have at least half a dozen different exit procedures and I try them one after the other.
<br>
<br>
These include the "lift off" (floating upwards), the "spin" (spinning about a vertical axis),  the "beam out" (beaming across the room directly into a standing position), the "roll out" (rolling out), the "walk out" (simply getting out of bed normally) and finally "phasing" (entering directly into a visual scene).  Well these are my major techniques.
<br>
<br>
I usually start with the "lift off" (because it's fun) but if this doesn't work I'll try them all in turn until one works.  Basically, when I'm in the "correct" mind-awake/body asleep condition one of these techniques invariably works, for me at least.
