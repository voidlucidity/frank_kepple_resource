<section>
1) Have you ever used AP in order to find more about past lifes? Did you find anything about that? More important: did you make any confirmation? Like: "in my past life i was MR XYZ, living in street ABV" etc and then confirm such info.
<br>
<br>
2) This question its more interesting to me: with AP, one learns more about the death process (the AP itself) and more about how to increase concentration (if you learn meditation, like a lot of APers do). TTese elements are good for be preparing a person for the death itself. So, when you really die, your mind/spirit it is (i think) more counscious during the death process. Its something that you are used to. Then you reeincarnate (after some days). Since you are doing it with a lucid mind, maybe, in your next life you will remember your past life. Some child can remember their past life (see Stevenson works on that), but for different reasons (violent death). So, is it possible that AP can allow one to be able to remember this life when dying?  To "transport" memories from this current life, to a future life? Can AP help in the death process on any way?

I have a problem with reincarnation.
<br>
<br>
90% of all people who have ever lived are alive today.  The world population is 6.5 billion.  Hence only 700 million people have ever died.  In other words
<i>
 there are only 700 million past lives to share around 6.5 billion people
</i>
- how does this work?
<br>
<br>
I would like a serious answer to this question?
<br>
<br>
To explain this anomoly, some commentators say that we have had lives on other planets.  Past life regression is now quite popular on UK TV and I have seen quite a few regressions.  However, no one has ever described an "alien" past life!
<br>
<br>
Any answers?

<section>
I really dont know how to explain that. I just deal with facts:
<br>
<br>
There are children that can remember past lifes and surprise their fathers with that. Many fathers wish that they never heard their child speaking about that. These child say things about their past lifes that can be confirmed. Sometimes they recognize members of the past family while seeing photos or even seeing such familiars directly. Stevenson its an investigator, for years, about these cases. You can read a book from Tom Shroder called "Old Souls: the scientific evidence for past lives". Tom was someone that followed in field Stevenson and his work. The book are the reports and observations on that trip in a very pleasurable way to read.
<br>
<br>
I think that the real reports from Stenvenson are hard to read (the work itself its hard) and hard to find.
<br>
<br>
Brian Weiss work about hypnotic regression for past lives with adults its interesting but he doesnt care on finding evidences like Stevenson and his patients get their past lives memorys with hypnotism. That means that their memorys can be "created". I mean, adults believe on what they see but it could be a creatiion of their own minds.
<br>
<br>
Stevenson works with child that still have a lucid memory and recall, without any trance induction method, memorys from their past life before the present one (in one case, one child could remember 2 lifes before this one).
<br>
<br>
My explanation for the existence of so many souls its more easy: there are new sould being created. Not everyone can remember past lives. Most of the adults that use hypnose for recall memorys maybe are creating them. Not everyone can have a past life.
<br>
<br>
This is a very simple explanation for something so complex. If reeicarnation its true, we must see that our universe its hard to understand, that we cannot learn everything.
<br>
<br>
Another possible explanation: many Astral Projectors here in the forum claim that they visit other worlds. If these worlds are real by themselves, and not as thought-forms created by their own minds, we must accept them as real objective worlds. In such case, there are many sould outhere living in thousands of worlds. Some of these worlds may be running low on life an others, like our world, are increasing.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
"Past Lives" is a belief construct that is gaining popularity. But within subjective reality there is no such thing as linear time. You DO have other focuses that you can merge with, but they are NOT you. You are you and they are they. But people are SO transfixed with the notion of linear time they cannot think beyond it.
<br>
<br>
Past-Life readings are gaining popularity and, as usual, the mystics are raking in the mega-bucks on whatever happens to be the latest New Age fraud, sorry, fad. But it's all just (what I call) an
<i>
 offset of convenience
</i>
... it's not my fault, it's a past life. Just the usual sound-good blurb in other words that happens to make no sense to people who actually go within themselves and learn the facts.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

you can still meet with these other focuses as you say Frank?  Would that be possible in F3?  It doesn't really matter if it's not me.  Can just about anyone that has died be found in F3 or do most people then shift past that?

<section>
Frank and Hans, i am not speaking about that fraud guys. I speak about childs and about childs that remember to be shepards, farmers and the like.
<br>
<br>
Second, my view its based on a buddhist view. When i speak oh reeincarnation i dont speak about personality transmigration but about the essence behind your soul.  That "thing" that make one human being seperate itself ftom the world. When people say "Me and you" there is a seperation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The "thing" behind that thoughts, the thing that "says" that there is a "me" and a "you" is what reeincarnate.
<br>

<br>
<br>
I see what you mean about time Frank, but for a more easy understanding, i prefer to speak in a more linear time view. Its like when you are trying to calculate the speed of a car, giving the time to reach the place, and giving the distance: you can use Newton equations...far away more easy and still accurate; or you can use time relativity formulas: much more accurate, althought very complex for such a case (the speed of the car).
<br>
<br>
The same here with my thoughts.

Frank, since I read the topic in the FAQ section about your model of Focuses I wondered what was your opinion on other lives.
<br>
You said there were other focuses but "they are not you", then what are they?

<section>
i think that frank its saying that we are not ourselves. I mean, there is not a thing called ego or "myself". When we say "i am..." we are creating an illusion. I like the buddhism analogy abot the sea: we are like water in a bottle. The water inside the bottle its our sould, the things that we call "me". The bottle itself its the body. When you die the bottle breaks up and the water spreads itself in the water.
<br>
<br>
Part of the water will merge with other water already existing in the sea. And that water will find another body (reeincarnation). But that water if different from the water in the old bottle (because it mixed with the water in the ocean). So, that "sould"/water, whatever, its nor the "me" from the old bottle/old body.
<br>
<br>
We never are "me", we are always mixing ourselves with the ocean (ocean= the universe/god/the clear light/etc  in this analogy).
<br>
<br>
In fact, the bottle its not closed, its open and mixing all the time with the ocean. There is no water in the bottle that you can say "this is the water of this bottle". No, you cant say that, because the water its always changing itself.
<br>
<br>
This idea apllys itself to reeincarnation, but i think it can apply to what Frank says: when you AP your mind will merge itself with other "water". So,  your ego changesa little during that time. You have a slight different personality while F3 (i suppose...i have no idea what is F3). When are ou but you are not you...do you get it now? maybe not, lol, but i am just guessng what Frank its trying to say.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Focus 4 of consciousness holds what you might call our individual Primary Essence. Each individual is a focus of his or her Primary Essence. Stemming from each of our Primary Essences, if you like, are many, many other focuses. A person may have thousands of other focuses. But these other focuses are NOT us. But they are directly connected to us, if you like, as they are a focus of the
<i>
 same
</i>
Primary Essence.
<br>
<br>
We can MERGE with these other focuses as they are of the same Primary Essence and they can MERGE with us. When I say merge I mean we can search within us and experience them. They are, most certainly "other lives" and other lives we can merge with and experience. But they are NOT us. They are other focuses of our Primary Essence.
<br>
<br>
Again, within subjective reality there is NO time. There is no such thing as past and future. All is present. This aspect of subjective reality is one of the most misunderstood aspects and causes a LOT of confusion. I've said a number of times that all this is to do with the way these, what are called, Trans-Dimensional Areas in consciousness function. I've been studying them for a while and they are mighty complex to get to grips with. I still have not managed to suss them out, yet.
<br>
<br>
But what people are calling "past lives" are, in fact, encounters with other focuses of their Primary Essence. The basic mistake people make is they assume the other person is them. How can it not be them? People think to themselves, after all, they know SO much about them. They can sense them inside, so it must have been another life, they assume. Just like when people looked to the sun and tracked its movements. It was OBVIOUS the sun revolved around the earth. Of course, the sun does not actually move around the earth at all. Quite the opposite. In a similar vein, these people are assuming that the people they are merging with are them. But the people that we encounter within us, in this particular respect, are NOT us. They are other focuses of our Primary Essence that we can merge with. I have done this a number of times. All you need do is project to Focus 4 and all will become apparent to you.
<br>
<br>
What people are calling "past-life regression" is, in fact, a merging with another focus in the action of an F1/F4 overlay experience. But I actually doubt that even these are all true mergings with other focuses. It may just be people observing other people within Focus 3 and not understanding that there is even a Focus 3.
<br>
<br>
There is a difference between merging and observing. When you merge with another focus you actually feel as if you have become that person. You haven't actually become them, all you have done is to merge with them. But it does feel like you have become them for the duration of the merging. Hence the reason why people mistakenly assume the other person was them at some stage.
<br>
<br>
Again, there is NO TIME within subjective reality. I cannot stress this point too highly. It is the source of MUCH confusion and misunderstanding.
<br>
<br>
I am NOT saying that the people who are thinking they are connecting with "past lives" are talking a complete load of BS. Nope, I am saying they are making the basic misassumption that they were once the other person. They are making the mistake of assuming their lives are occurring in a linear time framework. i.e. occurring in a sequential manner. In other words, that each life proceeds one after the other. Nope, all your focuses are living simultaneously and every one of your focuses is a different person. What "connects" them all, if you like, is they are a focus of the same Primary Essence within Focus 4 of consciousness and that is what makes it possible to merge with them.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

 <cite>
  Quote from: Kazbadan
 </cite>
 You can read a book from Tom Shroder called "Old Souls: the scientific evidence for past lives"
</blockquote>
Actually, I've read the book. It's an interesting book, but does not really constitute proof, since most of the subjects (albeit young children or teenagers) unfortunately were only interviewed after they had made contact with their past-life relatives, and it's therefore extremely hard to distinguish between real pre-natal memories and acquired false memories.
<br>
<br>
I am open on the subject.  The idea of reincarnation appeals to me but the simple logistics deny it.
<br>
<br>
One solution, which occurred to me and which I see both Kazbadan and Frank have expressed separately (I think), is that we don't recall our
<i>
 own
</i>
past lives at all.  All souls are all really essentially separate parts of a greater whole (or wholes) and therefore what we remember as our own past life is perhaps actually "someone else's" linear past life.  We don't recall our own linear past life, but someone elses.  But since we are essentially all part of each other, then in a sense it's also our own past life.
<br>
<br>
Both Robert Monroe and Bruce Moen have a similar concept to what Kazbadan, Frank and now I describe.  Monroe calls it the "I/There" and Moen the "Disk".
<br>
<br>
Of course, This may just be curve-fitting a solution, to what is otherwise a paradox, but it's the best I personally can do.
<br>
<br>
There are many so-called "hypnotic regression" exponents, and I
<i>
 really
</i>
would like to hear
<i>
 their
</i>
answer to this paradox, because to be honest I don't think they have one.  Most past-life regression practitioners skip over this issue, because they can't explain it, or otherwise amazingly, are not aware of it.

Thanks for the reply Frank.
<br>
<br>
So these other focuses are independent entities from each other or the "Primary essence" has it's counsciousness and chooses what focus to experience?
<br>
In either case, what do you think it's the purpose of experiencing the physical?
<br>
<br>
And if each focus is indeed an independent entity and the primary essence is what conects them all, what do you think it happens to a focus after he/her dies?
<br>
<br>
Also, in subjective reality there is no linear time but in each individual perception events happen in a linear way, for example, if i'm in focus3 talking to someone, i perceive the communication in a linear form: "he told me this, then told him this, and he told me that". Is this correct?

<section>
Kaz:
<br>
<br>
I can do better than give my opinion, I can tell you exactly what happens as I've been to these places and met people who have done it. And this is why the whole thrust of my work now is to get people focusing within Focus 3 of consciousness so they can discover all this for
<i>
 themselves
</i>
. It's no use messing about in the real-time zone, it's no use playing around doing "energy work" these are nothing but parlour tricks. If you want to learn the real truth about life, you need to get projecting within Focus 3 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Or in Monroe's terms Focuses 23 to 27 inclusive. This is why Monroe's work was streets ahead of the mystics. If you notice, his model virtually bypasses Focus 2 of consciousness. This is the area where most mystics revel in. This is where people have all their weird and whacky "astral projection" style experiences. In my model, I have actually brought Focus 2 of consciousness back into the general scheme of things, and introduced Focus 4. This latter area Monroe was touching on but could never quite get his head around it.
<br>
<br>
I have introduced Focus 2 because I believe the students of this art today will have the wherewithal, the sense of maturity, to realise the true nature of the place. As such, they will not become wrapped up in their own belief constructs to the extent where they become walking, talking self-fulfilling prophecies like the mystics and their followers of old. This is great, because Focus 2 is a handy springboard to the other areas. Plus, you can learn to manipulate your chances of success within the physical from within Focus 2 of consciousness, as we are a source/manifest reality system and Focus 2 is our source in that respect.
<br>
<br>
The notion of "soul" is a mystical and or belief construct that has come about because these people are forever fixated with "things". They
<i>
 objectify
</i>
everything and turn it into a "thing". They talk about "separation" and "rejoining" for example, yet there is NO separation in consciousness! They talk about us being "part of a whole" yet we ARE the whole already! Ultimately, what befalls these people is they are completely blinded by BODY FIXATION and, as I have said repeatedly on this forum, a body is merely an objective representation of the accumulation of a particular set of expectations regarding the enactment of certain types of actions within particular areas of consciousness. It holds no other purpose!
<br>
<br>
We DO NOT die. We actually shed our physical bodies as a tree sheds its leaves.
<br>
<br>
I've said before a number of times that what we objectively view as death is the action of a person shifting their Primary Focus [of attention] from Focus 1 to Focus 3 of consciousness. There is NO death! We are NOT our physical bodies! Our body is merely a biological machine that contains various senses, motor capabilities and communications facilities that allow us to create the experience of being physically oriented. We point our focus of attention at it and we can experience wherever the body happens to be.
<br>
<br>
Due to the nature of the way the physical body is constructed, we *must* keep a subjective energetic connection with the body at all times. If we withdraw this energetic connection then the physical body *will* cease to function within about 20 minutes to an hour. Because of this necessity, there is a particularly strong attraction between the physical body and ourselves. More so, for example, between yourself and an "etheric body" you might happen to create while projecting within the "real-time zone".
<br>
<br>
Generally, when an individual focus personality wishes to experience a particular area of consciousness they create a "bodily vehicle" that is tailored for use within that particular area. When you focus within the real-time zone, you typically create what mystics call an "etheric-body". I agree but it is not strictly necessary as they always try to make out, and even go so far as to create weird and whacky "silver chord". I mean, as an aside, why silver? I once created a really nice thick translucent gold one with a red lining. It was gorgeous and dead sexy. Silver is BORING in my opinion. These mystics just have NO imagination! I reckon this comes about from them following all the deeply boring, staid and stale teachings from the times when we used to dunk witches and burn people at the stake.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, for complete involvement within the RTZ you can create an "etheric body". When you refocus within the physical your etheric body then "dies" it dissipates, it's no longer required, and the experience is over, finished, etheric-body gone. Next time you want to experience the RTZ you simply create another one, experience what you want to experience and, when you have finished with the body you created it dissipates (dies) and so on and so forth, ad infinitum.
<br>
<br>
The physical is NO different. Only the cycle of creation and dissipation is different in its effect because you are involving the act of creation and dissipation on a much wider scale of events. But the underlying principle is the same. You want a physical experience then you create a body with which to do it. You do not have to, but for complete involvement then you would want to, which we do. When the time comes to cease your involvement, you withdraw your focus and allow the physical body to dissipate. As you do so, you switch your focus of attention from Focus 1 to Focus 3 of consciousness and get on with your life there. You do not change at all. The you of you, as I call it, remains the same.
<br>
<br>
The only problem or spoke-in-the-works of this natural transition has been placed by religions and mystics who attempt to control people within the physical. With religion, in the olden days, it was working hand in hand with the ruling hierarchy to achieve mass subservience amongst the general populace. Today it usually all boils down to money. Either in the pockets of the mystics and their hangers on, or religions like the Catholic Church funding places like the Vatican State, one of the richest places in the world.
<br>
<br>
Religions and mystics typically pitch themselves as an aid to the whole process, a boon that you can buy into while physical. Yet, anyone actually viewing the complete MESS their tacky beliefs have created within the lower branches of Focus 3 of consciousness will instantly see them as a barrier, not an aid. They are nothing but Psychic Frauds, in my personal opinion and I long for the day that people will start to see that.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi:

Please see the post above. A focus does not die. The focus personality merely shifts its Primary Focus. It is impossible for a focus to die. There is no time within subjective reality. There is no beginning or end. All simply IS.

<section>
I see what you say Frank. Its all about focus, but i still have some questions:
<br>
<br>
1) In a a very straight view, what do you mean its that people reeicarnate. Reeicarnate its just a word for "changing focus level". So, when i spoke about the childs that could remember their past live stheir were just remembering other levels of focus tha they had? Is that it. In very simple words we must say that they reeincarneted...can we say that (again, i am speaking in a very simplistic view)?
<br>
<br>
2) If we are just focus, we are always something that build itself in such a way that may seperate itself from the world. A focus can say or think "i am, you are", thus creating a seperation. This is the way we have to create ego. But a focus its always a focus.  When we reach nirvana ego ceases to exist. What happens to focus when you reach nirvana (something about i can only theorize)? Do you stop being a focus or still being one, just observing and living the world in a diffeent way?

3) It seems that your focus levels are different from Monroe levels. I searched on the faqs about that and i found nothing about the levels that you ise...only the typicals levels that goes about level 30 (level 1, level 2..that sounds like dungeons and dragons game or RPG Pc games to me, lol). Where can i get info about the levels you speak? And information about how to reach such states?
<br>
<br>
4) i remember a 4th question but  i just forget which one was! grrrr...!!

 Hi:
 <br>
 <br>
 Please see the post above. A focus does not die. The focus personality merely shifts its Primary Focus. It is impossible for a focus to die. There is no time within subjective reality. There is no beginning or end. All simply IS.

When i said die, i meant the end of the physical existense of course. You did reply to my question, when you said that after the physical experience ends the focus shifts back to focus 3.
<br>
That's the answer i was hoping for, i really dislike the "merge with your oversoul/the source/whatever" theorys.
<br>
<br>
One thought: What if for two physical experiences i choose the same time period and I "meet myself"? That would be weird.

I will take the liberty of answering these questions based on my understanding of Frank's previous post.  I am doing this so Frank doesn't have to write 10 novels all at once and can finish Astral Projection Truth
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
However, I don't have the experience Frank has and can probably not totally wrap my head around these concepts to the level of his understanding.

<br>
Your mistake here was when you said "other levels of focus THEY HAD".   These of focuses are focuses of our "primary essence", but distinct from us.  As Frank said "We are we, and they are they".  The reason people latch on to the other focuses during "past life regression" is because these other lives are separate focuses of our "primary essence"(i think Monroe called it our Oversoul).  You see, there is NO time in Focus 2-4 and so our liner view of time and concept of "PAST lives" falls apart in these higher focuses. Frank states that here:
<br>
<br>
"Again, within subjective reality there is NO time. There is no such thing as past and future. All is present. This aspect of subjective reality is one of the most misunderstood aspects and causes a LOT of confusion"
<br>
<br>
So, from the above what I gather is our primary essence, Focus 4, has MANY SIMULTANEOUS focuses going on AT THE SAME TIME.  Time only has bearing to us in the physical, but our primary essence is truly timeless.  Reincarnation imposes the limitation on time on something that is timeless, and therefore breaks down with subsequent knowledge of the wider reality (basically an inaccurate belief construct).

<br>
Again this may be semantics but when you use the word "Nirvana" you are imposing Buddhist notions on Franks model of the wider reality.  The two models are mutually exclusive.  However, I too would like to know if one lives out the rest of their days in Focus 3, or do they move on to something else?  Do we keep our ego in focus 3?  Because, mine rather likes itself

Kaz:
<br>
<br>
Reincarnation is a religious/mystical belief construct and has nothing to do with focuses, "levels" or otherwise. I have said repeatedly that the focuses I present are NOT levels or places they are
<i>
 focuses of attention
</i>
. There is a difference between a focus of attention and an individual focus personality.
<br>
<br>
A focus personality is a person who engages particular focuses of attention within their available consciousness continuum, and is an individual focus of their Primary Essence. But they are NOT the ONLY focus of their Primary Essence. We each have many, many individual focuses of our Primary Essence resident within many, many other physical-like dimensions including this one. Many of us will have a small number of either "parallel focuses" or "near focuses" resident within this dimension of reality. This is only normal.
<br>
<br>
In a very simplistic view, looking at it from the point of view of thinking within linear time constraints, I can see how the notion of "reincarnation" could have come about. But that is just mystics and other religious types making the same old mistakes of the past.
<br>
<br>
To understand the reality of this issue entails a complete understanding of the functioning of what are known as Trans-Dimensional areas in consciousness. As I have said a number of times, I cannot yet provide a full explanation of the workings of these as the understanding of these areas is darned tricky and it is a subject I have been working on only for about a year. It's a Focus 4 thing and it would appear that anything to do with Focus 4 stretches the ability of people to explain in mere words. Little wonder Monroe left it alone.
<br>
<br>
I am hoping to provide some computer graphic simulations within a year or two that will explain things better than mere words. Well, this depends on other things falling into place. Last week the Frank Kepple Foundation was set up, but if no one subscribes to my Virtual Classroom and no one were to buy my book, then I'm gonna be stumped as I am not a wealthy person. I live a very frugal life and I am hoping to plough back the lion's share of any profits into further research for the benefit of us all. In a few years time I am hoping that the answers to these basic questions will be known to a substantial number of us. Not just in terms of learning, but in terms of actual hands-on experience.
<br>
<br>
Essentially, you are a focus personality adopting particular focuses of attention. You never "cease to exist". There is NO TIME within subjective reality. As such, there can be NO beginning or end. I keep trying to stress this but people are SO transfixed with the idea of linear time they just cannot seem to step out of it in their thinking.
<br>
<br>
As regards Monroe and the translation of respective focus states between my model of consciousness and his, I have posted on this a number of times but it is a subject I will be covering in the next edition of the newsletter due out at the end of this current month.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

catmeow: A possible solution would be that time is not linear. It would then be possible to reincarnate in the past = no math problems

I doubt that this explanation is really satisfying for you though

Since Logic is based on cause and effect (IMO) and cause and effect is based in linear time

Logical thinking just seems to collaps if we introduce non linear time.

Hi Tombo
<br>
<br>
Good thinking... I don't discount the idea of reincarnating into the past... in fact it's a good idea, but then we would get people remembering and describing
<i>
 future lives
</i>
too!  Once again, I haven't see any "future life" regressions on TV yet (we actually have a daily TV program where they do past-life regression).  Perhaps they haven't thought to try future-life pro-gression yet!
<br>
<br>
Another possibility, is that there are many parallel dimensions and many physical worlds similar to ours in which we could have had many past lives.  yet another possibility is we spawn multiple copies of ourselves as we go forward through linear time, so right now there might be thousands of copies of "me" who have lived and shared the same single past life.
<br>
<br>
All of these ideas I think have been expressed by Frank (so Frank I'm not ignoring you!).  I'm just using different terminology.
<br>
<br>
But really the point I'm making is that reincarnation doesn't make any sense at all in the traditional linear time single soul viewpoint. So if that's how you see reincarnation... it can't be that way!

Agreed.  I heard the 90% figure somewhere and haven't researched it, but the figure is definitely somewhere between 50% and 90% so we have a problem here!

Your questions are very interesting.

First question. You're correct, I've never heard of a past-life regression where the individual describes a "past life" which is running concurrently with his present life!
<br>
<br>
Second question. This is a good question. In a universe of no-time there can be no change. Learning implies change.  Therefore there can be no learning.

Anybody got any ideas?

<br>
<br>
That theory of focus its interesting. I read somewhere that we can be seen like lanterns. We can focus th elight to where we want. Sometimes we focus the light in the physical world and thats all we can see. Other times we may focus the light on the astral realms...some people (Buddha) may have more lights to point too..maybe they can see everything at the same time...
<br>
<br>
What do you think about this analogy? is it good for understanding the focus that you speak about? or do you speak in a thing slightly different?

<section>
Shinobi:
<br>
<br>
These are excellent questions that I must have overlooked on the other thread you mention.
<br>
<br>
I freely admit that I (for one) do not have the full answers. I will not get them until I can take in the full picture of Focus 4 of consciousness. I am not even sure whether it is actually possible for a physically focused individual to take in that
<i>
 full
</i>
picture. Focus 2 and Focus 3 are easy by comparison, as they are so "earth like" or "human like" and people have usually just made something up for the rest. In the olden days they called it "god" in significance of all they couldn't explain. But technology moves on, our understanding widens, and this topic is no different.
<br>
<br>
Listening to some of the mystics anyone would be forgiven for thinking we were still in the Dark Ages. Dunking witches, burning people at the stake and wearing garlic necklaces to ward off demons. But today we are attempting to broaden our understanding and pave the way for the new paradigm. So here we are calling it Focus 4 of consciousness. An area in consciousness that we can now learn to experience for ourselves (with a little effort in the right direction, of course).
<br>
<br>
Now, anything involving Focus 4 of consciousness is completely mind blowing, and I do not say this lightly. It is an area I have not been able to "explore" as fully as I would like. It is my current challenge, you could say.
<br>
<br>
The BIG difficulty with Focus 4 is that it's an area of fully subjective reality. There is no notion of Time, so in turn there is no notion of Space either. Focus 4 occupies no Space at all and yet it encompasses the other areas, namely, Focus 1, 2 and 3. So our whole physical universe (and all the other universes besides, but let's put them aside for a moment) is encompassed by Focus 4. Yet "outside" of Focus 4 there is nothing because Focus 4 encompasses all that is within our system. Focus 4 occupies no space, yet it encompasses our whole physical universe. Okay, so that's the first hurdle. Problem is, to us, if something occupies no space then it cannot possibly exist. Reason being we are so attached to "things".
<br>
<br>
Second hurdle: to understand Focus 4 it is necessary to take on board an understanding of infinity. This latter aspect is perhaps the most mind-blowing of all. Because, in infinity, everything happens an infinite number of times. Which means everything that has or will come about, has
<i>
 already
</i>
happened.
<br>
<br>
From our somewhat limited linear-time perspective, we may consider a life began, it ended, and it began again. But from the perspective of Focus 4, nothing has begun and nothing has ended. All simply IS. The whole notion of beginning and end is a physical construct. From this restricted, highly limited viewpoint, people make far-reaching assumptions about the Wider Reality. Thus, constructs such as "reincarnation" come about. But when you actually look at the FACTS of the matter. When you actually step within Focus 4 and experience it for yourself, all begins falling into place. Well, that is what is steadily happening to me and I cannot be the only person in the world today who has stepped into Focus 4 of consciousness. I realise this kind of thing is quite rare and, hopefully, it will start to become more common as people begin duplicating my work.
<br>
<br>
Most "life regression" if you wish to call it that (I personally don't mind as I can see what you mean) comes through in the way it does, simply because people present themselves with the opportunities to notice what they choose to address. In that sense, people develop a tastefulness for certain aspects that resonate amongst us. We feel it "makes sense" so we believe it. But this phenomenon can readily occur entirely independently of the facts of the matter in hand; as it does in this case in the light of my hands-on experience.
<br>
<br>
When we project within subjective reality, each of us typically places ourselves in the position or anticipation of facing objects. But when you enter Focus 4, you cast off all notions of "things" and begin merging with the underlying subjective energy. That same energy, down the line, as it were, will ultimately split off here and there (again all in a manner of speaking) and create a "thing". That thing could be a soccer ball, a human being, a house, a plant, a giraffe, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Now, in merging with energy, I do not mean you are merging into a vast pool of nothingness. On the contrary. Typically you are merging with a specific
<i>
 action
</i>
of energy. I suppose you could say, in a very broad sense (and only in a very broad sense) you are merging with a "thing" but a thing in terms of its conceptualisation, or it's source in other words. And that source of all that is within our system is Focus 4 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
So, ultimately, all "things" can be traced to an action in energy, the ultimate source of which is Focus 4. In other words, you could say, Focus 4 is the area of the action of the thought before it is created. But again, only in a manner of speaking because, from the Focus 4 standpoint, there is no before. All simply is. The concept of "before" comes into it as the action is engaged further "down the line" as it were...
<i>
 and that is where the primary mistake is made regarding the notion of reincarnation and past-lives.
</i>
<br>
<br>
All our sense of objectivity revolves around a linear time framework. To the extent where it is, currently, virtually impossible for a person to "step out" of this mode of thought.
<br>
<br>
It is FAR EASIER to believe in the false notion of reincarnation, and so it becomes! (Better the devil you know, I suppose.) Myself, I am currently finding that disassociating myself from the notion of linear time is next to impossible and takes
<i>
 tremendous
</i>
mental effort. Okay, maybe I'm just a bit thick and other people would get it more quickly. Either way, the pursuit of this type of experience is not to be sneezed at.
<br>
<br>
Naturally I am hoping that, at some future stage, a clear set of guidelines can be presented that would make it easier for people to encompass and understand the Focus 4 experience.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
<br>
The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
<br>
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
<br>
And cometh from afar:
<br>
Not in entire forgetfulness,
<br>
And not in utter nakedness,
<br>
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
<br>
From God, who is our home:
<br>
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
<br>
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
<br>
Upon the growing Boy,
<br>
But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,
<br>
He sees it in his joy;
<br>
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
<br>
Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
<br>
And by the vision splendid
<br>
Is on his way attended;
<br>
At length the Man perceives it die away,
<br>
And fade into the light of common day.
