There was a question about the B.Moen method on this BBs just recently and I happened to notice a chat session with the man himself at 9pm ET:

I'm not exactly sure how ET relates to UK time. But I would recommend for beginners at Astral projection to try and ask a question or two... if your time-zone allows.
<br>
<br>
Reason being, full-blown Astral projection is generally a heck of a tricky thing to accomplish (which Mr Moen accepts). But he developed a method which he calls, "Focussed Attention".
<br>
<br>
This is a method which holds the promise of bringing a person many of the advantages of being able to explore non-physical realms, but with the minimum of hassle-factors (such as those posed by what people call "negs" for example).
<br>

Yours,
