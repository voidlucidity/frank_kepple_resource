Hi guys,
<br>
I've been interested in a topic of Astral Projection for a few years. I did some light reading, but didn't actively pursue it until a few months ago. I read Buhlman's Adventures Beyond the Body and started trying some meditation, affirmations, a little chakra work. I achieved two lucid dreams, movement sensations, vibrations. In short, I think I was very close. I quit because I was busy doing other things, but I knew I would come back to it for sure.
<br>
<br>
Recently, I had two interesting dreams that I knew indicated that I should be trying again. Sometimes I think that maybe they were actual astral projections, but not fully conscious. The first time I felt like I was climbing an imaginary rope and I thought to myself finally I'm going to get on the roof. Then I saw the roof, but I ended up in a city with tall buildings. Second time, I fell and ended up in the same city that looked sooo familiar and felt as if I was descending. I thought I was out of my body, but when I woke up I decided that it was a dream. Not sure still. Either way, the feeling of familiarity and freedom was amazing. I love it!
<br>
<br>
Right now, I'm reading the book Mastering Astral Projection. Today is my second day through the course...I have really high hopes for it.
<br>
<br>
So I guess the question is how do I tell if it's a dream or projection? I keep thinking that since I know so much about astral projection already I could have just made it all up in my dream

Hi Lenka,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Take some time to get a feel for the different subforums within this website as they cover a good deal of ground. There are many questions for example, that get asked over and over again, and we have a pretty decent search engine we ask members to utilize.
<br>
<br>
Also, there is a forum entitled
<b>
 <i>
  Welcome to Permanent Astral Topics!
 </i>
</b>
that has a number of excellent threads that remain there because of their recurring value.
<br>
<br>
In a number of the OBE/AP (and other) forums you will also see
<b>
 sticky
</b>
topics. These have been made to remain in place also because of an ongoing value.
<br>
<br>
We'll look forward to your participation,
<br>
Nick
