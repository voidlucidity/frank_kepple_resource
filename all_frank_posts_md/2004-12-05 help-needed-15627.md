Hello!! My name is Christyl and I am new to this forum.  I had a very moving OBE about 2 years ago where I met with my Granny.  No one could convience me it was a dream.  About 6 months ago I found out what had happened to me and was blown away!!!ever since I have tried to induce the OBE state and rarely do I even make it to the vibrational state.  It is VERY frustrating.  Ive tried lots of methods and have had 2 lucid dreams but thats about it!!! What am I doing wrong?

It sounds to me like you are trying
<i>
 way
</i>
too hard. As you say in your signature: open your heart and your mind, and give up any preconceived ideas about what is real. That's very good advice. Especially as people normally end up tripping over their own preconceptions.
<br>
<br>
You have a preconception that you have to reach a "vibrational state". What if you are one of these people who never experience any kind of vibrations? Myself, I used to but haven't experienced anything other than a light buzzing feeling for ages, and I project now more than I ever have!
<br>
<br>
Two years ago, a part of you that you would normally suppress, you allowed to surface. As a result, it gave you a very moving experience. Okay, so now I have a couple of questions for you. At the time of this original experience, did you have to induce this state? And, did you use any kind of method or technique to experience this state?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
