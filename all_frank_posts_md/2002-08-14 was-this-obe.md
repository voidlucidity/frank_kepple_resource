<section>
I have been using the Gateway Wave I HemiSync CD off and on for  a couple of months without significant experinces, but last nite while watching TV I had an unusual experience.
<br>
I was watching Lord of the Rings where Frodo and Sam were walking across a field leaving the Shire. I had a strange Deja Vu feeling. I started writing down things that triggered similar feelings, and all of a sudden I seemed to be getting memory flashes from someone else! It was extremely familiar, lasting about 15 minutes, but I couldn't pin it down. It was accompanyed by a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. I was on the verge of discovering what the memories were about when they stopped. I have almost no memory of the incident now, except that they seemed to be dream memories of playing a complex game? This was similar to almost remembering a dream, then losing all memory of it.
<br>
Did I have a partial past life recall experience? Was this a partial OBE?

hi dwalker
<br>
<br>
No, it was not an OBE, but it was definitely an interesting otherworldly moment!  Thanks for sharing it.
<br>
<br>
My ex had a grandmother who did "automatic writing."  She would go into a trance and out would come this STUFF!  She even had a book of her automatic writing published . . . it was mostly exstatic (sp?) religious expression . . .  love love love hail to god kind of stuff.  Very beautiful.  If you ever encounter "The Book of El," she wrote it.
<br>
<br>
Anyway!  It is possible that you were channeling someone else's experiences, or simply remembering your own deep/past ones. I wouldn't be surprised if your listening to those CDs opened you up a bit.  If this is what you'd like to have happen in your life, congratulations!

 One thing you have to remember is that just because you have no memory of an OBE doesn't mean you fail.  One of the harder aspects of OBE is actually downloading the memory into your conscious mind when the experience is over. That is why a lot of people think that they failed at attempting an OBE, they just don't remeber it.
 <br>
 <br>
 So this is my theory, maybe you were 'remembering' a past OBE that you have had.

Yes, I am trying to 'open up' a little bit by using the HemiSync tapes. I always thought that when trying to recall a past life, you needed to go looking for it. It was interesting to have those 'memories' just arrive as if they were always there. It's hard to explain this type of thing, but those who have been there know what I mean!
<br>
<br>
It's interesting that the memories arrived when I started writing down things that evoke the same kind of feeling I had when I saw the scene in the movie. Some of the things I wrote were, Autumn colors, harvest, corn fields, wagons, dirt roads, etc. The memories arrived as soon as I stopped writing.
<br>
'Feelings' seem to be the key. It's not what you see, it's how you feel about seeing it, or thinking about it.

<br>
It sounds like you had a kind of remote viewing experience where the memory flashes were almost certainly coming from within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Please understand that there are all kinds of weird and wonderful side-effects that come about when attempting to increase your level of awareness, Astral-wise. These effects can be triggered by just about anything, or they can just come about for no apparent reason.
<br>
<br>
Aside from my Astral projection experiences, for example, I must get at least one and often two or three occassions during the day where I see flashes of images, or some voice or other telling me stuff.
<br>
<br>
The weirdest one happens to me about once a week, that's been happening for about 2 years.
<br>
<br>
I can be sitting in a chair, just quietly contemplating something, then, all of a sudden, I go into a kind of trance state where I hear myself talking. My vocal chords, mouth and tongue are all moving in the normal way, exactly like if I were reading out loud. It's my voice, but it's not actually me who is initiating the conversation. The subject of the "voice" is always something to do with the Astral that I may have been struggling to comprehend.
<br>
<br>
I feel it's best not to concentrate on these infill experiences too much as they can distract you from the focal point of your study. But they are often fascinating experiences, that serve as a handy pointer letting you know you are definitely making progress.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Greetings Frank:
<br>
<br>
I would suggest that your Astral connections might have bought about "mediumistic" tendencies whereby another entity is attempting to use you to convey messages to the material world. This appears to be very much a classic way in which this occurs initially, and can then develop greatly.
<br>
<br>
If your wife is supportive, or you have a close friend is not sceptical about these things, I would strongly suggest that you allow yourself to go fully into this trance, while your assistant asks questions and records what is said with a recorder. It might be an Astral level spirit, or a much more highly evolved spirit from a higher vibrational level using an astral level body as a transformer, or intermediary if you like.
<br>
<br>
This is almost
<b>
 exactly
</b>
how the medium of Silver Birch first experienced his guide (who is a very highly evolved spiritual light being), and many, many other mediums started out this way as well. It is a very great gift.
<br>
<br>
I am launching a new community website very soon, totally complimentary with this one, and which is much more highly geared towards Spiritual issues - beyond the issues we discuss here to discover and discuss what it all means.
<br>
<br>
Announcement soon.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Thanks for your responses, everyone! I don't know if I'd classify this as remote viewing, because these images are familiar to me. Its as if I was thinking about things that happened to me, such as a fishing trip or school experience. The familiarity is there, but I don't remember actually experiencing the event.
<br>
<br>
In Robert Monroe's first book, he talks about 'stepping into another life' on another plane. In this other life, he 'is' this person, but has no consious memory of ever having been this person. The memories are completly familiar to him, but he doesn't understand them or remember them.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I'm falling asleep I'll experience this. It will be just flashes of memories, ideas, or insight that seem to be mine, but yet they can't be. Frequently, I'll have a fleeting image of solving a complicated mathematical equation where the solution seems so clear and obvious, then it will vanish.

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
I would just mention that "remote viewing" is not actually visual at all - it is perceptive without imagery.
<br>
<br>
What you describe is more like clairvoyance.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>

<br>
Thanks, Adrian, for your feedback.
<br>
<br>
The trance state occurs at random and I do not, as yet, realise I am doing it. It just happens and I only really realise after it has finished. Although I do have a good recollection as to what has been said. The sessions last only a short time, 5 minutes perhaps, and what is being related to me is normally the answer to some big Astral problem I'm having.
<br>
<br>
I've obviously heard about the works of "mediums" but never really understood it all as my primary focus is Astral Projection. But what you say sounds very interesting.
<br>
<br>
I'm also very interested in your new website. I think it is a *great* idea.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
It is my pleasure! But yours does sound like a classic case of an entity wanting to use you as a medium if you allow it. It wouldn't surprise me - you will have drawn alot of attention to yourself in your Astral roamings

<br>
Any advanced being is forbidden by universal laws to use another person in this way in the long term against their will. You could block them. But in my opinion it would be much better to make contact to see who is at the door. These situations are
<b>
 much
</b>
too important to disregard IMO.
<br>
<br>
My new website focusses very strongly on all  of these issues, and I hope to launch it in the next week or so.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
