hello  to the people
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
i have realised how to  tap into hypnogogic sounds,   but whenever they start  i break trance???
<br>
<br>
i dont see how it is possible to not aknoledge these sounds???
<br>
<br>
i have seen people on these forums say "learn to ignore them"   but i dont see how.
<br>
<br>
I am assuming you cant learn to ignore them,  but you gradually begin to ignore them as you  experience them more.

Think of them as signs that indicate your progress. Imagine driving along a motorway and you see the sign for your exit that tells you it is 1 mile ahead. You don't have to stop to acknowledge the sign. You observe the sign in passing whilst keeping your primary focus on the junction ahead. So, in a sense, you are not looking to
<i>
 ignore
</i>
these sounds and/or images, you want to be looking out for them. Because they are definite indicators of your progress.

To further amplify Franks' good reply it is all about where you put your FOCUS- if you look at the sounds as real and follow them you will be led down a different path than if you just hear them -with maybe 10% of your awarenes- but focus the rest of your awareness  on the other stuff going on- are you seeing images, feeling the sensation of seperation, or energy surges? You must have other stuff going on because every time I have heard them I was also in the middle of seperating from the old bod.
