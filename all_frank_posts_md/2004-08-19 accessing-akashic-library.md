Do you know a good method for this? Meditation is the key of course. To make ourself an antenna..
<br>
Some say we should visualize white light. Others that we should focus on the third eye.
<br>
<br>
How about focusing on a question that i search answers to?
<br>
<br>
Can we access every thought in the world or just our owns? Is it easier during a lucid dream?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help

I'm not sure on the meditation thing as it's something I've never done. I'm more of a follower of the Monroe school and in those terms Focus 27 is the mental state you need to achieve. You can basically access whatever information you wish that is aligned to your personal development.

Thanks Frank! I can´t search in the forums so i try asking. Is the Monroe school based on music/sounds to achieve other brain frequencies? Like binaural beats? Something like Brainwave generator?
<br>
<br>
Have you had success with Monroe?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help

The pioneer was a chap called Bob Monroe who researched over a number of years, and attached a series of arbitary numbers to various internal mental states he called Focus Levels. Later on he founded the Monroe Institute where he went on to develop a series of tapes and CDs which uses what you might call binaural beats, and other effects, in order to try and achieve these states.
<br>
<br>
It's not an exact science so, as you would expect, people report varying degrees of success. You don't actually need these tapes or CDs to get to these states. Various techniques are possible. If you were to do an internet search on monroe +"focus levels" I'm sure it would throw up a lot of info.

Hey all good topic! I recentl read a spritual development book called bieng your higher self, by Sanya Roman. one of the chapters is called seeing the bigger picture and exlpains how through recieving insights and revelations we can lift the vails of illusion we expirence through incarnating in this dense dimmension and see the bigger picture of our lives i.e why we are here, life on other planets, our lifes purpose etc at the end of each chapter is a meditation to practice, the one at the end of that chapter is a journy to the Akaishic records, which like everything else we can reach with our minds, I could describe the medetation but there are other meditations to do before to prepare you for that stage, so I would Recomend the book, its well worth a read. Best wishes Marcus.

I have an odd question,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Last night I was speaking to a friend of mine about how I want to astral travel and visit the Akashic library, and possibly look up my past lifes or maybe even future lifes....  She then told me that while in the Akashic library you can view anything, except for something about yourself, so you need someone to get the records for you?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any ideas on this???
<br>

LRJ: Take it from me, you can access any information that pertains to your development. Finding out what will happen to you in your current life does not normally come under this umbrella as it would spoil the punch-line somewhat.

Which is probably what your friend meant.
<br>
<br>
Normally you would seek this information with the help of someone who already knew their way around, so to speak. So it's better if you seek a guide first once you manage to get within the non-physical.
<br>
<br>
Being party to info on other aspects of your self can have quite a profound affect on a person. So it's not information that is normally handed out willy nilly. Don't be surprised if you have to get to quite a high stage of proficiency first, before they start handing you the juicy bits.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck in your quest.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
