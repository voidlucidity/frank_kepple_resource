 Selski and Nick:
 <br>
 Thanks for the welcome.  I look forward to exploring.
 <br>
 <br>
 I joined yesterday and then found the link for Astral Pulse on The Crossroads links page.  Nice synchronicity.
 <br>
 <br>
 I guess the time has come.

 Leannain and Frank:
 <br>
 Yes I am feeling very welcome here.
 <br>
 <br>
 Nice to find a new group home with people of aligned purpose and like mindedness, even if we are all diverse.
 <br>
 <br>
 I love the topics:  dreaming, magick, astral travel, psychic protection, quantum metaphysics.
 <br>
 <br>
 right up my alley.

Interesting, massage schoo.
<br>
<br>
Are a lot of massagers interested in stuff like this?
<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy the forum.

 Well things change.
 <br>
 I can't get financial aid because I didn't pay taxes a few years back.
 <br>
 <br>
 Oh, well, it was a good vibe.  I can still massage people.  Hopefully won't rub them the wrong way.

 I write.  I want to be a writer, a published writer.
 <br>
 <br>
 I think this was a lesson for me not to ignore my work that I am here to do.  I don't need a degree to do that.

hi sunwolf!
<br>
<br>
just looking out some familiar names on the forum. i'm starting the MAP in 90 days journey on magnetic dragon and came here for some back-up and support. you know i'm not the most dedicated person in the universe so i thought i'd hook up with some familiar faces from around here to keep me in check.

 Hey Reality Failure:
 <br>
 Thanks for the wake up call.
 <br>
 I have to get over here more often.
 <br>
 <br>
 My life has been really stressful with a certain part-time job. Look forward to changing that.
 <br>
 <br>
 What is the MAP?

mmm...
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://masteringastralprojection.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://masteringastralprojection.com
</a>
is the link i think.
<br>
<br>
it's a 90 day manual to follow, it guides you on your journey to AP through the use of affirmations, exercises, BWGen presets and cool techniques.
<br>
<br>
there is a forum about it at the bottom of the main forum.
<br>
welcome to mastering astral projection!
<br>
<br>
it was written by brian mercer and robert bruce.

 <br>
 Ah, yes, Astral Travel.  I remember my astral travel days.
 <br>
 <br>
 It was fun.
 <br>
 <br>
 Got too much on my plate to start another journal at this time, but thanks for the suggestion and offer.
 <br>
 <br>
 Nice to see someone I know here.
