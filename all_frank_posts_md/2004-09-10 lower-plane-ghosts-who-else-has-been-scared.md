ello there. im 14 and about 5 months or so ago i was taking a nap in my mums bed and id been listening to the radio beforehand. i woke up and the light was off but the lamp was on, giving the room an orangey-red glow. i felt soooooo heavy and wanted to get up so i slid off the bed onto the floor and laughing at myself, i dragged myself with my forearms to the door, i layed there for ages staring out onto the landing wondering why it was so quiet, i was really nackered but eventually i stood up and turned around to face the room, i looked around and when my eyes met the computer chair, there was a very young girl sitting on it, she was brown and white like an old picture and she smiled and waved. i was just like "wow... the first time ive seen a ghost" so i waved back but suddenly i found myself paralyzed and i rose into the air. i couldnt talk or move and i thought "what is she going to do to me" thinking she was like a demon but i caught glimpse of someone in the bed as i floated above them, then i felt myself wake up for real and i was stunned..... its like whhhoooaaaa but i quickly fell back to sleep and amazingly i woke up lying in the bed again and the room was glowing with the lamp again and infront of me this really tall man with a red shirt on was just standing there with his back turned to me, i thought it must be my dad (i hoped) and i tried to say hello but i just seemed to hiss from my throat and i couldnt move again, so i just watched, and he just stood there for a looong time eventually i fell back to sleep.
<br>
<br>
now, since then i have read up on this and when astral travelling it is meant to be quite rare to encounter anyone else, and if you do they are most likely to be lower plane undesirables (bad people who are confused asto whether they are dead or not and often just stand there confused for aaaaaages) like, i presume, the ones i met. im not sure why i saw two in one night on my first astral travel but if i do it again i really dont want to see them again, coz they scared the .... out of me. i dunno why, but that guy just standing there was terrifying, he didnt move, his head was down and he ha dsuch an evil presence. anyway, i'm reaaaally interested in hearing about any spirits youve encountered and whether they freaked you out.
<br>
<br>
thanks 4 reading my really badly written obe. love from ryokie (hope to hear what ya have ta say soon!)xxxxxxxxxx

I'm not sure where you've been doing your reading?  Lower planes bad people?  Rare to meet other travelers?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps you need some better reading material?
<br>
<br>
It sounds like your own fears caused you more problems than anything on the Astral.  Seeing your body while OBEing causes many people problems until they get used to it.  She was probably there to help you, not harm you.  You don't need to be awake to be harmed.  The man didn't do anything to you either, simply stood there.
<br>
<br>
Try reading through some of the Forum experiences, there are some similiar ones to your experiences.

Wherever did you get the idea it was rare to see other people within the astral. The place is chock full of them! Thing is, it is normal to be scared at first but eventually you get over it and the astral becomes a fun place to go to.

Yeah I have had visitors too.  Many of them just seemed to be amused by me.  That's about all.  I don't think they are evil.

There are a few basic ground rules that I'm going to write up about in the FAQ section sometime when I get chance that I feel if people would get to grips with understanding first, they wouldn't have such a bad time.
<br>
<br>
The astral is populated; there is no doubt about that. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong. The place is not populated by "entities" or "beings" or "ghosts" or whatever, it is populated by
<u>
 people
</u>
(and other wildlife but for now I'm concentrating on the people aspect). They are just people, exactly like you and I, only they are sans physical. This is a perfectly normal state for a person to be in. In fact, it could be said to be more of a normal state than being physical.
<br>
<br>
Just because someone is confused about being dead or not, doesn't make them bad; or some kind of demon. Problem is, when we project we drag all our emotional baggage and other superstitious and/or religious conditioning with us.
<br>
<br>
Within the physical we have the luxury of being able to think and believe what we like and
<u>
 not
</u>
have our surroundings chopping and changing to suit our emotional state. This is by no means the case within the astral. Think of the astral environment as a mirror that reflects our every thought, deed and action. If a person is seeing evil, then they are thinking evil; if they are experiencing confusion, then their thinking is confused; if their circumstances are out of control, it's because their thinking is out of control; if a person is about to attack us, it's because we think we are about to be attacked, and so on.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, the astral environment is ever so fluid, meaning it chops and changes so easily and seamlessly, to the extent where we believe we are reacting to the changes in the environment. When it is in fact the other way around, our environment is reacting to changes in us: in particular our emotional state.
<br>

There is a lot to wonder about this. It sounds more like the astral is a projection inside yourself than something that exists outside, from your description. What you describe reminds me of my dreams - actually, it's a fairly accurate depiction of the laws therein.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, so far my (unfortunately brief) experiences out of body have been nothing even close to this. Perhaps this is because they have been more RTZ? Maybe there needs to be more distinction between what you mean by "in the astral"?
<br>
<br>
Also, in your FAQ it might be nice if you'd explain how to best navigate this emotionally-transient state. As it is, it seems like it would be most desirable to avoid it altogether - but I doubt that you would agree.
