<section>
I am just wondering if anyone else out there who has regular lucid dreams has a sleep disorder or thinks they might have one?  I have insomnia.

i think i may have sleep apnea, most times I will get really deep relaxation and trance and i just stop breathing.  I have to come partially out of the trance and start breathing again, otherwise I breath really ragged and i feel like im suffocating.  I get sleep paralysis too, but mostly only from neg attacks.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Insomnia can often be a natural reaction against trying to go to sleep when you are not tired.
<br>
<br>
There are two basic types of linear time: Cultural Time and Natural Time.
<br>
<br>
People can often get sort-of trapped between the two. In the sense that your natural tendency to want to live in Natural time clashes with the self-imposed requirement to live in Cultural time. This clash, so to speak, can often be manifest into objective interpretations such as "insomnia". There is no actual thing as insomnia, it's just a Cultural Time thing.
<br>
<br>
You could think of it as the very first stages of a spiritual awakening.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

You -do- realize that most other people with sleep paralysis also have an evil presence and fear that accompanies the episode? It's probably the reason you think that there are negs. Hallucinations while in SP are also common.

Ok, this does not describe me.  Insomnia is very real and it is hell, let me tell you!  I am SO, SO tired but I can't sleep.  I've gone for days without sleep.  I've averaged about 10 hours of sleep per week for months on end.  During this time day and night I walk around in a daze.  Sleep researchers have studied this.  It is a true phenomenon.
<br>
<br>
I don't have it nearly as bad as I did when my son was a baby and complicated the situation.  Back then it would take me hours to fall asleep, then he'd wake up, I'd put him back down, and instead of crashing I'd find myself awake for another few hours!  Repeat, repeat, repeat yet again.

I have isomnia my hole life, but it has never bugged me. My body has always lived off little sleep, but when I dream, I get premonitions of the future. I used to sleep deeply but as I got older I am now a light sleeper and sometimes its like I am not even really alseep at all when I am. I have tried pills and such, but they just screw me up. Found that I just cope better dealing with it. However if and when I really need sleep to heal and such, I can sleep along time, its really weird. Doubt this helps much, but hope it does.

no disrespect lines, but I honestly believe that I have negative spirit attachments, or naturally draw them to me.  I guess you may consider them hallucinations, but I dont.  I have awaken to the feeling of someones body sliding around on top of me, feeling their breath on my face, hearing them breath but not seeing them.  I have had my neck forced into unnatural positions against my will so I could be made to face my attacker, then verbally taunted and tortured.  I have felt myself being electricuted to the point of near death, and been wounded physically.  I know in most cases with sleep paralysis its just being awake before your body is, but i assure you, i am the exception to the rule.

You'd know better than I in any case. I was just letting you know that there could be other explainations. SP also sometimes gives people different sensations, I don't know them all, but I think I remember electricity coursing through someone being mentioned before.
<br>
<br>
Myself, I've had an evil-looking dude try to pull me through a wall one night. The person looked real, the hand on the arm felt real, I knew enough about what was happening to know he wasn't there.
<br>
<br>
Do yourself a favour and look up some stuff about sleep paralysis. It's better to have those negs being very powerful illusions rather than real. Not trying to say that I know what you are experiencing, just trying to give you the chance to see what is happening in a different light.

i hardly ever slept for months at home, i always slept at school or during the way a few hours at a time and i said it was insomnia, but i knew it wasnt.. my room is "haunted" or something, and at night while i try to sleep i see what i think are demons. they surround me and are in forms of skeletons and black misty figures, usually... sometimes i even felt them physically touching my skin

Man, I thought I was one of the few out here with a sleeping problem! In my case, it DOES bother me. I noticed my body has low vitality levels wich I'm trying to restore with the NEW system and I'm also open to other options.
<br>
<br>
I'm busy with my own little sleep research and perhaps I should share what I've found out with you guys:
<br>
<br>
<br>
- meditation vs sleep
<br>
<br>
If you want to meditate, you have to CLEAR your mind, right? When you want to sleep however, it seems you need to let your mind wander without taking active part in it. Again and again I notice how true this is and that I suck in NOT taking active part in my inner chatter.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Physical exercise helps a lot.
<br>
<br>
When I'm doing nothing like that for a while, I sleep worse. When I went snowboarding for a week, I slept like a baby. This means I should be working out in such a way that I get tired muscles. A little walking or cycling in steady pace doesn't cut it for me. My dad is a plasterer. He says a man is build to do heavy work, or at least the man with a decent body. He is a very good sleeper and so are all of his colleagues. I don't know how that works for women, but I thought I'd mention it anyway 'cause I do sense truth in it for me.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- steady bedtimes
<br>
<br>
Yeah, old news... and another thing I'm not good at, but it is supposed to matter as well.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- thinking about going lucid, astral projection just before going to sleep
<br>
<br>
This is very bad for a bad sleeper I found. The best thing for me is not to think about these matters at all, IF I want to sleep that is. The danger for me is that I can get to excited about these subjects and think to ACTIVEly about them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- posture
<br>
<br>
When I lay on my back and almost fall alseep (transition stage), I often get a shock of some sort and, for example, my arm jolts upward wich can keep me from falling asleep. I don't seem to have this problem when laying on my side. I also have this when meditating sometimes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
- tension in the head/face
<br>
<br>
I noticed that I close my eyes a little too hard and that my jaw has tension too sometimes. Here's a good and very easy solution:
<br>
When you use good earplugs (I use Ohropax, made of wax) and really seal of the ears, you can HEAR tension in the head. It sounds like low humming noise. So relax your muscles until everything's quiet. Very easy this way.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Probably all old news, but ... It's just my two cents...
