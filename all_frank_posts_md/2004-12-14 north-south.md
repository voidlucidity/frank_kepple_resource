Hey guys, I was just wondering if it is important to lay with your head facing north and your feet facing South to project.

I think it's more of a mental thing.
<br>
<br>
If you believe it, you're gonna' need to sleep with your head magnetic north.
<br>
<br>
I really don't think it matters, like i said, i believe it's more of a mental block.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
In my experience it matters not. If you believe it is necessary then, chances are, it will become necessary for you. Likewise with many other of these small details. I once read a meditation manual that described about how each finger and hand had to be in a certain position together with all manner of other instructions. This was just ridiculous. The only real requirement is to be fairly comfortable, but not so comfortable that you fall asleep. Which is why lying down in your normal sleep position is not a good thing. Far better to sit in a chair if you are prone to this.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Interesting and following on from what Frank has said - a similar question was raised during the recent Robert Bruce workshop. When he explained that he prefers an inclined position in his office chair and that for him a upper body angle of about 45 to 37.4 degrees seems to work very well.
<br>
<br>
Although a few people chose to lie down for most all the practice was done seated in chairs. Some of the group had success with this!
<br>
<br>
Additionally Robert explained that it actually helps to be sightly uncomfortable to maitain some body consciousness. In other words to prevent one from falling asleep and to keep the mind open for memory download etc.
<br>
<br>
When practicing in a seated position during the workshop and on other occasions e.g. easy position - I find that I tend to get astral vision episodes rather than full OBE. On occasion I seem to maintain a sort of dual consciousness i.e of the body and of the location as perceived via extended awareness etc. Although I have had full OOBE whilst seated, but more commonly when prone or propped up at an angle.
<br>
<br>
Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

When attempting astral projecting, I consider laying on my back improtant, not because its the stereotype, but because it keeps me uncomfortable. I hate sleeping on my back. I can only drift off to sleep if I'm super tired.
<br>
<br>
But then, in the mornings when I'm not trying to astral project it doesn't matter what position I'm in, as long as I can catch the razor's edge of opportunity.
<br>
<br>
But for the record, the head of the bed faces NorthWest.
