<section>
I finished reading all of Robert Monroe's books recently and also have been reading Bruce Moen's website.
<br>
<br>
In the early hours of this morning, I had a most amazing experience which I would love to share with you.
<br>
<br>
Here it is.
<br>
<br>
<span class="bbc_color" style="color: darkblue;">
 I was dreaming and became semi-lucid during the dream.  I was OBEing and going through doors and walls.  I went into a room that was full of tables.  Lots of people were sitting at the tables, chatting, drinking and seeming relaxed.  However, the atmosphere was one of
 <i>
  waiting
 </i>
 .  It was a huge waiting room.
 <br>
 <br>
 My conscious brightened here as I realised I was here for a reason, to help someone move on.  I moved through the room, looking for someone who was "out of sorts".  I saw a woman sat at a table on her own.  I approached her and said, "Can I help you?"  She was very hostile and said something like, "No, I'm fine on my own".  I moved away from her and as I did so, another person (young, male) went up to her to ask if he could help her.
 <br>
 <br>
 Then I went to the other side of the room and out into a small corridor.  There were a few people here, and I spotted a man stood on his own, who looked a bit lost.  He had a bottle of beer in his hand.
 <br>
 <br>
 I moved over to him and started a "general" conversation, along the lines of, "Hi, can I help you at all?"
 <br>
 <br>
 He seemed quite genial and said, "I don't really know, I don't know what I'm doing here myself."
 <br>
 <br>
 I then moved back to the doorway by the waiting room and sat next to another man.  I said to him, "It's busy in there, isn't it?"  He responded, "It's always like this in Las Vegas."  This really surprised me.  "Las Vegas?  We're in Las Vegas?" I exclaimed.  "Yes, it's always busy here," he said.
 <br>
 <br>
 I moved back to the first man and said to him in a casual way, "Have you ever wanted to go to Las Vegas?"  He shrugged and said, "Not really, no."
 <br>
 <br>
 Just then another young male came over and stood next to me.  He had a blue t-shirt top on, a very distinct blue.  His top stood out.  He smiled and then said to me, "Oh, you're not ready yet, sorry, I'll just be milling around – call me when you need me."  At this comment, my conscious brightened and I realised he was the Helper who would take the first man onto the next "place".
 <br>
 <br>
 The Helper moved away, but within a comfortable distance.  I could always see the blue colour out of the corner of my eye.
 <br>
 <br>
 I then said to the man, "You were in the hospital yesterday, with some quite serious injuries, and today you are here.  The doctors were doing their best to help you.  Do you remember anything about how you got from there to here?"  He looked at me, trying to remember, but shook his head.  I then said, very gently, "Has it crossed your mind that perhaps you might have died?"
 <br>
 <br>
 He looked at me for a while, absorbing the information.  I sensed he wasn't hostile to this thought.  He then began talking to another woman who was by his side.  I got the impression that she was his girlfriend in real life, who he was creating as a thought form.  He was discussing the possibility of his death with her and she was agreeing that yes, perhaps, it was plausible, it would fit with what had happened.
 <br>
 <br>
 All the time I was talking to the man, I was holding a large bunch of keys and while I was gesticulating with my hands, the keys were rattling.
 <br>
 <br>
 Then another woman was stood by me.  She was very different to his girlfriend and I got the impression she was related to him (sister?).  She was full of grief and said to him, "Will you ask her (meaning me) why?"  I wondered why she didn't ask me directly, as I was standing right by her.
 <br>
 <br>
 I said to her, "I haven't got all the answers, because I'm only human too, but I believe that Mark needs to realise that he's died before he is able to move on to the next place.  Otherwise, he might stay here for a long time waiting for his friends to turn up."
 <br>
 <br>
 I have no idea how I knew his name, it just came out while I was saying it (like the fact that he was in hospital with horrendous injuries).  No-one questioned the name (so I assume it was his name) and no-one asked me how I knew it!
 <br>
 <br>
 Mark was still talking to his girlfriend, and I think they were coming round to accepting the fact that he had died.
 <br>
 <br>
 Just then, I started "fading" and knew I was losing it.  I called telepathically to the Helper that he must come now as I had to go.
 <br>
 <br>
 I then woke up.
</span>
<br>
<br>
I believe that, had I not been reading about retrievals, I wouldn't have realised that the room was a waiting room, and my opportunity would have been missed.
<br>
<br>
I feel really honoured to have helped Mark move on, and a little awed.
<br>
<br>
However, I have a question for those knowledgeable at retrievals.
<br>
<br>
Why do the Helpers need us?
<br>
<br>
I understand why we need them, but not the other way round.
<br>
<br>
Oh, and another question, a bit selfish really, but does anyone know what the bunch of keys was about?  They were very prominent.
<br>
<br>
Cheers
<br>
<br>
Sarah

Hi Sarah,
<br>
<br>
Wonderful post, thanks for sharing... thank you
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
As you know I am more familiar working with communication between the physical and non-physical i.e mediumship. Although I have had the odd recollection of rescue and retrieval type work in that I have been aware of being accompanied by a helpers or guides to certain similar situations (usually disaster scenarios) and been shown the good work that goes on following such events to aid people passing over.
<br>
<br>
More honestly I am not really qualified to give anything approaching an expert opinion on this (regarding myself as a learner). No doubt Frank or someone with similar experience will be more able to proffer a meaningful interpretation for you.
<br>
<br>
Kind thoughts,
<br>
<br>
<br>

<span class="bbc_color" style="color: black;">
 <br>
 <br>
 Sarah: A fabulous account and you did
 <u>
  ever so well
 </u>
 for your first time. I cannot remember my first as I fluffed it so badly!
 <br>
 <br>
 When a person begins this kind of work it can often throw a completely new light on their sense of spirituality. I know it did with me. For the first time ever, I felt my knowledge had some practical and beneficial use beyond me just finding our more about life, myself and having fun. I felt it gave me a definite, tangible connection to the wider scheme of things, together with a distinct sense of purpose.
 <br>
 <br>
 From what you say, it sounds like you were directed to one of the transfer rooms. Here you find people from all manner of backgrounds who have physically died, but do not really have any particular direction or idea about what to do next. Like, they had no particular religious beliefs or any kind of beliefs about an afterlife or whatever. They perhaps were not very fearful about death either. They tend to be the kinds of people who think death is an unpleasant but inevitable fact of life, and that once you are dead that is it. No sense in worrying about it, it is going to happen some time... and all that kind of talk.
 <br>
 <br>
 People in this position can end up in these places, and everyone in the room probably needed retrieving in some way or another. Which is handy for beginners as, chances are, you are bound to connect with someone and experience a successful retrieval. Hence, you were directed there. Given a little more experience, under similar circumstances, you could expect to retrieve maybe eight or nine people before your experience faded.
 <br>
 <br>
 Mark was having difficulty accepting he had passed over. His sister appeared to be trying to get him to say to you he was dead (physically that is). By saying it, he would be accepting it within himself. A person
 <u>
  must
 </u>
 accept this before they can move on. Because it was Mark's continuing none acceptance that was keeping him fixed in that place. People can often be reluctant to accept the position they are in, for various reasons. Normally it is to do with the idea something bad may happen to them: like being sent to hell.
 <br>
 <br>
 The success of any retrieval depends on interrupting the thinking of the person being retrieved. First, you need to find out what the circumstances are by scanning their energetic picture. This should give you basic information of the circumstances that led up to that person's physical separation. I find it best to do this
 <i>
  before
 </i>
 trying to make verbal contact as most of them do not make much sense and it can throw your thinking off balance. Like the chap who thought he was in Las Vegas, and the woman sitting feeling sorry for herself at the table, and so on.
 <br>
 <br>
 First, scan their energetic picture to get the circumstances leading up to their separation. If you cannot get it, mentally reach out for a helper and ask them to give it to you (as it happened the helper took the initiative). Then decide on an interrupt strategy. Lots of people needing retrieval are confused, they do not know where they are; they are milling around aimlessly or sitting self-absorbed. What is happening, in effect, is they are going around the same thought-loop in their mind. Somehow, you have to break that loop and part of their energetic picture should tell you, or at least give you a strong clue as to what it is.
 <br>
 <br>
 The actual approach is up to you, but I find being direct is the way to go. Direct in the sense of telling them early on they have separated from their physical body. I find people in this position suffer two basic problems: 1) they are unsure whether they have died or not, and 2) if they have, then what the heck happens now?
 <br>
 <br>
 So my basic approach is normally designed to clarify the confusion caused by the first instance. Then I immediately follow up with a situation that clarifies the second instance, which normally coincides with the introduction of the helper (or helpers). The nitty-gritty detail of the approach and interrupt strategy will depend on the clues gleaned from the person's energetic signature.
 <br>
 <br>
 Helpers need us mainly as a kind of go-between. The subject is often trying to focus away from his her situation. If you focussed in this way whilst projecting, for example, you would automatically go back to physical. Unfortunately, the person cannot do that.
 <br>
 <br>
 The effect of this tends to dim a subject's awareness of their surroundings to the extent where they cannot see helpers, who are entirely non-physical. However, having a part of you still physical, changes your energy signature entirely, in that it harmonises with that of the subject to a higher degree.
 <br>
 <br>
 In other words, you and a helper could be standing opposite a subject who would see you, but not the helper. As you interrupted the subject and brought them out of their particular mental dilemma, they would then become more aware of their surroundings, and the image of the helper would come into view.
 <br>
 <br>
 As for the bunch of keys, the thought probably came from the helper for some reason. I'm guessing it was to assist the subject to focus in a particular direction. Maybe a bunch of keys was relevant to the subject in some way.
 <br>
 <br>
 HTH, and the very best of luck in your future retrievals.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

<section>
Thank you for your words of support and encouragement everyone.
<br>
<br>
A special thank you to Frank for a very full and detailed response.
<br>
<br>
The experience has changed me profoundly.  At first, I think I was stunned, not only that I managed to help, but also that I was deemed suitable to be a retriever.  As the day went on, I started to feel quite emotional and at times on the verge of tears (and I'm not a weepy person).  I think I was a bit overwhelmed.
<br>
<br>
A couple of months ago, I decided to myself that with all this "spiritual stuff", I would not be willing to accept it unless it came to me in a form that I trusted.  My trusted forms are meditation, introspection, and dreams.  I know that this retrieval, whilst being beautiful on its own, was a "test" for me, to put my money where my mouth was, so to speak.  I'm now opening myself to other world(s)/level(s)/plane(s) - whatever they are (I'm not getting bogged down with "words").  And what is especially nice is that the more I open, the more "enriching" experiences I get.  It certainly beats stumbling around in one's home in the RTZ pushing my arms through walls!!!
<br>
<br>
As you say Frank, it has given me a sense of purpose and knowledge (rather than belief) that death is not the end.
<br>
<br>
What is ironic is that only a few months ago, I would have been in the category of the people in the transfer rooms, i.e. those who believe death is inevitable and so it's not worth worrying about – what will happen, will happen – without any belief about an afterlife.  There's something oddly 'poetic' about my first retrieval being in a place where I probably would have gone after death myself, had I not carried out this retrieval and changed my views!
<br>
<br>
I think I was given a "soft" first time as, to be honest, my subconscious did most of the work.  I'm just glad I remembered it so fully.  I guess my subconscious did the scanning, and informed me of Mark's name and situation as it was coming out of my mouth!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for explaining why the Helpers need little old us.  I understand now.
<br>
<br>
I do hope that this is only the beginning for me.  It was truly a humbling, yet magical experience, and I would dearly love to do it on a regular basis.
<br>
<br>
Thank you again
<br>
<br>
Sarah

<section>
What a wonderful story! and thank you so much for sharing.
<br>
<br>
I truly believe that after reading that, that you have come to be a retriever guide (in training). All guides in the dementions each have special outlets as to why they are there. They need us as a go between because we are planted in the now, and they are there, especially for the ones that have just recently passed and are confused and just waiting for that hand to reach for them.  The most profound book I have ever read had a wonderful retrieval story towards the end that just brought tears to me eyes. In the "cosmic journey" by rosiland mc knight her retrieval of Peter was asstounding. I believe that is one of her true purposes as well.
<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work! They need you

<section>
great job sarah. i would see the keys as the key to knowledge that is forming to you. of becomming a guide in this sence. as a sign that you are the helper here. with out the souls to help a helper has no sence. they too have a job to do and an experienced helper will guide at any time as a beginner. again good for you.
