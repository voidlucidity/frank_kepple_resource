<section>
Our brain's physiology operates on a specific,highly focused frequency of the greater reality.
<br>
<br>
the 'definate' nature of the lower frequency physical universe (versus the higher "subtle realms") also causes it to be limited in it's ability to process and store data (as remarkable as the brain is).
<br>
<br>
however,modern physics tells us that there is no such thing as absolute time,and reality itself is not solid and static,but even the most mundane object is alive with movement-creation and destruction on a faster and larger time scale than our basic perception allows.
<br>
<br>
and I've learned from a guide that time is actually a
<u>
 unified
</u>
phenomenon.time is all one (the future/present/past always exists,and is always evolving).
<br>
<br>
this leads me to the conclusion that time is highly malleable,and I've recently read reports of people that seem to experience "time slips" where they will temporarily slip into the past,and then slip back.
<br>
<br>
do you think,that by a progressive spiritual evolution of our minds,we can harness this ability,and "ride the currents of time" that lay beyond our illusion of linear time?
<br>
<br>
someone,please answer...

<br>
<br>
It seems you're not the only one who has been told this by a spirit! They obviously have a much better grasp on the concept of time than we do.
<br>
<br>
A good explanation I read about how to relate to time is firstly, dont think of it as linear, esp. not in a horizontal direction, but rather vertical, kind of like an office building of infinite height, with an infinite number of floors. All events in time exist at once. We then just perceive events from one floor of that building.
<br>
<br>
Being able to look into past or future isn't a matter of moving forward or backward in time, but learning where the elevator is, and moving up and down to different floors, because we are not looking at different directions in time, we are just looking at different "nows".
<br>
<br>
It can also be said that time does not move, we move through it.
<br>
<br>
I could think about it some more, but if I do, my brain might try to implode!
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

Ahh!!  You're the second person I've heard this from, the first being myself.
<br>
<br>
I have not spoken (or don't remember) with my guides, but when I was maybe fifteen I heard some guy on television (some dumb movie) trying to explain claravoyance as time not being in a line, but a big loop, and a psychic is someone who can see a different part of the loop.
<br>
<br>
That, IMHO, is total BS, but it got me thinking.  What shape would time take?
<br>
<br>
It's a dimensionless dot!  Why?  All I was ever able to explain it as was:  Now is happening right now, but now it's past.  The future is not happening right now, but it will be.
<br>
<br>
That's not a good translation of my mental-ese.  But it's good to hear someone else say this.  I'm also pleased to hear James say this.

Time is extra confusing if you require that events (even in the same place) have a definite order. I have the more flexible view that any event might affect any other. Events dont have to be 100% before or after each other. The part of time we usually see has mostly a past-future order because the future usually isnt connected to the past (that direction) but it could be.

What I find funny is even though we know time does not really exist in the way we think it does, we still use all the time-related words.

I coined my own quote to explain my experiences of 'journeying to previous lives' and other things/places/times.  It goes a little like this, " Time is only relevent to having a perception of it, apart from that it does not really exist."

So, does anyone think that time travel will be possible one day via complex spiritual machinery? Using the analogies from before, it would require moving up or down the "elevator" of the Time Building. Michael Crichton's book, Timeline (i think) had really interesting quantum mechanics and theory.

Funny I didn't require any spirit to tell me this either, I thought about this after watching Inuyasha and how Kagome could go back in time and everything wouldn't change in her time, well that got me thinking that everything that she did in the past already happened and in doing so caused everything in her time to be as it is.
<br>
<br>
I guess this would be something of events not having an order since in order for it to take place, a person from the future would have to be in the past, but how would this be possible if the future didn't happen at the same moment as the past did, see.  I tried explaining it to some people that watch the show, but they just thought I was crazy and said that time can't work like that.

<section>
I'm time travelling at this moment, as are the rest of us, at this moment I am in what the dumiii coins as the present, as we read our manifested thoughts we are travelling back in time to the moment we wrote our thoughts. When we watch a film we perceive something that has already happened, when we read a book we read something what someone is or was aware of, we read their thoughts as they were, therefore we experience the past.
<br>
<br>
All is Light and Thought, the unmanifest and the manifest, matter is manifested thought our bodies are manifested thought are minds unmanifested thought, these words here, manifested thought the word here         ßunmanifested thought. Time doesn't exist and if it did, (if being the non existent word) its because the masses think it does. I myself, view time as manifested thought that the unmanifested thought in all senses of the word chooses to experience.
<br>
<br>
Instead of using the word time I myself prefer moment or incidence. Past present and future are the moment or co-incidences. Time is like a half empty fish tank with a fluid pattern of waves on its surface, we then quickly pour in the other half of the fish tank and a load of fish that are scattered about within it. The waves of the tank become distorted and the pattern looses fluid motion, each Goldfish experiences a different feel to the waves according to its position in the tank. Now from the moment the water was at the beginning in its fluid pattern incident one, and from the moment the water and fish was added, incident two, to the moment the water finally finds and regains its calm fluid pattern, incident three can be called time or moments or co-incidences, however each Goldfish within the tank experiences and rides a different wave and therefore will experience different incidences and therefore a different time, plus it doesn't help that Goldfish swim in circles and have a five second memory. For anything outside tank (outside the incidences) time would cease to exist.
<br>
<br>
Therefore a coincidence (or sync) is a recognised linking co-incidence, so if a dumiii says that your sync was a coincidence they would be just affirming something that ourselves were aware of, therefore they would know not what they do.
<br>
<br>
Therefore one could quite openly claim time to be a matter of co-incidence. Anybody reading this just joined this incident of ours and travelled back in time. Or as it was put, experienced a time slip.

Jason:
<br>
<br>
I think you will find it beneficial to move beyond the old "memories stored in the brain" constructs and think more in terms of mind.
<br>
<br>
The other aspect of your post you might consider is, within objective reality, we experience the passage of time as a succession of moments that flow from future through to past. As such, I think it is stretching the narrative to go so far as to define what we experience as linear-time as an illusion. But I can see where people are coming from when they talk about time in this way.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, time is an action in consciousness that we have created. On that basis, time cannot possibly be an illusion as it does have a reality existence as action. However, it is our
<i>
 experience
</i>
of time that can often appear illusionary.

Even at the beginning of the thread, it was assumed that all of us defined time and travelling through it the same way. There is nothing obvious about it. The words used seem to imply that the past, present, and future are distinct places to which it is possible to travel the way we might get in a car and go from one city to another.

I think some reading material that would help some of you is the Mode Series by Piers Anthony. I remember vividly of a character (forget which books she was in though), but her memory moved backwards through time rather than forwards (so if she had met you, and then you met her again you'd have to reintroduce yourself, because your past is her future and there is no way that she'd know who you are because her timeline operates differently).
<br>
<br>
As for what to do to find this magic 'elevator' of time, how do we know that when we find it that it can't do more for us as well? What happens if we take this elevator and move it sideways too? I mean once we get to that point it seems we're no longer truly operating something similar to an elevator. There is more potential I would think!

Time is a concept defined via the lower mind, which will henceforth be known as the Earthly Mind, don't know what I was thinking labelling it the lower mind. Time itself doesn't exist; to say that time is defined by the constant speed of light is to tell us nothing. But to say time is defined by the speed in which the individual mind decodes light is quite different, for example when we close are eyes and meditate we remove the source of light, and thus the individual mind has less light to decode, the result being time appears to speed up, you may think you've been meditating for 15 minuets were in fact its been 45 minuets.
<br>
<br>
When were having fun were not consciously thinking about anything other then the moment, were flowing, this means that the individual mind decodes light and thought at its full potential.

No, science has discovered that time can be measured in distance, because they can be bent to look like each other. The proportion is speed C. One cycle in a computer takes about 1 foot of time to execute.

the reason why light is called just light, is that there is no state for light. Light has it's own state (there are two states combined in it).

When I say time is time, then I mean that there is no adequate explanation to it.

But since there is no absolute time.. I don't know what are we really talking about here? Time is smth we can only understand by thinking about it as humans. How is time definable at all? Does time exist in other galaxies? And can it exist when there is noone there to witness it passing by?

<section>
There is no adequate explanation for it? What the hell...you seem to forget a specific methodology of figuring something out. To see what something isn't is to see what it is, so there probably have been at least a few disproven theories of time.
<br>
<br>
I know for sure that time isn't defined by the speed of light costant, since there was an article I read last year in Popular Science that stated the speed of light is slowing down. If light isn't traveling at a constant speed anymore, then this idea is basically false now. The definition of time includes this in my mind. And if my mind has the capacity to feel and know that, then Quantum Mechanics states that I am having an effect on it to be true.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion, time is something you yourself know. Just define it for yourself and share with us what you think it is. For instance for me, time is the force that causes me to do anything and not be 'on pause' (where's that rewind button again?). I still see it as a string, but my mind is starting to like the elevator idea. This basically means that I'm saying screw the science and bring on the visualization, and there's the current definition of time from my box. Take it or leave it.

Heres a few things i jotted down in my journal.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Thoughts On Time
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 East/West = Now/Then:
</b>
<br>
Just like east and west time continues... You can travel west forever without an actual destination.
<br>
However, it cant be like north/south cause they are destinations. So time is a direction, not a destination.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Perception:
</b>
<br>
When you're having fun and a good time thirty minutes could seem like five minutes. If you're bored and uncomfortable thirty minutes could seem like two hours. So why cant you stop time all together or speed it up at will using ur perception of it.
<br>
But if you could control your perception then you could change the entire world in your own eyes.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 What If Everything Stopped?:
</b>
<br>
What if the world stopped turning so there was no day and night, all clocks stopped and no one paid attention to time, would it still exist?
<br>
<br>
Or if the world stopping is too much to think about try this. If you were stuck in a room with no windows, no clocks, no calenders... would time still exist for you?

<br>
Time would still exist. Thoughts require some form of passage to measure one from another, the heart still beats, and bodily processes and cycles would continue. For these actions to occur in a percievible sequence would be evidence that 'time' still existed for the observer.
