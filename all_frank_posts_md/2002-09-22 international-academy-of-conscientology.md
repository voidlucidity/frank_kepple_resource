Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
I can see that the organisation located at:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.iacworld.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.iacworld.org
</a>
<br>
<br>
Is the object of some discussion
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
I have added this site to the links database, because first and foremost I do think that they are
<b>
 potentially
</b>
pursuing worthwhile work. In any case, it is for each and every person to decide for themselves of their own freewill.
<br>
<br>
I do have some comments and observations. First, I am fundamentally and completely against
<b>
 any
</b>
Spiritual or Consciousness type organisation that seeks to make
<b>
 any
</b>
commercial profilt. Money is the ultimate symbol of materialism, and which is in turn one of the major factors retarding the progress of mankind in the great scheme of things.
<br>
<br>
If on the other hand no profit is being made or sought, and all surplus cash is translated into further research and enhancement of training and informational facilities, then that is fine providing it stays that way always.
<br>
<br>
My only other comment is that they appear to have contrived a whole new, and complex,  language of their own to describe everything. This is a great concern, in that there is absolutely no reason to mystify everything and steep it in terminology, in order to provide courses to de-mystify it. One has to ask why they have deemed it necessary to do this at all.
<br>
<br>
Spiritual Truths and those of the higher realms and states of consciousness are, or should be, profound, true, real, and unambiguous, and should always remain that way. The focus should be very, very straightforward - the ongoing Spiritual evolution of mankind, and indeed of all life, and their should be no detraction or obstacles to that - particularly in terms of money!
<br>
<br>
I would be interested to get more comments abou tIAC here.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hi all
<br>
<br>
Yes, a couple of questions about this institute for Michael &amp; Goldmundo if you can answer here.
<br>
<br>
You guys were saying this site used to be called IIPC, so just to make sure I'm talking about the same one here as you guys, can you tell me if the information on my link is still relevant? And that it IS the same one as IAC world?

<section>
Hello,
<br>
<br>
Thank you Adrian(and Mobius) for bringing IAC to the discussion.
<br>
I'm glad in trying to inform you the best I can conserning conscientiology.
<br>
Just to remind you that I'll be writing as an conscientiology student and not  officially behalf of the organization.
<br>
<br>
IAC
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.iacworld.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.iacworld.org
</a>
is a new  organization representing conscientiology internationally, where as the IPC continues only  in Brazil.
<br>
So despite of it's website IIPC is no longer International Institute of P&amp;C, just Institute of P&amp;C.
<br>
<br>

 http://www.iacworld.org/English/Publications/BooksInEnglish/ProjectiologySpecialEdition.asp
</a>
<br>
will soon be availabel as a normal edition in the London office, so you could ask  them for more information.

<br>
<br>
This is the case of IAC.
<br>
In our society money is energy and  the use IAC gives to this energy in my view couldn't be more constructive.

<br>
Adrian&lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;My only other comment is that they appear to have contrived a whole new, and complex, language of their own to describe everything.

<br>
You can read the reasons from the web site
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.iacworld.org/English/TheSciencesAndResearch/Terminology.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.iacworld.org/English/TheSciencesAndResearch/Terminology.asp
</a>
<br>
<br>
For me it makes perfect sense.
<br>
<br>
Josemi refered on the topic "CNN article on OBE" that for him IAC seemed sectarian. May be Josemi you could specifie the term sectarian and in what sense IAC is in this category.
<br>
In my opinion the issue multidimensionality itself is sectarian by nature in this society in the same way that  OBES are pathological mind stuff in most academic enviroments. IAC is  an open organization  but conscientiology is simply  imcompatible with  mainstream science concepts on basic human nature, and therefor is a not wanted case in many public sectores of society in this historical time period, but this doesn't certainly make IAC with less credit.
<br>
<br>
Last thought,
<br>
<br>
There's an  expression:' By yourself you go faster, but with others you go further'
<br>
This is what IAC  is about while defending a multidimensional reality over the materialistc one and not just for one owns amusement but taking in consideration a more larger scale, starting in refuting the paradigms of conventional science.

<section>
Greetings Goldmundo,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to convey your views and position on this.
<br>
<br>
I have to say that I am somewhat baffled by the introduction of this contrived  terminology, which might  only serve to confuse people and make them baulk at the whole subject even more - the last thing we need is more creed and dogma generally speaking.
<br>
<br>
We should, in my opinion, be going in the opposite direction, and making thses things simpler to relate to - after all - this is a natural and inevitable progression of the human race we are talking about here, not some esoteric society. This paragraph from the terminology pages, the link to which you kindly provided, illustrates my point:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "Newly created terms can act as a variety of 'shorthand', representing groups of assumptions, ideas and even broad concepts of conscientiology. Utilization of terms such as 'existential maxi-moratorium' allows a new idea or direction of research that may be related to that subject to be discussed or debated without essential meaning becoming lost as a result of the complexities of communicating the detail of that term."
</i>
<br>
<br>
I am not sure that "'existential maxi-moratorium" is "shorthand" or even what it means - although I would welcome an explanation.
<br>
<br>
I am not even sure what "conscientiology" actually is.
<br>
<br>
None of this is intended to be criticism, because everyone can utlise freewill to whatever they deem appropriate, I am rather trying to get to the real agenda of IAC. Anything that genuinly advances our understanding of real and true Spiritual issues is to be welcomed of course.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for clarifying that for me.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to point out though that "Conscientiology" is not a word that is recognised by any dictionary as far as I know, because it, like most other such words used by the IAC has been contrived by them.
<br>
<br>
Parapsychology is OTOH a word you will find in a dictionary.
<br>
<br>
That is the point I am making - we already have words and phrases to describe all of these things, so why contrive a whole new language?
<br>
<br>
We only need a few words to describe all of these areas - e.g. "metaphysics", "meditation" "trance", "altered states", "raised consciousness", "OBE", "Astral travel" etc..
<br>
<br>
My specific observation is that IAC seem to be making concepts which should be as simple and available to all as possible, just the opposite.
<br>
<br>
As I said, I really don't mind what they call their courses and descriptions thereof - it is a free world, and people can use their own freewill to decide whether it is right for them.  Again, I don't have any problem with IAC per se - indeed, I find alot of what they are doing academically interesting.

<section>
Hi All,
<br>
<br>
Conscientiology is correctly defined by our friend earlier but he seems to have made a mistake when saying that it is the same as psychology or parapsychology - I think it would be more correct to note that a consciousness has a mind but is not only the mind, a consciousness is the thing that controls all of these mental pocesses or behaviours - so to only study those things is missing the bigger picture.
<br>
<br>
Psychology could be defined as the science that studies mental process or behaviour, or alternatively as the science of the mind.   Unfortunatley most psychologists adhere to what is a clearly very limited mechanistic, physicalist scientifc paradigm i.e. the physical body is the be all and end all.  The existence of other bodies (more subtle, more complex and more important to increasing the rhytm of an individuals growth/evolution) are largely ignored by psychologists.  Parapsychologists seem to be becoming more and more influenced by conventional science - making it very hard to really make headway in their research.
<br>
<br>
For Adrian, as best as I understand it, an existential maxi-moratorium is an extension to your physical life (a big extension as opposed to a little one or "mini-moratorium") typically afforded to those who have completed all they came here to do in this physical life and who are in a good position to start some other work without having to go through the hassle of dying and getting a new body, learning things all over again, etc, etc..  So it does seem to be short-hand in a way!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Some words are worn out e.g. people "love" pizza or their car i.e. love is now got connotations and meanings that have diluted the original word, hence new words are sometimes a very good thing.  I very much agree that all dogma, ideologies, etc. are repressive and only serve to castrate a consciousness but being scientific, open and flexible is very different to being dogmatic and hence I applaud a mentally intensive and mature approach to some old questions and also I applaud the creation of new things (remember everything was "new" at some time).
<br>
<br>
From what I see of IAC or IIPC research, education, helping people to liberate their minds, and develop themselves seems to be their objectives.
<br>
<br>
 Good energies for your respective work(s).
 <br>
 <br>
 Kind Regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Jeff

<section>
Greetings Jeff!
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forums, and thank you for your excellent opening contribution!
<br>
<br>
Please do not think that I am anti the IAC, because that is not the case at all - if I was, I would not have added their link to the links database here.
<br>
<br>
I can see entirely what they are trying to accomplish, and that is summarised extremely well in fact by the excellent anthropoidal evolution graphic on the home page.
<br>
<br>
What really concerns me though is that Spiritual progression should be a simple concept, (at least), and should be integrated in peoples day to day lives by thinking and doing the right things at all times - the specifics are another discussion. But Spiritual progression to the point of escaping the "wheel of incarnation" by rising to the Celestial planes and beyond is a progression that takes many incarnations, and each minute of each day in each incarnation. It is not something you can go and do a course on, accompanied by a whole new dictionary of words, which might be incomprehensible to many people.
<br>
<br>
Spiritual progression does not just apply to intellectuals, or the wealthy who fancy doing the course from an intellectual or novelty standpoint. I am not suggesting that IAC have that focus at all, but that might be the effect.
<br>
<br>
I would go as far as to say that all of these esoteric, mystical, and occult phrases should go all together, and we should just use plain English. For example the eastern words of "Karma",  "Chakras" and "Prana" should simply be "Cause and Effect", "Centres" and "Vital Energy".  We have to integrate Spiritual progression into every day life in order to make it accessible to every day people - not just those with money who like to impress people with long impressive sounding words.
<br>
<br>
As for "love" - love is a cosmic expression for the most powerful force in the Universe. There is absolutely no other possible word of phrase to be used.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
This is similar to a discussion I was having with my wife yesterday.
<br>
<br>
Anything we do in whatever profession can be made simpler to understand by all if it is put into everyday terms or analogies.
<br>
<br>
Both my wife and I are computer engineers. We spend a lot of our day speaking to users who want to know what is going wrong with their computer, but don't have an understanding of the extensive IT jargon. Both of us do very well in the service side because we both well practiced at demystifying the jargon and presenting the problem to the customer in a way they can understand.
<br>
<br>
There are many people in the IT profession who don't wan't others to understand what it is they do, so they shroud their work in excessive jargon &amp; terminology. Often because of their own insecurities.
<br>
<br>
The metaphysical industry (for want of a better way of putting it) is no different. There are many professional psychics and teachers out there who would be horrified if the average person on the street could understand what it is really all about. What a terrifying thought it would be for them if anybody could do what they do with a some understanding and practice.
<br>
<br>
Such people would really hate this forum.

<br>
<br>
&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psychology comes from the greek words study of the MIND. So unless you MJ-12 are not a convinct materialist who considers mind being the same as consciousness you are confusing consciousness refered as spirit, commonly "studied by" the theologians in academics, and mind  commonly studied by Cognitive psychologists. And this is I presume one reason why parapsychology can´t been very succesfull in capturing the extra-physical phenomenon. You can measure mind procesess but you can't measure extraphysical consciousness with our current technology. This leads to conscientiology as a science in which the individual by self-experimentation is at the same time the subject and the object of research confirming the facts by intersubjectivity consensus, just as many human science do.
<br>
<br>
For this consensus(agreement) to occur you have to be sure the people involved are talking of the same issue. So you have to establish terms which serve iqually all the interested for an effective communication. This means the most precise, universal and objective terms you can come up whit,  depending less on cultural factores and old connotations.
<br>
<br>
Adrian  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;  am not sure that "'existential maxi-moratorium" is "shorthand" or even what it means - although I would welcome an explanation.
<br>
<br>
I am not even sure what "conscientiology" actually is.
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
<br>
<br>
Existencial maxi-moratorium  referes to an complement of our life task, a new oportunity given to fulfiil our existencial program(mission in christian religious terms). For example surviving from an accident  can be considered as an existencial moratorium by the person who experiences it and knows that  it wasn´t  the right time to leave before taking care of some essential things. It can be maxi or mini depending on wheter it is just to acomplish the life task(mini) or to be able to do some extra after a well acomplished life task in order to reduce even more the carma account.
<br>
All this terms originally are in portuguese where they can be connected to become practically like morexis(moratória existencial)
<br>
<br>
And many terms like carma or chakras  don't need to be replaced as they express correctely the cases and are universally consolidated.
<br>
<br>
Talking about spirituality has an religious impact and is deslocated in our modern  technological society(like it or not).

I would say that thoughts and actions count, and how they are outwardly and inwardly expressed in the context of our brothers and sisters, and in Spiritual growth every minute of every day of every year of every incarnation and beyond.
<br>
<br>
As I said, I am in no way critical of IAC, but they should, in my humble opinion, look first towards what they are trying to achieve, which I believe is honourable, and whether the current approach is the best way to achieve it.
<br>
<br>
It is not for me to say whether it is or not - I am merely asking the questions - if I did not think the IAC was genuine in its intentions, I wouldn't bother asking the questions at all  - in this context at least.

Is dogma the stating of an idea as irrefutable truth?
<br>
<br>
In that case, then (no offense, Adrian) :
<br>
<blockquote id="quote">
 <font face='"Arial"' id="quote" size="1">

  <br>

<br>
<br>
sounds dogmatic to me. (Perhaps because I was raised with the belief that we are here for a single incarnation.)
<br>
<br>
However, I am neither pro nor con the website, nor various ideas including reincarnation, though I do shy away from anything that sounds dogmatic.
<br>
<br>
Also, perhaps "together we go further" ( and I DO value input from others), but I can't find it within myself to allow someone else to direct my course. (With the caveat that hopefully I would accept direction from a higher 'being.')
<br>
<br>
In this sense I think going it 'alone' (although hopefully with other friends who are charting similar courses)  is an indispensable part of the journey.
<br>
<br>
Though I really should visit the website before chiming in.

<section>
Although I think that everyone has the right to use his own words and terms I agree with the opinion that the new term "conscientology" is not necessary. Even if it is not the same as psychology or parapsychology it would not be wrong to say that it belongs to them.
<br>
<br>
Parapsychology can be seen as a "part" of psychology as well as psychology belongs to the cognitive sciences. I think it is more appropriate to say "OBE studies" or "higher consciousness studies" instead.
<br>
<br>
The word "conscientology" itself is interesting enough. Try to split it up and you get "con" (meaning "signifying with, together") and "scientology".

Hello Adrian,
<br>
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;&lt;font size=1 face="Arial" id=quote&gt;quote:&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt; I would say that thoughts and actions count, and how they are outwardly and inwardly expressed in the context of our brothers and sisters, and in Spiritual growth every minute of every day of every year of every incarnation and beyond.
<br>
<br>
&lt;hr height=1 noshade id=quote&gt;&lt;/font id=quote&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE id=quote&gt;
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are right, what counts the most are the Ideas and on this basis you don't have keep reminding that you are not against IAC, because I do think that all the people seriously involved with multidimensionality are not against each other in the traditional sense. It is just matter of discordance on the methods to reach the certain objectives.
<br>
I'm convinced that using new terminology will serve in a  long term perspective more efficientely the 'spiritual causes'.
<br>

<br>
Frankly Frank,  I would not expect such an prejudice comment by an goldmember. Maybe you are trying to provoce someone?
<br>
Let me ask you what makes you think IAC is New Age?
<br>
I consider the Monroe Institute to be much more New Age oriented with their commercial products.
<br>
In fact conscientiology encourages people to depend only on their own force of will, not on some artificial supports as the Hemi-Sync technology.

Hi Daniel, welcome to the astral pulse.
<br>
<br>
I don't think that anyone here tries to provoke anyone else, except for when it comes to debate !
<br>
<br>
I can see why conscientology could be viewed as being new-age.....following on from Adrian's comments earlier, here are a couple of terms in the IAC world glossary :
<br>
<br>
Petifree – The intraphysical consciousness who is permanently and totally free of intrusion, and is completely self-aware of being in this condition.
<br>
<br>
Petifreeness – The consciential quality of the petifree being.
<br>
<br>
....and this is just the tip of the iceberg !
<br>
<br>
Now I'm not saying that there is anything wrong in coining a new phrase or word to describe something.....but when you create a whole new dictionary of terms, people are bound to question their validity, and the authority of the "creator" !!
<br>

Daniel: I was neither involved in the setting up of the structure of this site, nor involved in the running of it. Gold Member status is issued automatically when you reach 500 posts. In any event, it has been a long time since I got fooled by the fallacy of thinking that the truth of an assertion depends necessarily on the virtues of the person asserting it. Argumentum ad hominem, as they used to say in Rome.
<br>
<br>
Funny you should mention the Monroe Institute as I am on record as saying I'm not a great fan of them either (all a bit touchy-feely for my tastes). You mention Hemi-Sync and I can wholeheartedly recommend the Gateway Wave1 CD. Looking back through my past posts you will see one of the primary reasons I recommend it, is that it ultimately teaches you to achieve the Focus 10 state *without* use of the CD.

Hello,
<br>
<br>
Adrian thank you for your kind welcome - I would agree with your root idea concerning love - but I think we all need to be very flexible, rational, and logical about things and not let ourselves or our emotions be too attached to things and subsequently cloud more rational or logical thoughts.
<br>
Just to express a simple example of a word that could be used instead of love is fraternity - people please observe your reactions to that suggestion... what does it tell you??
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
The basis of both of these ideas is Universalism i.e. the more universalistic you are the more you love or the more fraternal you are; but one does not swamp you with all sorts of ideas and memories and traumas and emotions when you think of the concept.  I very much like the word love but I think we need to appreciate the consequences of using certain words - everything has energetic repercussions and so starting with a clean slate i.e. a new word sometimes allows people more freedom not less as some other postings imply when talking about dogma.
<br>
<br>
I agree with Adrian and can see no desire from IAC to confuse the issue/ideas for people but more of a desire to lay the ideas clear and clean.  I think that most people/groups in these areas are trying their best but we each need to see what information (or way of presenting ideas) rings the strongest bell with ourselves.  We also need much/more maturity so we do not waste our time with some things of little importance/relevance.
<br>
<br>
Me, I am not going to let the presentation (facade) of anything stop me from getting at, experiencing, and ultimately living ideas that I DISCERN are better or more logical.
<br>
<br>
FYI - talking about words etc. I agree with a previous suggestion that new words need to be found for many things, but proposing and getting these agreed is easier said than done eh!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
To the best of my knowledge there are at least:
<br>
107 synonmyns for "silver cord"
<br>
25 for "chakras" - for example just calling them centers I would suggest is not adequate as that name would lead to many misnterpretations e.g. the pineal gland is the center of the head...
<br>
<br>
Not simple eh, and who is interested in reinventing the wheel when there are so many new things and words to discover!
<br>
<br>
I have experienced enough to know that all consciousnesses are multidimensional and multiexistential - but please don't believe anything I say - use your discernment and decide for yourself whats up.
<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,
<br>
Jeff

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
A point I am endeavouring to make is that Spiritual progression is something that people need to live every minute of every day. It is not something that you can cloak in a whole new language, take a course on, and just "be".
<br>
<br>
It reminds me of those consumer products advertised on TV (on the extremely rare times I happen to have it switched on for some reason), where they try to get people to buy hair shampoos or skin conditioners because they contain so an so ingredient - and rattle off the name of some obscure organic compound, which as like as not is as meaningless to the consumer as to the product itself - but people buy it because it sounds important.
<br>
<br>
Same for margarines, which are sold on the basis that they are "high in polyunsaturates".  People buy it accordingly, but have no idea what a "polyunsaturate" is except for the fact it tastes nice with strawberry jam.
<br>
<br>
Do you see the point I am making? Placing things in a glossy marketing wrapper, and promoting them with complicated language that sounds impressive, does not necessarily mean that they have any incremental  value.
<br>
<br>
Again, I am not doubting the motives of IAC, indeed I don't confess to understand what they even are,  but if the issue is Spiritual progression, and raising the consciousness of mankind, then only each and every individual can progress that with age old wisdom and truths, and with the everyday help of their brothers and sisters, both incarnate and in Spirit, leading by example in day to day life - fancy words are simply not necessary.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Okay, too strong expression from my part, but that wasn't the point of my post anyway, which asked inicially you to tell us what makes you think that conscientiology is New Age. So for you to be coherente with your affirmation above you could tell the fundaments behind your' true' assertion that conscientiology is 'New Age blurb' and not just participate by yawning.
<br>
<br>
By the way, if Monroe Institute is touchy-feely for you (I agree) then you ironically might just  be interested on the conscientiological approach.

Hi Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Some points -
<br>
Age old truths clearly are not that efficient at helping people to evolve ... Exhibit A being the state of our planet and the lack of evolutionary maturity and intelligence exhibited by nearly all of us.
<br>
<br>
I very much agree that some words are rubbish and the work of marketers, etc is often nothng more than manipulation of people but I think its important to remember the idea, that things presented in a scientific way are actually more likely to have validity in the eyes of the "general" public (sooner or later - if the ideas can stand on their own feet) - and we all want to help as many people as possible right.
<br>
Therefore using a scientific appoach and the necessarily big, fancy (but accurate) words which that entails could be considered a particularly intelligent and non-imposing approach - when the objective is to help the growth and development of as many people (consciousnesses) as possible in as clear and non dogmatic way as possible.
<br>
<br>
I agree that it is the responsibility of the individual to grow themselves and of course to incorporate new ideas into themself in a personal, intimate, integral and consistent manner i.e. I have absolutely no desire to live in a world of clones - and I think the greater maturity ends up developing people who are trying to be more the same as everyone else but who end up being more and more unique because of it !
<br>
<br>
So when talking - we talk, we chew the fat, we use common language, we talk about love but when trying to propose new ideas, new approaches to the wider community and in a way that can not be dismissed off-hand (by most e.g. many mystical or religious approaches) I think getting scientific is good and then of course we let peoples interpretations be as rich and individual as they will inevitably be.
<br>
<br>
Best of energies for you work.
<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,
<br>
Jeff

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
These things might well be correct, but at the final analysis the simple truths should stay that way - simple. As I said before, if the human race has to evolve collectively, and globally, it will have to do so by embracing spiritual truths and living them every day of every life. One of the first stages is to demonstrate the continuity of the Soul/Spirit after the death of the physical body, and assist people to realise that they are actually eternal beings, and most importantly that physical life, and how they live it, is extremely important to their eternal progression.  It is much easier to progress by gaining experience in the physical world, than it is in the Astral or Mental worlds - that is one reason why people incarnate using their own freewill.
<br>
<br>
We have to consider over 6 billion people here - many of which to not have much if any money, or the ability or the inclination to learn big words.
<br>
<br>
As I keep saying - I am not negative about the IAC.
<b>
 Any
</b>
organisation that is
<b>
 genuinely and sincerely
</b>
involved with the  Spiritual progression of mankind,
<b>
 without any material or selfish motive
</b>
is to be welcomed.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I thought you had already conceded to this, when you said the Monroe Institute was more New Age than yourselves. Which is why I pushed the subject aside and moved on. As for your second question, I made my opinion clear in my original post which does not need restating.

 Sorry, expression error again from my part. What I ment was that  when Monroe Institute makes part of the New Age commercial movement Conscientiology makes part of Consciential Age movement  that also recognizes a coming time period when most of humanity will be conserned with their Consciental evolution.
 <br>
 I don't feel comfortable in insisting on this but I do believe there's is a great  diference in a discussion forum like this between stating an opinion with or without justifications.

<section>
Hi All, this is my very first post, so I hope I get it right!
<br>
<br>
By way of introduction, I've been interested in OOBE's for a while now (but have only had one), spurred on by RB and my partner, who this post is really about.
<br>
<br>
My partner was heavily involved in the IIPC for quite a while. They have (or had?) offices in various major cities where they would give lectures on various mataphysical topics. On the plus side they were very straightforward and advocated an approach where crutches and new-age woolleyness were left behind and personal experience was valued more than anecdote. What they could teach was quite advances and she learned a lot in the time she was with them. She spent  time in the London and New York offices helping with translation and giving lectures, but the problems started when she went to Brazil where the main office is based. Unlike the two offices she worked in previously, the Brazil office was run like a cult. The behaviour of the officials there eventually led her to leave IIPC for good, which she was not too happy about.
<br>
<br>
As regards the extended vocab used by the IIPC, from their point of view, I think it was designed to be scientific and something that could be used internationally, aiding in the ease of translation of their books. Equally though, it just looks like the jargon that many cults use to help seperate their members from the rest of the world.
<br>
<br>
I don't know much about the difference between the IAC and the IIPC, but it is certainly best to be open but cautious.
<br>
