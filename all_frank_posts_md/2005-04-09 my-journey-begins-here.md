<section>
i've visited these forums a few times but hadn't signed up until now.
<br>
<br>
a few weeks ago while looking for a technical book in the bookstore this huge shiny book caught my attention. someone had placed MAP in 90 days in the computer manual section...i picked it up and had a look through it.
<br>
<br>
so here i am with my very own copy (which wasn't cheap). i started week one a few weeks ago but had to postpone the project for a while but have set a goal for myself to begin again on magnetic dragon (dreamspell).
<br>
<br>
i have only had one true OBE that i can remember. i didn't travel out of my body but i did find myself turned around facing the opposite way as i lay there snoozing, i guess (fell asleep while staring at a candle flame). i could see the fabric of the couch, but my vision switched letting me see straight through the wall and i could see people outside walking around.
<br>
<br>
i panicked as i realised i could see through things...lol...i struggled for a few seconds to turn my body around but i had paralysis. i don't remember feeling anything after that but all of a sudden i was lying there, staring at the candle again facing the right way!
<br>
<br>
<br>
that was a long time ago, maybe 10 or more years but the experience has always stuck in my mind. i've always been interested in dreams, lucid dreaming, OBE, the unexplained, RV and all kinds of 'paranormal' things...though they seem more normal to me nowadays and not so much paranormal.
<br>
<br>
i keep a dream journal over at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///dreamofpeace.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 dreamofpeace.net
</a>
and i've also set up a custom database-driven journal on one of my websites to record my 90 day MAP journey. i'll post a link to it once i begin (magnetic dragon - april 14).
<br>
<br>
reading all the successes in the forum on this technique i can't wait to get started and see some results!

Hello reality.failure
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Forums. Â Seems like MAP was determined you were going to buy it, it being in a different section waving at you!
<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy yourself here and we look forward to hearing about future experiences...

<br>

<br>
i even looked for other copies in the store and there was none...so it definately wanted to come home with me.
<br>
<br>
thanks for the welcome. i will post any major achievments in the MAP forum...hopefully there will be many.
<br>
can't wait to get started again.
