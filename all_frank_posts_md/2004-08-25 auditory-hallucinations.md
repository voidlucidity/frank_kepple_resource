last night i was trying to project. after about 10 minutes i had that strange wave sensations where i think you get to trance or focus 10. soon after i was listening to the soft buzz of the silence when i heard a low, older male voice that said "hey" in my ear twice! it scared me so much, ive never had an auditory hallucination before and i hope i never do again lol. it ruined the attempt. it just sounded so close. are auditory hallucinations rare? and if so do you ever not get starteled by it? i just really thought someone was behind me talking in my ear, of course when i turned around i was alone.

hmmm, you said it was in the F10 state. im not sure about how rare they are but I read auditory hallucinations accurr when your in the hypnopompic state which is the state between sleeping and waking up.
<br>
Also i am pretty sure they startle everyone unless the voice was soft or just low toned then noone is really bothered by it. who was in the house with you? maybe someone was callin you out into the astral.
<br>
<br>
these are all i have for answers right now. i hope i helped some.
<br>
Thanks, T_Kman0610

Robert Bruce said in his book, Astral Dynamics, (I forget which page) that those voices are just hallucinations and to simply ignore them.

I've experienced many different types of auditory hallucinations (including my own name being called) while meditating, trancing, raising energy, or during sleep paralysis. Like Kodemaster said, they can be safely ignored as distractions. Think of it as a test of your concentration.

I would not say they are rare, and like your experience, they can be quite frightening.  Just the other night I heard a woman speaking to me in a very angry voice.  When I stood up to her and confronted her attitude she became even more enraged and louder.  This terrified me, because she in no way backed down.  However after pondering it a little further I realized something.  Take into consideration that this is my own experience.  I normally attempt lucid dreams in the morning when my body is most receptive to the event.  I awoke very early and attempted a lucid dream, which is when the auditory event occured.  Now, though it was very audible and clear to me, there is probably a 99.9% chance that it was not audible in real time and real reality.  This leads me to believe that I was half asleep.  I was aware of laying in my bed in my room and there was blackness, no dreaming taking place.  It was as if I was beginning to fall asleep but not quite there yet, when I heard the voice.  After the scary experience I immediately became fully concious, realizing that I was only half concious at that time.  It's very possible that auditory hallucinations are nothing more then the body being half aware and half asleep, and therefore, though no visuals or dreams are occuring (at least in my experience), you still "hear" in the dream state.  In any case, from what I know now I don't think it has anything to do with OBE or spiritual entities, but simply the subconcious mind and the concious mind melded together in the process of sleep, which in a sense is all a lucid dream really is.  In this state there are sometimes instances when one is able to recognize audible sounds in the dream environment, though they are not fully dreaming.  I've heard they can be pleasant, or nightmarish, just as dreams can be.  In any case, I truly believe it's a dream state, and not an OOB or elevated state of being in the spiritual realm.

They are very common around the Focus 12 state. You can also hear all manner of pops, bangs, whistles, knocking sounds and Velcro-like tearing and wrenching sounds. Together with people calling your name or just all kinds of shouts, or whatever. Some people get it more than others, but it's just normal at the beginning stages of projection.
<br>
<br>
You can also hear music. Many times in the early years I got up and searched about the house for a radio I thought was left on. Or I've gone downstairs thinking someone was knocking on the front door. Another one I'd get is the sound of a door slamming shut. But after a while you just get used to them all and it hardly happens now. It's just a stage many people go through which seems to go away once you get used to it.

I experienced my first auditory hallucination recently, happening right about the same time as I was reaching the point of getting hypnogogic images. For me it was just a very loud pop. I knew what it was, but my thoughts were "Ohmigosh, for a hallucination that's pretty darn real."

This thinking it is so real, tends to throw people at first. They get the idea that non-physical realms are kinda hazy, whacky sort of places. And some are, I agree. But once you get through the beginning phases you should begin to perceive everything just as clear and lifelike, and as "real" as you do while physical (later even more so).
