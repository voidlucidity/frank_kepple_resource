<section>
I found out about AstralPulse because funnily enough of a guy name Oazaki.  I am not a friend of his but I saw his post and wanted to know more about him.  I wanted to see what his character is like and apparently he is not much liked here.
<br>
<br>
What is there to know about me? I really don't know how to do this properly because I don't like revealing about myself that much because well its just uncomfortable.  Plus it makes me look all vain and egotistic.  I really don't know much about being psychic.  I am a bit of a skeptic in that topic but yet at the same time not.  Its sort of complicated.  Currently I seem to get excrement loads of visions, dreams, and picking up people's thought.  From that alone I can tell that either I am a prophet or extremely nutty or at least getting there.  Hopefully I will learn more here.  There is a problem I need solve though.  A friend of mine is an empath and she is feeling a little too much.  She doesn't know how to block the empathic thingyjig.  Oh yeah I am not talking about myself because I am a guy and I get more of the mental excrement than the emotional excrement thats been happening.

How he could be liked here if he talks about killing moderators? One good thing about him is that he has been converted to the Satanism recently(I probably helped in this process
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
), and probably he'll learn what he can and can't do....
<br>
PM me if you want to know what he also did...

I was also somewhat skeptical, before I started using magick with good results. Now I am 100% sure that reality can be altered by mind, and I've proved that OOBE's are real too.

You will find out a lot about Mr Oazaki's claims this coming Saturday at 16.24 CET. Hint: male cow excreta. :)
