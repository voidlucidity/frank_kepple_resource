Well, I haven't really consciously projected as of yet, but this morning and recently I've been trying to "tranquil state of mind" thing.
<br>
<br>
This morning I was doing that and it was working, I felt vibrations and had hypnogogic or whatever images(which looked very real).
<br>
<br>
Anyways, how come sometimes you can hear radio stations? As the vibrations started, it started low, like an alarm in another room, then it got louder. The second time, I didn't hear it. But, why ? How? It's weird.
<br>
<br>
The images were cool, looked pretty real.
<br>
<br>
I"m just ranting. Sorry.

Because within the Astral there are radio stations, TV stations, books, newspapers, magazines, and a whole load else besides. If you have a favourite piece of music, for example, simply become open to it, while on the Astral, and it will begin playing. Same is true with anything else you want to see, hear, experience, etc. Or if there is nothing quite to your tastes, in *whatever* it is you want to experience, then you can create it (as you think so it becomes *literally* in glorious 3D Technicolour).

i wonder if permanent residents of the astral plain have an equivilent of radio/tv or whatever where the get music and news etc. Think then could we pick it up in our minds? all you need to do is tune in, we might all be tuned in but not know about it!

I'll be damned- I also have the radio/tv phenominon. And I've had it since I was little.
<br>
It used to wake me up as a child and I'd go room to room asking who had the radio on and could they turn it down so I could sleep. Of course, there was no radio.
<br>
They always told me it must be the radio's from cars outside on the street.
<br>
In fact this happened to me again the other day.
<br>
I'm happy to find it so common. Makes me feel a little less crazy.

Everything that we have on the Physical plane is the physical equivalent of its Astral counterpart. (The Physical is not an origin but an end result.)
