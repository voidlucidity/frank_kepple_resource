Hey all. I'm pretty much back online. I've done most of the work on my book thus far, and it's all downhill from here. Here is an article I'm priting up and selling to help develop the cash for my books. Check it out...

<br>
Around 1986 A.D...
<br>
Lying on the... ceiling???
<br>
<br>
F
<br>
ollowing the time of my flying dream episodes another peculiar thing happened. I would experience feelings of floating up and also of falling down- as if being dropped from great height. I'd fall and there would be a great commotion as I landed, my physical body shaking vigorously and abruptly for a second or two. Sometimes the fall would be at the end of a dream in which I fell from a building, or off of a cliff. Yet that didn't explain the floating sensation.
<br>
Without giving much thought to the fact that I didn't see any scenery, or experience any of the movement control usually associated with my flying, I just assumed and accepted that it was just another one of my flying 'dreams,' and went with the flow. When the most memorable part happened, the falling as if from a height, I just left it as the enigma that it was at the time. This soon changed.
<br>
One morning in particular I was enjoying this floating sensation, yet with more awareness than usual.  At a certain point of lifting I stopped rising and heard an unusual sound. It resembled the sound of a helicopter propeller except for that it went slower- "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh" the sound went- over and over again. I was just floating stationary, with this "whooshing" sound happening around me and through me at the same time, and out of what was maybe curiosity, (and to make sure that I wasn't in danger), I decided to see what was going on.
<br>
I opened my eyes to see that I was at the ceiling. The ceiling was only a few inches from my nose, directly in front of my face. I looked to the right to see the source of that sound. The ceiling fan was on, and its blades were going directly through my body! In shock I turned my head downward to see a lump on the bed, covered in sheets. My physical body! I was floating in mid air, only a few inches from the ceiling, and in a body that felt as 'real' as my physical body! And my physical body was still on the bed, lying asleep!
<br>
I panicked- and rightfully so, I'd say. I felt myself take a large gasp of air, and I instantly fell back down to my physical body, with a cluster of fierce jerks upon landing. It was as if every muscle of my body decided to do the twist... but with not even a hint of unison. As I lay there I pondered in awe, and from that point on I knew what was happening when I 'fell.' I actually fell back into my physical body.
<br>
Interestingly enough these floating and falling episodes happened many times. I began to experience it after I heard a metallic 'click' in my head, which is what I now know to be a common precursor to out-of-body travel. The 'click' would happen and then I would go nonphysically floating up off of the bed, lying plank like a stiff board, and in a body that I'd swear was my physical body if I didn't know any better, as the nonphysical bodies are so 'solid' and real.
<br>
I'd hover until I panicked and fell back down, or if I remained calm, after an indeterminate amount of time, I'd simply hover back down just as slowly and smoothly as I'd hovered up. I eventually got used to it, so that it got to the point that I'd just wait in the air for something to happen. I'd always just hover for an indeterminate amount of time and then slowly hover back down to my physical body. I'd hear that same metallic click as I landed back on the bed and back into coincidence with my physical body.
<br>
Sometimes though the 'click' sounded more like a shotgun being fired. I got used to that too, and soon it'd gotten to the point that I'd lie down and nearly immediately hear a click or bang in my head, and then I'd go effortlessly floating up, without the slightest twinge.
<br>
<br>
A
<br>
repercussion, as it is called, is actually a common occurrence in out-of-body travel. Do you ever remember feeling as if falling from a great height while your physical body is sleeping? Do you recall floating sensations? Chances are that you were experiencing this same phenomenon. We are all nonphysical beings, taking on a physical body... a physical vehicle.

Still Getting Used to Moving
<br>
Day 9
<br>
Session 17- an elongated session
<br>
Sunday, March 16, 2003, 2:42 AM
<br>
Projection Journal 1
<br>
<br>
I
<br>
started off not even drowsy. I'd been doing some intense online study into astral projection and etheric projection, and out-of-body experience; being so dearly thankful for the Internet, and for the openness of people around the world.
<br>
<br>
Sequence:
<br>
-   Affirmation: "I can easily out-of-body"
<br>
-   Monroe Affirmation (said aloud and intently)
<br>
-   E-work: Full-circuit with some free-style
<br>
-   4-2, trance
<br>
-   Tense-Release/Heaviness
<br>
-   Move/Test
<br>
<br>
Start: 3:00 AM
<br>
Actual Start: 2:55 AM
<br>
Alarm: 6:00 AM
<br>
<br>
I
<br>
wrote "I can easily out-of-body" in my journal several times, until I was satisfied. I then did the sequence in the order outlined. During meditation I got REALLY relaxed. (By they way, my stomach was empty and asking for food a bit.) My entire body was progressively relaxing and releasing more and more.
<br>
During relaxation practice I wasn't sleepy at all, and was getting restless. My body was just starting to get a bit heavy, and undergo the changes- but so was my restlessness. I decided to take a break and make sure I remained relaxed, and go back to practice later while fresh. At 3:35 AM I ended and I went online and chatted with Ellen a bit, while surfing the web and chilling out online.
<br>
About and hour later, at 4:40 AM, I started practice again. I was sleepy- good and sleepy- and decided to reengage practice from heaviness. I went directly to relaxing, intent on making my body feel heavy- which was at the end of the sequence of techniques. It worked well. J
<br>
I lay down and started the heaviness. Unlike last time though, I wasn't 'willing' the heaviness, but allowing it. It was more of allowing heaviness to take its hold, becoming heaviness, rather than willing it or forcing it. I sort of relaxed and released, and let my physical body go. It made me think of Draja Mickaharic.
<br>
I continued to relax and let go this time- intent to continue until the alarm went off. I'd get specks of something on my screen (the area seemingly behind the eyelids) here and there. I continued, same thing, and I got to a point in which my body started to go to sleep. I guess I won't know for sure unless I get an EEG machine, but I'd say that my body was going to sleep. The sleep started taking over my body. It felt like what I felt in Session 8- that 'different' feeling. My heart area felt like it was collapsing a bit, and my breathing was getting difficult, both seeming to interfere with the process. I continued to let go and let my body reach the heaviness- hence the sleep. I reached a point to where the imagery started to come. It was light, and I started focusing on it- intent to increase it and repeat a Session 8 occurrence. Focusing on it in this way was counterproductive though, so I backed off and continued the relaxation/heaviness exercise.
<br>
I ignored the imagery and paid all of my attention to completely and listlessly relaxing my physical body. I wanted neither sensory input from it nor signal being sent to it. I was shutting down shop- as far as the physical body goes. I needed to get more comfortable somewhere within the practice, and put my left leg so that my knee was in the air and bent, bringing my left foot closer to my buttocks and the sole of that foot flat to the floor. I put my hands above my head with my fingers nearly interlocking. I thought that I might spontaneously move nonphysically without realizing it. If I did I would most likely move to my normal position of lying flat, or another position. If I snapped back into this new position, knowing that I last moved into another position, I'll know that I successfully displaced.
<br>
I got to a point to where the imagery came but was light and kind of far away, like how when focusing on my etheric body during the imagery/dream in session 8 the imagery seemed to move away. Focusing on my etheric (nonphysical) body from the start caused it the imagery to start and stay in the far field it seems.
<br>
I continued focusing and I fell into a dream. I was dreaming a light, at-a-distance seeming dream- as if I was looking at a monitor or screen.  What alerted me this time was that my etheric arm was up in the air, or was rather floating in the air- though at first I thought it to be my physical arm and wondered to myself why (and how, since I didn't put it there) was it in the air. During the part of the session where I was letting go of my physical body I was thinking about a post I read online, where a guy wondered why his arm was up in the air. I started then to think of floating upward at that point- reasoning that this may cause a separation. Did the reading of that post have an influence upon this experience, helping me to repeat his experience here? And did thinking of floating up have an effect?
<br>
When I realized that this was my nonphysical arm in the air I knew that I was separated. I started to move, turning my left etheric shoulder over to the right- thinking that if I turned my etheric self stomach down, with my physical body still on it's back, I'd have a less chance of accidentally re-coinciding. I still turned with too great a caution a though.
<br>
My etheric arms were weightless and had anti-gravity to them, as if balloons were holding them up at the wrist; and it felt like I was under water. I got the upper half of my etheric body- it seems from the torso up- turned downward. It was like my upper body was floating, and I was just leaning my weight toward my right side in order to edge myself to turn that way and flatten out all the way belly down. It was a very weightless feeling. I did manage to stay 'out' a bit longer than in session 8 though. I just need to remain cool and calm.
<br>
After I was back in my physical body I could still see... 'something.' It may have been that I was seeing through my eyelids the curtains and the faint sunlight coming through them. Could I have then rolled out of my physical body??? Writing in my journal afterwards, kneeling down with my sheet over my shoulders, I felt coolness flowing through my back, moving around. I think it even expanded beyond my back area. It was nice.
<br>
***Did this experience imbue me with some kind of strange energy???
<br>
***During this experience I was sleepy/drowsy and on an empty stomach.

You as well Terry... you don't happen to be moving house do you?
<br>
<br>
I'll be doing just that in a couple of weeks which will no-doubt cause no end of upheaval to my routine. So I'll be a tad quiet on the posting front, until my wife and I make sense of it all.

When my wife &amp; I moved house last November we made sure the PC was one of the first things functional, but then we're both in the IT industry (and both nerds).

Frank, I hope your move is trouble free and the weather clear.

I'm moving, sort of. It's temporary due to some work I need to do.
<br>

Maybe I could get a multimillion dollar contract in some remote island.[
