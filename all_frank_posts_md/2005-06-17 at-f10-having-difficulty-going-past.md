Hello...
<br>
<br>
I've read just about all of Frank's posts on phasing and the newsletters.  However, I wanting to see what people do practically speaking to get past the physical.  When I haven't fallen asleep... I seem to get to a state of seeing images like you would describe would be in your imagination... and yet a large portion of what I see is what I'm sure is just blackness of my eye being closed.  I have not been able to make it past this stage yet.  I guess what I'm trying to achieve is a transition to F2.  I can't seem to get my eyes to "turn off" so to speak so that I can try either Frank's noticing idea or something of repetition.  Any response would be welcome
<br>

mm, I wouldn't think of it in terms of turning off your eyes.. rather, turn them on!  Just relax and just let whatever you see flow.  Get creative.  Whatever shapes you see, try and imagine what they could be...at the same time realizing that there is no wrong interpretation.

I understand there is no wrong interpertation.  what I seem to be having difficulty is keeping my body from interupting any progress I may have.  Usually it is my eyes wanting to see things either in my imagination or F2 or something like that that keeps me grounded in F1... where as I am aiming for a pure F2 experience.

Also if you practice too much and you became discouraged because of no results, take a few days off, give your mind some time to not think about it.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
In the early days the moment I'd see an image in mind, my physical eyes would suddenly "wake up" and try to snatch a glance at whatever it was. Of course, that would zap me right out of the state I'd just spent 30-40 minutes developing. I've said before that often I'd feel like gouging my eyes out in frustration. :)
<br>
<br>
A key to all of this is getting the physical eyes to relax and soften. So you are not actually looking out of them anymore. When you first close your eyes, you'll still be looking out of them. So you need to let them relax so they just hold still in whatever position they feel comfortable. Mine tend to drift upwards and there is a point of rest that they naturally go to that is the same each time.
<br>
<br>
This relaxing of the eyes, coupled with the relaxation of the physical body is what allows the focus of attention to move away from the eyes so you can change your mental focus of attention into your mind. The physical is our Primary Focus so you need to try to seduce that focus of attention away from the physical, as I was talking about in a couple of posts over the past week. Once you break the connection to the physical, you are free to look into your mind. As I say, that is when the lights come on, in a manner of speaking, and all kinds of weird and wonderful imagery comes about at the beginning of Focus 2. If you wish, you can you pass through this stage and reach Fz, which is your gateway to Focus 3. Fz is Focus 21 of the Monroe model and Focus 3 encompasses Monroe Focus states F23 to F27 inclusive.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

thanks for the replies... yes I'm aiming for F3 but I think F2 could be a place to start.  When you all think of going inward what exactly do you think of? simply inward? or more?

I've been using the Monroe Wave I series for the past couple weeks and have found it excellent as a way for myself to achieve Focus 10, something of which was very hard for me to do before. The exercises help keep my mind from wandering off like it normally does. It's a little pricey (which is why I held off for so long) but found it to be totally worth it.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I am pleased you like the Wave 1 CD as I too found it very useful in getting over a little hurdle I was having. It cut my time down to getting to Focus 10 considerably. Once at Focus 10 everything just lights up for me and I make the progression no problem. But originally I was finding it difficult achieving a good fix on the Focus 10 state. The BIG downer, of course, is the price, which stops me from actively recommending it to others. Unfortunately, the CD is by no means certain to work. I'm not sure what the general statistics are but it's a lot of money to take a chance on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I can see where you are coming from but I am not sure if it is just the actual "frequencies" on the CD. What I found very beneficial was the guided rundown. It was just what I needed at the time. I have tried a couple of other CDs that had a load of buzzing sounds but they just got on my nerves. All the buzzing and stuff just drove me nuts.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, with the Gateway Wave 1 CD the accent is more on the discipline side of things and getting the mind focused on the task in hand. The actual "hemi-sync" side in terms of the various tones that are presented to each ear, and all that brainwave blah, blah, blah, is well in the background, which is nice, IMO.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
