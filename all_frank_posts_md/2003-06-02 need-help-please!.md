<section>
I am new to the OBEs and I need a bit of help and guidance from people who are more efficient and experienced with OBEs.
<br>
<br>
So far I have had two OBEs. Both lasted about 10 seconds each. After the vibrations I was successful at separation, but was unable to establish clarity or control. I used the techniques described in "Adventures Beyond The Body" by William Buhlman and tried saying commands such as "clarity now" and also "control now" but was unsuccessful at creating neither.
<br>
<br>
When I willed myself towards the ceiling, I went at a higher speed than I wanted and I saw my room from above (in 360 degree vision; extremely weird). I thought "stop" and I did stop. Then everything went dark. I thought of my body and felt the vibrations again. Then, I was bouncing in and out of my body because I would feel the vibrations, then they would go away, then I would feel them again about four times, all within a period of about one minute until I finally woke up in a dream (non-lucid but very vivid). Has anyone had such an experience and is there a better way of coming back? What other techniques are there for control and clarity?
<br>
<br>
Also, I don't know how to initiate the vibrational state. In my first OBE I used a Lucid Dream to get to the OBE, and the second time I felt myself sinking into my bed and recognized this as a pre-occurence to an OBE and that's how I started feeling the vibrations. I used the techniques from the book I mentioned above, like to repeat to yourself as you are falling asleep that "I am now Out-of-body" until your body goes to sleep. But it has not worked. I usually give up after a half hour because I get sore from laying on my back. Are there better techniques? Please share!!!
<br>
<br>
One more question. What is the best HemiSync CD to listen to to initiate OBEs?
<br>
<br>
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSES. IN ADVANCE!!!

I tried that once... once. It didn't work. It could be because I didn't really expect it to. Maybe if you put all your heart into it. I learned from the Mysticweb people that you can help your clarity in OBE by practicing being dynamically aware in the physical, which carries over to the dream and OBE state as clarity and awareness.

Yes. All of my first OBEs I would float out of my body to the ceiling, after hearing a click or gun shot in my head. I say just take slow exits. That helps me keep control. Maybe instead of willing to float roll out, and get up like you would physically. Then already you have more control. See above for clarity. [

Good show. If I just relax, and focus on my heart, or a chant (Such as "I am now out-of-body"), or just relax into sleep, they come on their own. It's natural. If you try to hard or stress about it you keep them away. You have to focus. Let your awareness be quiet, and your thoughts centered and focused. Then they come so fast that it's a shame (that you tried so hard before. [:O]). Do just what you're doing and instead of chanting you can lazily focus on your heart, or count down from 50-1, or just relax into sleep. These are what I am mostly working on. I read somewhere where someone used the "99 bottles of beer on a wall song." [:O]

*SCREEEEEECH!!!!* (Like a car coming to an immediate halt!

Must recant my previous stance. I read a reply to my other post, and thought about it, and connected with my Helpers, and have changed my liflong strike against the brain stuff. (I'm not throwing away my computer. [see 'Delta is OBE' thread. Long story])
<br>
<br>
Well. If I were to suggest something I'd say Delta Brainsync. Delta is OBE. I have one the way. With my skill combined with those I should be

It's very early days for you, and the difficulties you are experiencing are ever so normal.
<br>
<br>
Astral projection is an activity which requires a high degree of mental control. Which does take practice to achieve. Okay, you may be lucky and find you have a knack for it. But it seems most people have to practice for a number of years in order to develop their abilities.
<br>
<br>
What you are experiencing is what I call the Fish Out Of Water Effect. It is caused because when we project, we don't suddenly develop some super sense of conscious awareness all primed and geared for Astral use. The sense of conscious awareness we take with us to the Astral, is exactly the same as the one we have while Physical. Which means we tend to behave like a fish out of water for the first however-many times we project. The actual number naturally varies depending on the innate abilities of each individual.
<br>
<br>
From my early experiences what I would advise is, upon finding yourself "out of body" (to quote a popular description), first practice becoming mentally still. People flit about here and there because their thoughts are flitting about here and there; people lack clarity because they are experiencing mental confusion (which is why lack of sight is very common at first).
<br>
<br>
I haven't read the book you mention. Though I have read about this notion of giving yourself some kind of mental command several times before. It can work because, I suppose, with some people it could well be that a sharp instruction to themselves would be enough to bring their thoughts to order, so to speak. At which point they would achieve the desired effect. But the actual command
<u>
 in
</u>
<u>
 itself
</u>
achieves nothing.
<br>
<br>
The basic problem comes about because a person is entering a realm where thought equals direct action. Which is why having a high degree of control over your thoughts is
<u>
 vital
</u>
. People whose experiences consist of a smooth and controlled forwards progression: do so because their thoughts are flowing in the same highly-controlled way.
<br>
<br>
In other words, your experiences are basically a reflection of your own thought patterns. So people tend to be at the mercy of themselves, at first. But the good news is it all comes good with practice.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Yo Frank! Bravo Post.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
<br>
That's one thing I can say for the Mysticweb people- the certainly do have a very ordered and controlled way of going about things.
<br>
<br>
I'll master real-time this time, and I can see how the thinking and ability to concentrate is vital. Testament to what Robert Bruce says on the matter.
<br>
<br>
Take care.

Thank you two for your responses. They should make my experiences smoother and more memorable.[

<br>
<br>
I assumed that mental clarity was the key to success from the beginning, and unfortunately, that takes time. I've have tasted my two OBEs and now I am hungry for more.[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>

<br>
I guess there is no way around it but to practice, practice, practice. But that's OK, as long as the end result is to my satisfaction.[^]
<br>
<br>
I will try the rollout or stand-up method the next time I accidently have an OBE (unless I master the skill by then; LOL) and will keep you up to date, sweet_celestial_sounds. I can't wait to hear if you were successful with the Hemisync CD you mentioned here.
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Frank, for also explaining to me what was going on during my reentry. I was starting to get worried about why I didn't just reenter my body like the first time: smoothly and then immediately waking up. Now I understand the situation a bit better.
