<section>
Just saw an interesting program, about this, and I could not believe it?
<br>
<br>
Basically, what people were describing, very exactly were OBEs!
<br>
<br>
A lot of discussion about very loud sounds,  sleep paralysis, vibrations!
<br>
And of course, complete blind mortal primal fear. (you have to experience it to grasp how scary it is.)
<br>
Interesting though, it tried to explain all these as 100% physicals chemical effects in the brain.  Well Sleep paralysis, as we know is chemical - perhaps the primal fear, is actually a chemical also, like it explains in the program.  I've never seen this explanation of "Fear" in context on OBE - i.e. it's chemical. Which is why this program was very interesting, just because they were heavily exploring what happens when you fall asleep!
<br>
<br>
It appears to me a lot of people describing  "Alien Abduction" is just really
<br>
a OBE/Astal type event, and since they have never had that experience before, or know anything about OBE, they link what they see to the closest thing in their imaginations - which is alien abduction type stories.
<br>
<br>
Very precisely, people are describing having a concious sudden OBE, and when out of OBE startled at seeing strange people, and thier imaginations (astral) take over.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone else think this way?

wow thanks that Robert Peterson stuff was exactly what I was looking for!!
<br>
<br>
For example, I've just read something on this forum, which many other people would class as an Alien Abduction Scenario!

 Hello everyone
 <br>
 <br>
 The other day I was in a hotel in Chicago and was pretty tired so I decided to lay down on the bed and do some energy work.  This was during daylight.  Now I haven't successfully projected before, but I have come very close.  I tend to pull myself out of it at the last second.  Anyways... after maybe 20 minutes of mediation/energy raising suddenly I could see through closed eyelids.  This has only happened to me once before and it was for only a few seconds.  From reading Astral Dynamics my best guess would be that I had Real Time Zone sight.  Everything was murky brown/white colored.  I seemed to be "seeing" from where my physical eyes would be.  Suddenly from the left side of my vision a white ghost/spirit something or rather came floating by(I couldn't adjust my vision, left, right, up, down or otherwise.... it was just stuck in one place).  I wasn't scared of it (which surprised me), and instead I focused on it and tried to say "Hello".  It stopped when it was right in front of me... just beyond the foot of the bed.  It was clothed in robes/rags, that sort of thing, and I couldn't see a face.  Nothing happened then so I was sort of baffled for a second... it just stared at me.    Then it flew at me real quick, and I woke up.  I noticed  an energy rush right when "collided" with me.   All in all I thought the whole thing was amazing.  The most vivid experience I have had to date.  I doubt this is really something out of the ordinary for a veteran projector... but it's new for me!!!  In my ponderings I have come up with a few theories.  First, I thought it was real time zone vision, and I saw a spirit.  Then I thought maybe I had projected, and the "spirit" was my projected double reentering my body(though I had no vision or memory of being that second spirit/body/thing).  The energy rush at the last second was maybe the energy symptoms associated with reentry?  I briefly pondered that maybe I had become possessed...lol, but I'm not worried.  I feel great, nothing out of the ordinary has happened since, and the spirit didn't seem hostile or anything of that sort.
 <br>
 <br>
 Well, got kind of long... but that's that.  It was a most amazing experience for me.  If anyone has any ideas of exactly what it was - I'd love to hear em!!  I am pretty much a rookie at OBE of any kind.  I know this doesn't compare to some of the wild stories I read on the forums... but it sure blew my mind for awhile!!!   Thanks much!
 <br>
 <br>
 Take care,
 <br>

BNG:
<br>
<br>
Yes, I too have thought the same way for a number of years after reading a number of people's accounts. I found myself sitting there shaking my head thinking, these people are having obe experiences and simply don't realise it!
<br>
<br>
One of the biggest surprises people typically have when entering non-physical realms for the first time is they meet other people. But I suppose if someone happened to "come awake" within, say, Focus 3 of consciousness and find themselves within some kind of strange-looking town where people were walking around wearing non-conventional clothing... what else are they to think? But that somehow they have been transported to another planet.
<br>
<br>
Of course, if that be the case then "aliens" must surely have been the "cause". And once you start entertaining that notion then all manner of events will begin coming into play, simply due to the nature of the environment. Before you know it there will be "alien spacecraft" landing all over the place, and you'll end up surrounded by little green men making meep-meep noises, lol.
<br>
<br>
At which point blind fear and total panic is going to set in, and again because of the nature of the environment you are then going to find yourself in situations where that blind fear and total panic is justified... and so it goes on.
<br>
<br>

That may account for some if not most of these accounts.
<br>
However there are others in which the craft has been photographed and/or registered on Radar. So i have another theory for these cases.
<br>
i actually don't buy the idea that they are aliens in the ET sense, but I do think its possible that they may be people from an alternative universe, perhaps a parallel one, of which there may be an insane amount. In some of these universes, people might have found a means of traveling between universes, perhaps using some kind of machine. This is what some of these ufos are. In which case isnt it natural that they might want to check out some of the inhabitants here?

<section>
Doug:
<br>
<br>
Correct.
<br>
<br>
What you are saying actually crossed my mind when I put up my previous post. I thought someone is bound to mention the more physical aspects of the phenomena, caught on radar, etc. This is what is known as interdimensional bleed-through. Which is basically what you are saying.
<br>
<br>
There are a huge number of other physical dimensions (possibly infinite number) and the most amazing thing is, they all occupy much the same physical space.
<br>
<br>
Between them, so to speak, is a Trans-Dimensional area of consciousness that acts as a kind of buffer between each physical world. So each one is separate but connected at the same time. It's all amazing stuff.

I've heard people talk about "astral aliens" which might be like the negs people talk about in the self-defense boards.
<br>

I once had a lucid dream with those symptoms and I was terrified that it was an alien abduction nightmare, so I made myself wake up.  Now I realize that it was probably a projection that never happened because I was so scared.

 Unlikely, since that would presume it serves a particular worthwhile purpose that should be listened to.

 I doubt there would be any OBEers left on these boards if they would have listened to these barriers.

<br>
I agree, but you could argue you were ready. Very Ready.
<br>
<br>
I'm talking about people who are not on the "path" and not on these forums, people who don't know much about it, happen to get into OBE type scenario, the fear then would be a very effective barrier to stop people doing OBE unless they had a pre-determined plan.
<br>
<br>
When I first experienced, I just panicked and stopped, and went back into body.  So it was enought to stop me, and I knew what I was doing and exactly what to expect. Although I knew what to expect, so it's easy to handle, and try and overcome. But for a person no on the "path" just messing about, it seems like a very effective barrier.
<br>
<br>
In some ways it's the first lesson we all have to learn to Project, to be mentally determined to over-come it, and that alone I think is a very effective barrier, to stop casual people getting into it.?

There are alot of people (myself included) who believe that the gods of the past were extra-terrestrials. And that they put us here. They built the pyramids, stonehenge, and many of the other mysterious ancient landmarks. There are cave drawings and hieroglyphics of ufos. There were gods that had "boats" that could fly to the stars. The Dogon people of africa knew about a star thousands of years before it was discovered by modern astronomers. They believed they were descendants from inhabitants of that star system. This is why fully developed civilizations such as Sumer just popped up out of nowhere.

I saw another program hosted by Roger Moore, about how Russians found a alien skeleton under a pyramid, and the pyramids are like a star chart, indicating where this alien was from - all very interesting, clearly the ancients do indeed have greater knowledge of the stars (and moving massive rocks) than we do now.

I don't know what it is about people in the way they suddenly jump to conclusions when coming to a thought about an action they consider would be impossible for an "ancient" civilisation.

So what, they built a few pyramids?

Maybe they were just bored. After all, there was no telly, no videos, no Internet. Lots of short winter days, standing around in the cold with nothing to do. What better than a long-term pyramid project to occupy people's minds and keep them warm in the winter?

Having had personal experiences, I couldn't agree more with this. (I mentioned this exact same thing on a different thread).
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, my experiences beyond this is pretty limited, so my question on this is: if the old hag, aliens, etc. are hallucinations (which I'm quite certain they are) isn't it fair to say that very likely so is the rest of OBE experiences? How do you discern what is more real/authentic than an alien or old hag?

Frank, I did not base that belief on the fact that I thought it would be impossible for whatever human technology that existed back then to create the pyramids. It is much more than that. For one it is more than just the ancient buildings and landmarks but one thing about the pyramids is that they have settled less than a 1/4 of an inch in their entire existence when most buildings today settle 6 inches in a year. But like I said there is more than just the pyramids for evidence.

Huh?

But the house I'm living in, like most houses in the village, dates from the 16th century. By your reckoning we should all be living over 200ft underground then? I think someone's got their sums wrong.

Also, correct me if I am wrong but granite is pretty hard stuff, is it not? Like, you if you were to build something on a humongous multi-zillion-ton slab of granite, wouldn't you kind of expect it not to sink?

lol, I dont mean 6 inches every year. They settle when they are recently built. The Pyramids settled only a 1/4 inch.

Never mind the pyraminds!!

We can't figure out how a feeble man, single handedly built
<br>
a castle out of gigantic stone blocks.
<br>
No-one ever saw how he moved the blocks, and worked at night, without any kind of machinery !!! Just him and the giant blocks of stone.
<br>
he claimed to have discovered the secrets of the pyramid builders.
<br>
If we can't figure out how a guy in the 40s did this, we have no hope to figure out how the pyramids were made, and so far, that's perfectly true, after all, he left a giant castle as proof.
<br>
<br>
The pyramids do clearly hold a hidden message perfectly kept thought the age of time, so perfect.

Is it really cold in winter time in Egypt? Anyways it it is not as easy as you think it is. People that believe aliens landed on earth in the past, do not just figure this because they see a big rock that was moved or something:
<br>
<br>
Just a few things:
<br>
- the distance from the pyramid to the north pole is exactly equal to the distance from the pyramid to the centre of the earth.
<br>
-pyramids are found also in south America and China, similar charakters as well as drawings that clearly show People from othe continents are found as well.
<br>
- ancient People talk alot about aliens that came from the sky, like the Indian vedes
<br>
Just read Erich v. Däniken and you all have hundreds of cases like that
<br>
<br>
There are many findings all over the world that do not fit into the picture we currently have about our past.

When trying to impress, people always focus on the BIG stuff about pyramids: Where they are, how big they are, etc.
<br>
<br>
The most impressive feat in building those pyramids was none of those. It was manufacturing the stone blocks they're made of. Thousands of chunks of rock, cut (with fairly primitive tools) so straight and with such perfect angles, you couldn't even stick a knife between two of them.
<br>
<br>
THAT is what's truly impressive. Any idiot can pile lots of rocks together in the right place, but it takes true skill to make bricks like that by hand.

<section>
The sensed presence as well as the irrational fear seem to be the result of anomalous temporal lobe activity. Amygdala, the fear center is just beneath the temporal lobe. Since pre-OB states are obviously characterized by seizures in the temporal lobe, associated anomalous limbic activation is very likely.
<br>
<br>
Eastern gurus say we should concentrate the nada sounds only on the right side. Also, you may remember to the not so old news that scientist found that stimulating the right angular gyrus causes OBE like symptoms. (It's well known that this kind of stimulation not increase the activity of local neurons but switch them off, thus separation is most likely result of some failure in the neuromatrix.) Perhaps triggering OBE is a function of the right temporal lobe.
<br>
<br>
Another observation: when I force separation I often feel a pull on the left side of my body, just below my solar plexus. I feel this spot too when I overflow my sub navel storage center in full waking consciousness. Since ascending nerves cross in the spinal tract or at the level of the thalamus, this spot is likely a projection of a brain structure from the opposite side.
<br>
<br>
At this point it doesn't seem rash to say that there should be a structure (or loosely localized functional unit) in the right hemisphere of the brain, presumably in the right temporal lobe, that failure trigger separation. It's a well known fact that the right amygdala, which is very close to this area, is responsible for the hallucination of fearful presences. You can test it if you like. Which is more pleasant, imagining a presence at your left or your right?
