<section>
I know that there was a discussion based around the 3rd eye and involuntary pressure in the head when seeking an OBE.  My questions are as follows:
<br>
<br>
1.  I have tried to rope technique, centered over my brow/3rd eye.  The more I focus on trying to climb the rope over my brow, the more intense the pressure in my brow Chakra becomes.  Is this progression, or a blockage?
<br>
<br>
2.  Is there any danger with the increasing pressure strictly on my brow?  Is this a sign that I should focus elsewhere, or a sign that I should concentrate my efforts even more?
<br>
<br>
I can push energy around my body, but the moment I try the rope technique centered around my brown the pressure instantly increases.
<br>
<br>
Any help is appreciated.

1) I've experienced pressure intense enough to reach through to the back of my head. Whether it is  progress or blockage depends on what other sensation/experiences you have at the time. Can you giive more details?
<br>
<br>
2) There seems to be the opinion that you can create an energy imbalance that may result in some psychosomatic type of trouble (hence the req. for details above) but at least in my case my body seems to have voided my energy work oon occasion (I'm guessing there have been imbalances and I've subconcsiously prevented furthering the problem)
<br>
<br>
If the ressure increases when you do an exit inducing technique I'd say go for it. Just listen to your body. You'll know when to ease off.

There is a technique involving the 3rd eye (ajna) chakra. It is to visualize a door through which you will intend to move. The body gradually becomes numb and the head seems to fill. A popping is heard / felt as the body is left through the door. It is not suggested as it tends to have more side effects than other techniques. Even so, it is commonly used to initially develop astral projection. That is why I sometimes try it.

Jilola/Tom,
<br>
<br>
My body was paralyzed, and I could feel a moderate pulsating vibration throughout.  At one point, I swore that I felt the feathers in my pillow as though they were going through my cheek.  They felt like pieces of straw.  I'm not sure if my astral body was loose, and went a couple of inches to the right of my physical body.  Also, I had this sensation that my head wanted to turn to the right and upward.  It didn't feel physical though.
<br>
Alot of pressure was in my head. Wasn't sure if I should proceed after hearing about possible "dangers".  Could someone please define was these dangers are?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>

I don't know about possible dangers, but I do very much recognise the sensation you describe. Next time you get the head pressure and vibrations, try concentrating on your chest area. What you want to try and do is open up an energy pathway to your chest centre.
<br>
<br>
When you do so, you will feel a rushing tingling sensation from the top of your head to your chest area. At which point it will feel like your whole chest cavity expanded. With me, when this happens, I get a feeling like I just fell downwards about 200 feet in a second or two. Which gives a *major* rush. Then I block the energy flow, rise up again, and repeat. It's immense fun. After 10 of these you come back to the Physical, all full of beans and giggling your head off.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank,
<br>
<br>
I believe that I am close to projecting.  However, I would like to state that I am very thankful for your advice, and accurate "sensory" descriptions.  They help me put into perspective my progress.  As I continue to explore new sensations, and development it has been very helpful knowing that someone can relate to exactly what I am describing.  Thank you once again.
