Hello,
<br>
I'd like to share with you my only little experience about vibration. Obviously the following is just a subjective experience and not a objective scientific proof. Due to my strong scientific backgroung I strongly believe in the Galileo Galilei's experimental method.
<br>
Anyway, something strange really happend to me:
<br>
15 years ago, I was 23 years old and I had just spent a year doing the militare service. I was taking a short nap in my bedroom. It was about 2:00 PM.  When suddenly I woke up. I was completly paralized and I was feeling a strong vibration in my head. It wasn't paintful, just very annoying, you know, like when the dentist uses a low speed drill. The frequency of the vibration went up and down. Also, I knew that my eyes was closed but at the same time I was able to see the celing of my bedroom and the sun through the window. The only strange thing I noted was that the bedroom looked quite brighter than the usual. I was very lucid and I knew where I was and what I was doing. After a while a started feeling a strong fear. This feeling grew quickly becoming a real panic. I never felt in my life a fear so strong. It was completly out of my control. So I started shaking my body with all my strenght until I really woke up, opened my eyes and sat on my bed. I was sweat but the fear was completly disappeared. That's all folks. Again, this experience doesn't prove anything, but after 15 years I still remember it very very clearly.
<br>
<br>
Ciao,
<br>

What you have described are the typical pre-exit symptoms that you get at the moment of separation. Becoming fearful is very normal. But if you allow the vibrations to build and increase in pitch you will find you can leave your physical body and travel to different locations.

Luca, I agree with Frank.  What you were experiencing is what many people here experience all the time.  The key is that if you want to have a full OBE, you must get over your fear.  Fear is one of the number one things that hold people back from having a truly wonderful experience.
<br>
<br>
If you can get over your fear and relax into the vibrations, you will find that your astral body will naturally disconnect a little from your physical body.  Then simply use an exit technique (roll out, sit up, etc) to leave the area and explore this other amazing reality.

Keep smiling,

Hi Luca, your account is IDENTICAL to what happened to me a couple of months ago - apart from the fact that I had read about it in books beforehand, so that while I was lucid, I wasn't afraid of what was happening.
