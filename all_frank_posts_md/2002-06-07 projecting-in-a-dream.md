<section>
I have a question.  How many people or how many peopl have heard of projecting in a dream?  Not from a dream or a lucid dream but rather you are dreaming that you are projecting.   Is this common?  Or did I actually project but was unable to fully control my actions?
<br>
<br>
I had a dream that in which I projected and was going to do something I would not do if was able to project.   Basically I was going to take over some one elses body in the dream.  I knew this was a dream and was unable to turn it lucid so it ended up more like watching a movie from the first person view.  There were a couple of points at which I think I may have been in control but I ended up kinda going with the flow anyhow.  For more info on the dream look here.

Yep, I found that projection started to come into my normal dreams in just the same way as other aspects of my life. In the sense that I would dream *about* projecting rather than actually doing so.

<section>
So were you dreaming of projecting before you started doing it or was it the other way around?

I started dreaming after I started projecting. As I say, it would just come into my dreams like any other life event.

most of my experiences begin with a dream, I wake up in the dream and then let out a "whoop!" and start flying or doing things. Sometimes, not often, I will do something similar to what you have described, I wake up in the dream, then drift back into a dream state, neither awake in the dream, lucid, nor still dreaming, but a collusion of both. I am not sure if that is what you have described though... ?? do you man an OOB but dreaming that you are OOB?

Close but it is a dream of an OOB, not a realy one I don't think.  It fit in with the dream and didn't feel any different from the dream.
