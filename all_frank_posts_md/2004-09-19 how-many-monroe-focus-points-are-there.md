<section>
I have been looking for some information regarding how many 'Focus' points are used by the Monroe institute to signpost the various states of expanded awareness they explore?
<br>
<br>
Do the Focus points start at Focus 1 for example, or do the they begin at some other number, and where do they end?
<br>
<br>
I am familiar with a few of the 'F' numbers already but would be most grateful if one of the more knowledgeable members here would be able to point me in the direction of or provide a list of each focus point with it's corresponding characteristic.
<br>
<br>
I have tried looking on the Internet but have only found reference to a few of the Focus point numbers but not a complete list, many thanks for all of the help that you can provide.
<br>
<br>
Cheers
<br>

Robert Monroe used numbered focus levels to make things easy. I suggest you to read his three books and if it is possible to attend Â some seminars in his Institute. Focus levels are:
<br>
Focus 10: The state where the body sleeps and the mind is awake.
<br>
Focus 12: The state of expanded awareness. You can ask questions and receive back answers (From yourself or Highter Self if you wish)
<br>
Focus 15: the state of NO Time. You can go back and front in time.
<br>
Focus 21: The bridge to other energy systems
<br>
Focus 22: The system where we dream, but also where are people under the influence of drugs &amp; alcohol.
<br>
Focus 23: The system where souls do not know they are dead after maybe a sudden death and they are lost.
<br>
Focus 24 - 26: The Belief Systems Territory with all religions and sociaty systems, races, etc. etc.
<br>
Focus 27: The system where the Souls are free from belif Systems.
<br>
After Focus 27 the Souls stop coming back to earth. They evolve beyond Humans and at Focus level 33-34 you will find all Higher Selves, which send down their parts for experiences.
<br>
You can order some tapes from his site to experience the sounds of each Focus level. They have tapes till Focus level 27. After you practise you won't need the tapes anymore, although I still use them on a daily basis.

Hi cpsychis,
<br>
Many thanks for your reply and for all of the information, seeing the points explained like that has helped a lot.
<br>
<br>
I have ordered two of Robert Monroe's books and have previously read 'Cosmic Journeys' by Rosalind McKnight, some of the focus points were mentioned briefly in one of the earlier chapters.
<br>
<br>
From what I read in 'Cosmic Journeys' Would I be correct in saying that what Robert Monroe was doing at the institute was 'Phasing' as opposed to the traditional idea of an OBE as a phenomena that usually occurs at night, whether induced or not?
<br>
<br>
I know that last paragraph probably doesn't make much sense, but I have only ever had night time and early morning projections into the RTZ, I'm very interested in trying Phasing and have already experimented, hence my request for the set of focus points so that I can gauge where I am and how I am progressing.
<br>
<br>
Many thanks again.
