<section>
After reading a lot about OBE, I decided to try it out.  At first I tried sitting in a chair and doing the various exercises to achieve a trans and working into getting out of the body.  Didnt work.  I tried a couple times while going to sleep, but I just fell asleep.  I expected that.  One early morning I awoke and tried to fall asleep right away.  The thought crossed my mind about trying an OBE attempt.
<br>
<br>
I tried for the first time to let me body go asleep.  It happened in just a second.  My body went kind of numb and tingly.  I thought about what I have read about this being a sign to try and get out.  So, I thought I would try.  I lifted my head and it came out.  I turned it and looked at my physical head.  It was all shadowy.  I was fully aware.  I thought "Im doing it, keep it up".  So, I tried to sit up, but my chest was stuck.  When I pushed myself to get unstuck, I went back to my body.  I then let my body relax again, which made it go all tingly.  It took only a couple seconds.  I quickly thought that this was way to easy and maybe this wasnt real.  However, there I was trying to go out of my body again.  My chest was stuck again however.  I remembered that your supposed to relax an area that is stuck.  I tried and with one big effort, I was out of my body.
<br>
<br>
I kind of floated up.  I could see, but everything looked like I was wearing sunglasses in a dark room.  I thought to myself that I should keep saying that Im having an OBE and that I realize it.  I also kept repeating that I will remember everything.  I wasnt really scared.  I felt an urgency to leave my house really fast though.  I was scared of seeing something in my house while having this experience and have it freaking me out when I was awake.  I didnt want to see any weird stuff while in my house.
<br>
<br>
So, I quickly left my room, and head towards the door as fast as I could.  All the while, I was repeating over and over that I knew what was going on and that I was going to remember it.  While heading towards the door, my head started going through the ceiling.  I didnt want that, so I forced myself to go down.  I went out the door and started running down the street.  I felt like I was running.  I didnt even think of flying or traveling fast.  I was just running and enjoying the fact that I was out and completely aware.  I still kept repeating that I knew what was happening and that I would remember.  I never stopped saying that.  I think it helped a lot.
<br>
<br>
As I ran down the road, I turned on the highway and ran down the middle of it.  I guess Im just used to driving a car or something.  I was running on my hands and feet.  I knew this wasnt natural and thought for a second that I may be dreaming.  I knew I was fully aware though and just went with it.  The whole time I didnt see any of my body.  It was taking forever to go anywhere and the taught crossed my mind to try and move faster.  I somehow thought of summoning a wind power to blow me to make me go faster.  I thought this was strange as it happened.  It worked for a couple seconds as I turned a intersection to go up another road.
<br>
<br>
All the sudden I felt sucked back into my body and I was awake.  My wife had rolled over and woke me up.  It kind of bummed me out because everything seemed to be going so well my first time.  While running outside, the roads were all wet from a recent rain.  When I got out of bed, I thought that if this was indeed real, when I looked out of the window, it should be all wet outside.  When I looked out the window, the streets were all wet.  I thought this was strange.  I actually had some sort of positive check.  Not sure how valid it is though.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, that was my first experience.  Twice since then, just a day later, I thought about trying another OBE.  I tried in the early morning like before.  Just a couple seconds after thinking about it, my body did the numb/tingly thing.  I stopped it both times for some reason.  I didnt feel like going through with it for some reason.  Im not sure why.
<br>
<br>
I do have a couple questions though.  Is it normal for it to be so easy for me to get into this state?  Im a very active person and my brain never stops thinking.  I do have a lot of will power and I just told myself Im going to have an OBE and it happened.  I actually believed I could do it before I tried.  Maybe this had something to do with it.  However, believing in something like this is completely not my style.  I thought I would give it a good shot though.  So, is it possible to accomplish this so soon, or am I having a lucid dream and creating all of this from all of the information I have read?
<br>
<br>
Also, I am sort of scared to be aware out of my body and see something scary in my house.  I dont want to be awake and remember seeing something  while having the OBE and having it freak me out.  That's why I want to go outside.  If I do see anything scary, at least I will have my house to back to for safety.  I dont want to taint my house with bad memories.  Is there anyway to get over this?  Should  I go explore my house next time and not go outside?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the time.  It was a long post.  Any comments welcome.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You appear to be doing very well. A few slight hiccups but nothing out of the ordinary for someone just starting out. The fear aspect is quite present, but that is normal and will subside with practice.
<br>
<br>
Pehaps try to take things a little more steady next time, rather than rushing here and there. Keep up the running commentary, that's always a good thing. But try walking next time. :)
<br>
<br>
The thing to be careful of is to watch what you are thinking when in that state. You are bginning to enter realms of reality where thought equals action. So you don't want to be getting fearful, else you will end up in the very circumstances that serve to justify the level of fear you are releasing. So if you release a little fear (very common) you can easily find yourself in a mildly fearful circumstance. Then you'll find your experience starts rapidly deteriorating, as you tend to get locked in a downward spiral of ever more fearful circumstances. Eventually you end up getting zapped back to your physical state.
<br>
<br>
The key state to all astral exploration is to remain emotionally neutral, but just release a mild feeling of curiosity. If you can hold that state you should make better progress.
<br>
<br>
So next time try keeping that mental state, keep the running commentary and move about much more slowly. Take slow definite steps. Also, you will tend to find it easier if you walk a little distance away from your physical body initially, as the physical body can tend to exert a kind of "pull". Almost like a kind of magnetic attraction.
<br>
<br>
So move smartly away from your physical, then, once you are outside your house, say, slow down a bit and do some definite exploring.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I really did take things a little fast.  I knew that my time may be limited and I was on a mission!  Next time, I will try and slow down.
<br>
<br>
So how do I know that this wasnt some crazy dream?  I know that I was fully aware.  I had control of all my thoughts.  No question about that in my mind.  However, I do have a very active imagination.  I have read many peoples stories and read tons of research on OBE's before I tried it.  Is it possible my mind created all of this while I was having a lucid dream and it wasnt really a true OBE?  I have read that if you question it, it probably wasnt a true OBE.  However, I do recall exactly what my state of mind was while I was having this experience and I felt fully aware of what was going on.  I guess I only question it because a couple little events in the experience were unnatural (running on hands and feet and summoning a wind power to blow me faster).  They just seemed way absurd.  Also, it struck me weird how fast (seconds) it was to obtain this state.  It felt natural though.
<br>
<br>
I have another question if I may ask.  Lets say I wanted to travel to some destination that I have never been inside of, but I know where it is.  Is it possible to travel there, go inside, and observe what is going on?  Is the best way to travel there just to think of the place or do you walk/run/fly there?
<br>
<br>
Also, would my wife sleeping right next to me have any effect on the ability to have an OBE?  The obvious is if she moved and interrupted it.  I didnt know if anything that is not in this physical world, related to her, would hurt the chances of an attempt.
<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch.

Im not really feeling that I do as of now.  I think I need to have some more OBE's or whatever is happening before I conclude anything of that matter.  I sure hope I do.  The only thing that is preventing me from trying more is lack of time and lack of quiet.
