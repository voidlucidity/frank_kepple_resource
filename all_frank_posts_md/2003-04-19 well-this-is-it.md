<section>
My last post for a while [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]. (ha, fooled some of you didn't i? you thought i meant something about a war right? [
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
])
<br>
<br>
i purposefully held off on replying to many threads as of late, just so that i could try to make squeek's and panabelle's heads explode as they wonder why i don't go for the 1000 post mark (this should be my 999th post). [8D]
<br>
<br>
but really, i had much fun on this board. you guys have helped me out over the past year or so, helped me find a better spiritual path that i had been on, and for that i will be eternally grateful. thank you everyone (those who are here today, and those who were here when i first came here) [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
].
<br>
<br>
unfortunately, i feel a deep need to look within myself and begin being alone again. you have provided me with many answers to questions i had, but now i must find answers to questions that you can't provide.
<br>
<br>
so goodbye everyone, and good luck on your own paths [|)]. hopefully we will all grow to be our best [^] [|)].
<br>
<br>
(i'll still check in and read what people have posted, but i'm going to hold off on replying[

when i read your title for the post i thought you were talking about something that i say when people ask me what's going on.  i usually say ' this is what's going on '.  it woulda been ironic as hell if you were talking about the same thing.

Is this a trend? First timeless, now you...I'll miss you so much! Find what you're looking for quickly and come back real soon, ok? Oops, shouldn't say that. Spirituality doesn't come if forced, I know that from personal experience. [|)] Good luck; we'll all miss your charming personality and wonderful advice.

Kakkarot,

<br>
As I'm rather new I didn't know you but your past posts that I've read are enlightening to say the least.
<br>
<br>
Good luck to you and I wish you the best!
