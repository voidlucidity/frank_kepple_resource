<section>
Hello everyone, my name is Ben and i just stumbled on this website yesterday while researching OBEs. I just recently (3-4 days ago) started researching OBE, mostly reading different forums. Mostly astralweb (Which i now view as more of a cult, jeez those guys are weird
<img alt=";D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/grin.png" title="Grin"/>
) and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///outofbody.co.uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 outofbody.co.uk
</a>
forums. I stumbled here and i have to say this place looks like the most liberal, "real-deal" type forum.
<br>
<br>
My interest in OBE was sparked recently by a friend and I started to do some research on the web, even going so far as to spend about 45 minutes yesterday trying to project (I'm not sure im ready yet, but i do believe i started to enter focus 10, i remember experiencing the beginning of dreams only to "bring myself back" so to speak, to continue my focus on my heartbeat. It was then that i started to feel totally unproportional, i.e., shrinking then growing, and also the "living inside my head" feeling. Could i perhaps have begun the phasing process or is it just wishful thinking from my first experiance?
<br>
<br>
Another thing i learned recently from my mother is that my dad(who passed away when i was 11, i am 18 now.) was a very spiritual person who attended some astral projection courses and also was very interested in chakras, etc. Again, this could be wishful thinking but perhaps I am one of the more spiritually inclined people? Maybe I just have an older soul!

<br>
<br>
Anyway, i hope to stick around and continue on my path, thanks for having me guys and good luck to all of you!
<br>
<br>
P.S. Frank you are really a fountain of knowledge and an inspiration to us all, I've learned more from reading 6 or 7 of your posts than i did from 9 years of Catholic School! Keep it up man, you're doing great work. And that goes for all the "teachers" here, you really do help us all and if it wasn't for you guys there would be alot of us clueless, so thanks guys

Hello Ben
<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great introduction.  Welcome to the Forums.
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are already making progress.  Keep it up, and we look forward to hearing of your experiences!

Great news about the lucid dream - the journal will really help with remembering dreams and having more lucid dreams.
