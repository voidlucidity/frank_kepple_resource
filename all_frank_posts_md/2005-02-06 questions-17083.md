1) No. There can be as much light in the room as you want.
<br>
<br>
2) No, you don't have to close your eyes. Most people just find it easier and less distracting.
<br>
<br>
3) You can project from any position, most people just find it a lot easier when they're comfortable and relaxed. Most people find sitting or lying down more confortable and relaxing.
<br>
<br>
4) It's bigger.

Hi there,
<br>
<br>
&gt; 1. does it have to be dark
<br>
<br>
No.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. do I have to close my eyes
<br>
<br>
When APing, your body normally is asleep. Eyes close automatically while/after the body falls/fell asleep. As for the induction, it's probably easier with eyes closed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. can I do it  sitting, lying, ect.
<br>
<br>
Yes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. is the astral world as big as the real world
<br>
<br>
Yes. And bigger. And smaller.

If the "real world" is supposed to be infinite...  Nothing is bigger than infinity, right?
