OK, ok- I know I am taking it a little overboard, posting all of these tests, but I find them so interesting.  This one is rather famous:Keirsey Temperament Sorter II:If only you could know a book by its cover or people by their faces! Whether you're searching for romance, a more fulfilling career, or deeper communication with the people in your life, understanding your own patterns and preferences is the first step.

All Idealists (NFs) share the following core characteristics:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Idealists are enthusiastic, they trust their intuition, yearn for romance, seek their true self, prize meaningful relationships, and dream of attaining wisdom.
<br>
Idealists  pride themselves on being loving, kindhearted, and authentic.
<br>
Idealists tend to be giving, trusting, spiritual, and they are focused on personal journeys and human potentials.
<br>
Idealists make intense mates, nurturing parents, and inspirational leaders.
<br>
<br>
Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self--always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.
<br>
<br>
Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.

I agree-- but in the end I do think they offer some insight.  I did once take a 600 question personality test and the results really weren't too much different than these shorter ones, so they can be accurate.  They do rely on the test takers honesty, so it's always advisable to answer them according to how you really are and not how you would like to be.

<section>
Yeah I agree. As a tool for getting a starting point they are good.
<br>
But they can be fooled as long as your short term memory is accurate. So honesty is important. SOmetimes they are frustrating though with the choices for a reply being totally incompatible for you. And yet one has to be chosen.

Part of it is because it deals with absolutes.  Life often gives you problems that require solututions, and often the viable solutions don't always agree with you.

My result was a Rational (NT). Having taken the test before, I know I am an INTJ. It did not seem to go into detail or give all 4 letters. It is good to see consistent results over the years.

My ex-husband would have a COW if he saw this.  Me, rational?  HA HA HA But it makes sense, I'm an ENTP/INTP (depending on the day), so it fits.  I never thought of myself as an Inventor . . . I'd much rather be the MASTERMIND, nyuk nyuk nyuk!!!!  I really am into "unlocking the secrets of the Universe" . . . maybe that's why I do what I do on the Astral!

All Rationals (NTs) share the following core characteristics:
<br>
<br>
Rationals tend to be pragmatic, skeptical, self-contained, and focused on problem-solving and systems analysis.  Rationals pride themselves on being ingenious, independent, and strong willed.  Rationals make reasonable mates, individualizing parents, and strategic leaders.  Rationals are even-tempered, they trust logic, yearn for achievement, seek knowledge, prize technology, and dream of understanding how the world works.
<br>
<br>
Rationals are the problem solving temperament, particularly if the problem has to do with the many complex systems that make up the world around us. Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better.
<br>
<br>
Rationals are very scarce, comprising as little as 5 to 7 percent of the population. But because of their drive to unlock the secrets of nature, and to develop new technologies, they have done much to shape our world.
<br>
<br>
The four types of Rationals are:  Architects (INTP) | Fieldmarshals (ENTJ) | Inventors (ENTP) | Masterminds (INTJ)
