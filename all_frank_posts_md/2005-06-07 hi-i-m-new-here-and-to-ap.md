hi. I've only done attempted astral projection twice since yesterday. the first time i accidentally fell asleep. i awoke, however, and my body was surging with vibrations, and i controlled them into the head to toe and back to head motion. i almost got my head and hands out of my body, but i decided against it, because i had to leave soon. the second time ever was the same day, in the afternoon, about 6. i could barely get my forearms and lower legs to vibrate, and kept losing concentration, partly due to the fact that i had ear plugs in, so my mind made its own sounds(ie: random music from DDR), but when i really focused, my arms and legs began tingling more and more, but i had to stop because my elbows began to hurt due to the fact that they'd been in active for about an hour or so, and one of my friends was coming over. can anyone give me advice? Am I trying to hard?
