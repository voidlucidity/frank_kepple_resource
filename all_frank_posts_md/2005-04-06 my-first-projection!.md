I have finally done it! 5 minutes ago I just had my first OOBE. I entered a trance and then became partially out of body so i rolled out of my body. I thened tryed to jump through my roof but I hit it and fell back on the ground. Then I remembered to use my mind to fly and I went right through the roof! I caught a quick glimpse of outside and then I snapped back to my body.
<br>
<br>
Just a little excited that I finally had my first OBE. Opening the chakras followed by Robert's ROPE method is what seemed to induce it.

i first became interested about 6 months ago, but I probably haven't been seriously practicing for that long.

I just had my second projection!
<br>
After entering the trance state I opened each chakra individually and took a lot of time until I could feel sensations in all of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///them.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 them.It
</a>
then felt like my spine jerked off the bed which was a bit intense. I then did a bit of ROPE and I popped out of my body.
<br>
<br>
I then tried to fly through my window which wouldn't work! So I floated through my roof into my sisters room. I remember seeing posters in her room. I then flew out her window and I was outside! I flew really high for a while over my neighborhood. I couldn't believe how real it felt and how concious I was. It was a bit wierd though because it was night time and there was snow on the ground and when I projected it was day and there hadnt been snow for weeks.
<br>
<br>
I then seen a bunch of kids on bikes ride by. I tried to get their attention but none of them noticed me except for one who gave me a cold stare. I then started flying again when everything turned black and I was back in my body, but still paralysed. I then snapped out of it and when I got up it was like I was all disorientated and my vision was really messed up. I stumbled to my bathroom to take out my contact lenses. I thought "I hope I'm not in this disorientated state forever". It was really freaky. I tried to fly to see if I was still projecting or something but I couldn't fly.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly I woke up in a sweat in my bed and I was fine, no disorientation or blurred vision. I'm not sure what happened after the fun part when I was all messed up, it must have been my dream mind taking over or something, all I know was the first part was amazing, but the second part was freaky.
<br>
<br>
Also, is it possible to get into the exact real time zone. Like the same thing I just did except without the snow and other inconsistencies.

Well, the snow could just be the impression of the snow that youve had all season up in the great white north. You see when there is snow on the ground and everyone sees it, it gains solidarity in the astral, for the same reason that you might see furniture in your room that isnt there. Just a guess but thats how I would explain it.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if its possible to modify the RTZ, i.e. think of it being daytime and it will be? Anyone?
<br>
<br>
Ps the blurred vision part was a False Awakening i think they are called, and yes they can be VERY confusing.
