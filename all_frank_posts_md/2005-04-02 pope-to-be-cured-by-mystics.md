 Papal Prophecy Update
 <br>
 During his 3/16/05 appearance on Coast, Father Andrew Wingate shared prophetic visions regarding Pope John Paul II. On that show, Wingate predicted the Pope will be cured of a serious illness.
 <br>
 <br>
 Despite the recent reports coming from the Vatican of the Pope's failing health, Wingate believes the Pope's death is not imminent. During the first hour of Friday's show, he said the Pope would be cured by a group of mystics who will travel to Rome and become important figures in the church. If the Pope does pass away, however, Wingate said he would "have to reevaluate many things."
</blockquote>
<br>
Maybe Fr. Wingate was doing an April Fool's joke?
<br>
<br>
The Pope died the next day!

Telos:
<br>
<br>
He did actually say, according to your quote, that if the Pope does pass away then he would have to re-evaluate many things. Presumably he is now engaged in doing that.
<br>
<br>
Like, the whole construct of religion is a complete load of claptrap, LOL.

<section>
err Was he joking? If he was, it was good timing.
<br>
<br>
Ah... nvm. Considering It was a 'father' Wingate I guess he probably wasn't joking huh. He was cured, in a way, though

It was just the Pope's time to go. God was calling him. Or was it the guy downstairs that was calling him? Anyway,

 somebody

was calling him.

Actually, I think the Pope in his decrepit state was a perfect physical representation of the catholic church. Now it will be interesting to see if the death of the church will follow suit.

<section>
Frank, I had the same thought lol.
<br>
<br>
At first I thought maybe he would consider that all his experiences were illusions created by the devil. But then I remembered that he actually was summoned by Pope John Paul II himself, soon after he asked for God to confirm that his experiences were genuine. The Pope told Wingate to "continue his work," or something.
<br>
<br>
Wingate has already been lead astray by other visions that turned out the be false. He asked Heaven why, and they replied that they were just testing his vigilance and that he has done well to keep the faith. So, are they testing his vigilance again?
<br>
<br>
Maybe it's time Wingate starts testing Heaven, instead.

He he, nice comments everyone.

I was chatting on the moderator's section yesterday about never having seen anyone famous in the Transition Area of consciousness. Perhaps we should should all give it a try. Maybe get the old Pope to the disco we are holding tomorrow night on Astral Pulse Island. Ha ha ha ha... could you imagine old Pope JP doing a bit of a boogy to some 70's disco hit.

Maybe he meant "cured" and not "cured." As in how someone would cure a ham rather than how someone is cured of an illness.

<section>
Aunt Clair, this thread is primarily about Fr. Andrew Wingate and his false prophecy.
<br>
<br>
I don't believe anyone's statements were meant to mock the Pope. John Paul II was known as a lover of song and music (he called it his "Polish sin"). He was very energetic and athletic in his youth as well - he might very well enjoy an API disco (although if I were to venture at a prophecy, he would prefer
<i>
 swing
</i>
)
<br>
<br>
Likewise, the Catholic tradition praises God as
<i>
 objective truth
</i>
, revealable through reason. John Paul II embraced science and said that its role can be to purify religion of error and superstition. Father Wingate, while not a contemptible man, was in error, and in a somewhat glaring and therefore amusing way. And that's okay, because he's human.
<br>
<br>
It's kind of funny. Isn't it? I think if someone prophesied that I wasn't going to die soon, and then I died the very next day, I might be laughing. You should too!

For the past months, the pope didn't look healthy at all, he couldn't walk and probably could not feed himself also. Just by looking at him on TV; it seemed so difficult to raise only one of his arm to the crowd. Leaving his body can only be the cure that he will hope for and I'm sure that he will probably like to boogie on API because it must be a long time that he didn't danced since his body was becoming more like a prison for him. Hope that things are better for him now. As for Wingate, maybe there are more important things than trying to predict everything!
<br>
<br>
Lets try to boogie and be happy everyone,
<br>

Take care,

Yeah redcatherine, it's hard to imagine the Pope at a Metallica concert going into the moshpit for some action! Me too I don't like moshpits; too many elbows in the face.... Better to boogie on tha dance floor even if its a little bit cheezy.....

Well, you're right. Disco does suck. And I also feel the same way as Telos on the subject of Wingate and the Pope.

I have nothing against the Pope (er, ex-Pope I guess), but I notice people in general tend to get bent out of shape when others make a mockery or death, or in particular, someone in particular's death. Death isn't really too serious to joke about is it? I hope I'm not the only one to think that. I mean, the Pope led a great (and lengthy) life. At any rate, I wouldn't mind at all if someone got a giggle or two out of me getting plowed down by a car at a nice ripe age.

I just don't like the way some people judge so hastily and by their own, limited discrimination, which seems somewhat arrogant to me. Especially when it comes to things like disco. I never liked it either but just to take the edge of off what I just said previously to this... I'm afraid that that's just going too far.

Death is the last great taboo I guess.
<br>
<br>
I've never taken myself all that seriously, so my eventual physical demise has always been something I could laugh about. Now and again people have thought me a bit weird for doing so. They generally accuse me of "tempting fate" and all that garbage. Like, one day I'm going to get some deadly disease and then I won't be laughing, blah, blah, blah. But hearing that kind of talk just makes me laugh even more.
<br>
<br>
Thirty seven and a half million children die every year on this planet through lack of the most basic necessities, and most people just shrug thinking well, that's life. Yet some old guy in a funny hat snuffs it and everyone is in mourning. Bit of a weird kind of topsy-turvy world we live in! But that's death for ya, lol.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not like they won't find another one. Surely can't be all that difficult to choose someone with an appropriate degree of dullness. It is the catholic church after all. :)

I am also a Catholic but  I really don't think that the way it was written was something degrading or offensive. The major problem his how the media is handling this dying process; just like a spectacle. Waiting for him to take his last breath and probably we gonna have some kind of stupid similar ''reality show'' toward ''who will be the next pope'' decision process. Ironically, one month ago, I saw a documentary on the making of the movie of this particular process: the election of the pope. The Church do not need this kind of mediatic representation at all; it is only re-enforcing the bureaucratic stereotypical images that was built throughout time. The Church should be a place were people go each week to remind themselves that love and compassion is the most important thing for you and to the others around you; is it the image represented and how it has been used? Not really.

I was thinking on the same lines this morning while listening to the radio about the Pope. I mean, really, people die when they are old and their bodies can no longer function properly. Nothing that can really be done to hold off that process. People should try to do something about those who shouldn't need to die yet.
