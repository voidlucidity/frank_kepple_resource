<section>
this is a question I have wondered about for some time now.does how we eat (and drink) effect anyones ability to project conciously?
<br>
I ask this because I am just getting over a chocolate addiction[
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
].I am still addicted to coke/pepsi,etc. (he he... "addicted to coke"...).Once a dream character dressed in blue told me that m&amp;m's are "anti-static"(vibrations).me(spiderman) and superman were eating some,and the blue character didn't want

Greetings,
<br>
<br>
You can safely assume that any addictive and/or mind altering substance, will adversely affect Astral projection. Robert Monroe among others make this very point in books.
<br>
<br>
To that end, my view is that tobbaco, recreational drugs generally, alcohol, coffee, tea, cola are all out. We should remember that it takes sometimes many weeks to fully detoxify the system, so for any serious projector that would mean complete abstinence from these things. Even if one were to project under the influence of these drugs, the consequences in the Astral could be quite dramatic to say the least!
<br>
<br>
I don't know about chocolate. I am partial to chocolate myself I must say, although I don't partake very often.
<br>
<br>
As for food - we have discussed that in the other thread, but my own view is that meat, especially red meat will lower the vibrations generally, and any heavy meal, and meat is heavy, will seriously affect projection attempts - the latter again according to Monroe.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

This kind of theory sounds just like someone who tried to tell me that marijuana kills the soul. Many recreational drugs, especially dissociatives like dex and pcp, only enhance your chance of projecting as they do the very thing your attempting without them - dissociate your body from mind. At very high levels of dissociation it is almost certain you will have an OBE on one of these drugs.
<br>
<br>
I dont know the half-life of PCP, but the half-life of dex is 4-8hours (assuming no saturation), which means in a maximum of 48-72 hours the drug will no longer be in sufficient quantity to continue affecting you. If you are enzyme deficient this can take much longer, and usually after very high doses of dissociatives the after effects can be felt up to a week maximum.
<br>
<br>
As for foods like chocolate and cola I simply cant see how it could harm your chances of projecting. More and more research shows that chocolate is actually good for you in mediocre doses and why would you abstain from a substance which is not only very nice but also good for you? I can understand how caffeine could effect you if taken anywhere 24hours (at the max) before attempting to project, but how could a coffee a week, or even two days ago, harm your chances of projecting?
<br>
<br>
As for tobacco... Well, perhaps this could have an effect but I fail to see how anything that doesn't affect the brain significantly could in any way an affect on your chances of APing...
<br>
<br>
Sounds kinda puritan to me.

Another thing I forgot to add is that I have been on anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication for about a year now.I know that it definately has a very negative effect on my ability to raise energy and generate the astral body.I havent't been able to achieve these things as easily as before[
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
!].another thing is that I drink cola every day (it has caffiene).I'll have to drop that for awhile to see if it helps things.
<br>
<br>
does anyone know of the effects that anti-depressants have on the astral body or astral planes of reality? I would imajine it to have quite an effect.I also know that it takes about a
<i>
 month
</i>
for the physical body to de-toxify after stopping taking it.
<br>
<br>
there has to be some level of truth (due to the source of the information-dreams don't lie)in the blue character saying that M&amp;M's are "anti-static".he could have been refering to a dampening effect on the activity of the chakra that relates to the color blue (brow?, or throat?).spiderman and superman are both red, and that could relate to the color that relates to the lowest chakra,eating and pleasure being very primal impulses.what do you think?
<br>
<br>
-and I'm not just talking about mediocre "doses",I mean A LOT of M&amp;M's every day[
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
].they are very addicting.I'm over that now though. (damn it! why do they have to be so
<i>
 tasty
</i>
.I want some right now...)
<br>
<br>
I would like to know more about medications in any form and their effect on astral projection if anyone has any experience.I can't seem to generate any at the moment!

Here's something I posted before:
<br>
<br>
I would take a look at pages 373 and 374 of Astral Dynamics. I think what Robert Bruce says makes a lot of sense: "The only cases I have come across where projectors have had seriously bad experiences with lower subplanes involved hallucinogenic drugs being used to precipitate out-of-body experiences. Drugs, while capable of causing out-of-body experiences, sidestep the required skills and abilities necessary for safe conscious-exit projections. This breaks many natural laws concerning projection while artificially overcoming many natural safeguards and barriers. Natural barriers are there to protect the novice from operating in dimensional areas they are not equipped to experience."
<br>
<br>
Having seen the results of drugs on my clients (as I work as a lawyer doing indigent criminal defense in the office of the public defender), I would strongly advise against their use.
<br>
<br>
Very best,
<br>

What people put into their own body is their business, IMO. But I can only wholeheartedly agree with the statement, "Natural barriers are there to protect the novice from operating in dimensional areas they are not equipped to experience."

This post is by way of clarification regarding my statement on drugs. While I agree
<i>
 to a certain point
</i>
that what people put in their own body is their own business, the difference is with
<i>
 certain drugs
</i>
. From my experience with clients over the last few decades, when people are using certain controlled substances such as pcp or methamphetamine, their behavior impacts others, sometimes violently.

I think that, a big factor, is your approach to the drug. The associations you build up with it, combined with how psychologically/psychicly opened drugs tend to make you, can lead to your mind succuming to the idea that it is hurting you, so your body creates this condition (though doubtless, long term exposure to drugs is damaging, just how much I am not sure...). Well....each to their own truth. Residual toxins can cause stress and weaken your energy body, so I wouldn't be surprised if they dampen your chances of going OBE.

There is no doubt drugs are bad to some people. They effect everyone differently and as such are unpredictable in nature.. for example if you're a "super-male" with XX (I think?) chromosomes they bring out the animalistic nature - primarily that of anger and agression.
<br>
<br>
However, if you use safe drugs (that you've tested personally) in a good environment and mindset, with good trip sitters, they are an incredibly empowering tool for the mind. I think many people dont give drugs the respect they deserve. Every trip of mine I plan carefully and make sure has a high chance of success. Because of this I have only had an incredibly positive response from drugs.
<br>
<br>
There are also some inherent problems with drugs... some people have enzyme deficiencys which mean they cant metabolize them correctly... It is often those who have never tried drugs before and on a New Years Eve buy some bad E off a street dealer, pop it and end up in psychosis for a week.
<br>
<br>
Meh. Just my two cents.

One of my friends limited all carbs for a period of time and began to have extremely vivid dreams. I didn't think she was for real, but I did the same while experimenting with my diet.
<br>
<br>
When I go too low on carbs my energy body becomes *extremely* sensitive and active, and I have trouble falling asleep. When I finally fall asleep, I too have very vivid dreams. I also had what I think were two very short obe's during a four day period.
<br>
<br>
Now that I've found a reasonably healthy (=low for me personally)level of whole grains the activity and sensitivity seem to still be there. I think detox and diet has a big effect on obe activity. Plus, if you have allergies, a detox/healthy diet will allow you to breath through you nose during attempts and you won't have stuff dripping down your throat.
<br>
<br>
Details, details...
