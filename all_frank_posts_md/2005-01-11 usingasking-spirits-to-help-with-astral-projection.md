<section>
I'm a new member here and first of all i'd like to say hello to all of the seasoned and not so seasoned astral projectionists. I recently rediscovered this site and hope to astral project very soon.
<br>
<br>
Ok, my question is this. Can spirits help you astral project? I ask this because I constantly have a feeling of being watched and on alot of occasions have been getting "slapped" I would say. The "slaps" feel like a sharp gust of wind suddenly striking me on the right jaw. Â Feels like wind, but sometimes rings my right ear a bit. Also, it's done in the house where no wind blows.
<br>
<br>
Based upon this, I have come to the conclusion that it is the work of a spirit that wants something or for me to do something. This isn't really weird to me so much as irritating. I mean getting hit with anything while you're doing something is a major stitch in my side

On the astral projection, i've tried the stare at something for about an hour or something technique. It almost made me fall asleep and my leg started "pulsing". I really just kinda stopped then. Now after proving that it accomplishes something, i'm back and ready to try it in full

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I see no reason why you shouldn't try and summon some help through non-physical sources. Such people are a constant source of help and inspiration to me and I can highly recommend it. Calling them "spirits" this day and age, I this is a bit overly traditional. They are just people, at the end of the day, who have adopted a different lifestyle.
<br>
<br>
Your technique where you say you stared at something for an hour and almost fell asleep. Rather than staring at the object, try looking into it rather than staring. There is a subtle difference that makes all the difference if you get what I mean. You know you are doing it right when you see the object change character. When it happens the first few times, it tends to snap you out of the state.
<br>
<br>
As an example, when I first started doing this I used to look at a picture of a woman's head and shoulders. One day I was firmly locked into the altered state it produces then I saw, as plain as day, the woman raised her eyebrows and then winked at me. Caused me such a shock my heart nearly stopped. :)
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, after a while I realised that what I was viewing was not the actual picture itself, but a kind of overlay that I had created by projecting my thoughts onto the original photograph. This I hadn't noticed so another aspect of myself decided to attract my attention in order to point out the changed situation.
<br>
<br>
Another thing you should notice when you are doing it right, is in your peripheral vision you should see a different scene, so it feels like you are no longer in the same room. It's normal for me to see coloured lights, for example, like they are shining through a light mist. Yellow is a popular colour that often comes about with me.
<br>
<br>
Last time I did this was about a week ago and to my right I could see a cascading waterfall that was sparkling with a golden yellow light, and to my left was just a jet-black sky that was punctuated by millions of shining stars. But I have seen all manner of things besides.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Ok, thanks for the reply and i'll definitely consider them as people from now on. About your technique, i'll try that as soon as I can, which will probably be when I finish with this dreams post. I tried the staring at technique again last night though and I awoke this morning with my first dream that I could remember in about a month
