Hi gang, anybody have this problem?  You log in, click on 'my area' under personal (at top of page), are prompted to log in a second time, and after logging in, you are
<i>
 still
</i>
prompted to log in.  In other words you just cant get into your personal area no matter how many times you log in.  FRUSTRATING!!!

Now you mention it, it happens to me also. Though I fear we are about to receive a severe moderating for posting way off topic.

Try going to tools / internet options / privacy
<br>
and put the security level on low or off when you come here
<br>
This forum is heavily cookied out so it needs to accept them all
<br>
<br>
If thats a pain in the butt
<br>
instead you can try this if you have one of the more recent versions of internet explorer
<br>
<br>
down in the bottom right corner there is a little thing that should look like an eye with a minus
<br>
(if your not accepting cookies that is)
<br>
if you double click it you can configure internet explorer to accept cookies from only the forum
<br>
so that way you dont have to set your security level on low and risk excrement on other websites

Ah, mystery solved. Thank you. Yes, I block anything and everything entering my machine aside from the raw data I wish to see.
