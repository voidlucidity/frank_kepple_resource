timeless  ---   Perhaps if you posted an account of one of your OBEs in some detail then someone here could provide valuable information.
<br>
What do mean by calling your OBEs tube-type projections?? Are you refering to the method of separation of astral/ethereal body from physical body? Or does tube-type mean that you see a tunnel, portal or gate after projecting?
<br>
Note that votex exits (from the physical body) are rare but have been reported on several occasions. Also dimension-tunnels or -portals are really quite common. (Tunnels are reported by NDEers and portals are described by OBEers.&gt;)

Timeless,

I pulled this from one of my other posts, does it match up any?

  It is possible that I have been experienceing this for years, since age 10, maybe younger. I would often lay down to sleep and after a few minutes the room would change a little and I would find myslef being pulled down a tunnel. In the tunnel there is often orbs, but I always had the notion they were planets. They range in color but mostly are dark, black, purple, blue, and various other shades. The tunnel effect would eventually disapate and I would find myself in a large, seemingly endless, black room. I would spent massive amounts of time just walking around, kinda exploring the dark, before having enough of it and some what forcing myself to fall asleep. I always found this black room to be very comforting, which is why I would spend some time there before sleep.

I always assumed tube type projections were just RB's way of describing "phasing".
<br>
<br>
when i read the accounts of phasing the same thing seems to happen.  Theres a tunnel etc..
<br>
<br>
Instead of tunnel though i figured he just used "tube".

  Dear GreyTraveller,
  <br>
  They are tunnels, like NDE, only seem smaller. The reason I decided to post is because there seems to be symbols on portal doors out of the tunnel but I do not know what very many of the symbols mean.  I am hoping others might know about this but not likely if they have not been in the tunnels.
  <br>
  Respectfully,
  <br>

Ah, so what you are saying is you perceive the tunnel at the onset of the obe, yes? If so then the tunnel could well be your perception of the Astral Gateway at Focus 21 (in Monroe-speak).
<br>
<br>
Focus-21 is the bridge between 3-dimensional Physical and 4-dimensional Astral. When you make that transition it is often perceived as moving through some kind of tunnel or tube. I can never really tell whether or not, at this stage, I am actually travelling along some kind of tunnel-structure or whether that's just how I'm perceiving the transition.
<br>
<br>
The Astral does have all kinds of tube and grid structures which you can have fun travelling down. But in my case I come across these

 after
</i>
I make the 3D to 4D transition.
<br>
<br>
The symbols probably pertain to you in some way. Perhaps you are being guided to them in order to jog your memory of something, or maybe they are serving the purpose of stimulating curiosity. My now regular guide, Harath, used to put up all kinds of odd things just to get my curiosity going. Or maybe they identify portals to various places you might be being encouraged to visit, particularly as you say they are perceived as being on a doorway.
<br>
<br>
Maybe you should try mentally pushing open the door whilst picturing the symbol to see where it leads.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

This is just brainstorming and obviously not something i'd know but some possibilities I thought of:
<br>
<br>
One thing I remember about tube type projections is RB said people who are able to have them often are able to visit higher planes. This is probably because of the clairvoyant factor, and the fact their energy must be high to be clairvoyant in the first place.  Im sure other things are at play here too.
<br>
<br>
Do you think you might visit a different type of plane when you have these types?  Or is it the same as when you fall gently?
<br>
<br>
It sounds like fun though.. maybe its testing you to see if you'll snap out of it from fear.  I would think being a new projector if something that fast and long happened I'd startle and wake up.  Maybe its because you dont have fear combined with the fact your third eye is so active?  Maybe its a test to make sure you're ready for higher level projections..

<br>
That sounds really amazing.
<br>
<br>
I was reading more of that "Freedom Of Choice" article someone put a link to.  Actually Adrian also put it in that astral chat thread..anyway I got to a part which reminded me of your situation.
<br>
<br>
He describes almost exactly what you described.. as well as the white light and a feeling of love after being lifted to this new dimension. He also mentions how a lot of what happens is hard to recall later.   I forget what he called it but he it definitely has to do with meeting the higher self.
<br>
<br>
If you haven't read that yet you might want to see if thats what you experienced.
<br>
<br>
Its about halfway down the article.. maybe more.  Im reading a little at a time cus its hard for me to sit still at the computer and read a long document like that.

<br>
I really enjoy reading about your astral experiences in your posts. BTW, I ordered that Freedom of Choice book and it arrived in no time. Just started it, but can state that from what I've covered so far, it's a very worthwhile book.
<br>
<br>
Take care,

Hi timeless
<br>
Just reading through your posts and was reminded of an author who I used to read who also has the tube type projections. His name is Stuart Wilde and writes about metaphysicle stuff.

<br>
His projections always seemed to be at the whim of his guides though.
<br>
Cheers
