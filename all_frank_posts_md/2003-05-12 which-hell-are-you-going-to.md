Purgatory
<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.
<br>
<br>
The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!
<br>
<br>
Here is how you matched up against all the levels:
<br>
Level | Score
<br>
Purgatory | Very High
<br>
Level 1 - Limbo | Moderate
<br>
Level 2 | Low
<br>

<br>
Level 4 | Low
<br>
Level 5 | Moderate
<br>
Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low
<br>
Level 7 | Moderate
<br>
Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate
<br>
Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low

I guess I'll be seeing you in level 8, Fenris &amp; Secretseeress[8D]
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Eigth Level of Hell - the Malebolge
 <br>
 <br>
 Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.
 <br>

<br>
<br>
Sounds like a lovely place[

I scored high for level 9 (Cocytus), But I guess I still have a bit of work to do developing my evil side untill I'm properly qualified.

Hell is a state of mind.
<br>
<br>
We make our hell.
<br>
<br>
See, I am not like the other Christians who believe in fire and brimstone.

Last time i did this test i got Level 1 This time, using almost exactly the same answers (if i changed any it would have been for my benifit), i got Level 6! I smell something funny here. I'm gonna take it again using the same answers. Here are my current results though:
<br>
<br>
Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.
