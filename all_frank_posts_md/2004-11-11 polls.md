I do not know on whose part the problem is but I cannot vote in any polls. How are polls suppose to work now?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Sorry for any difficulties you are experiencing, I set up a poll "Frank's test poll" at the top of this section and tried it. It works for me, so please give it a try yourself and see what happens.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I can't vote in your poll either, Frank, unless I am missing something. When I go into your poll I am getting what I get in other polls. I see the results but I do not see any where from me to actually vote.

That is the condition I get now I have voted in my test poll. First I got a "Yes" and "No" radio button, but once you vote then the buttons go away. When you go to the thread after voting, all you see are the voting results at the top.
<br>
<br>
EDIT: I just tried it again as I remembered there was an existing poll in the Christian forum. I went to it and sure enough the radio buttons came up. I placed my vote and now when I go to it, the results show automatically. It would appear the system thinks you have already made a vote in whatever poll happens to be created.
<br>
<br>
I'll make a post in the moderator section and see if anyone has any ideas of what it might be.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Yes, that is how it looks whenever I go into a poll. It comes up like I have already voted even though I have not.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help.

Reference the announcement at the top of this section:
<br>
<br>
It would appear this is a browser compatibility issue. I am computer literate but by no means an expert, so I have to basically go along with what the experts tell me. Incidentally, I use IE v6 and Polls work for me.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for any inconvenience, but it does appear this issue is out of Admin's control.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello
<br>
<br>
I can't vote either. Â Not that this bothers me, but I thought I'd mention it.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what version of Internet Explorer I use (I thought there was an easy way to find out, but my brain has frazzled on me), however my computer is only a few months old, so I guess it's the latest version.
<br>
<br>
Ho hum.
<br>

I don't think it is a bowser issue. At work I am using IE 6 and it would not work for me. I say would not, because this morning it now seems to be working, atleast for the one poll I found. So I assume someone found the problem and has fixed it. Thank you

<section>
Hi Frank, perhaps you should remove the sticky about the polls because it appears to be solved now?
