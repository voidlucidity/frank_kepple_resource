8:00am – 8:15am
<br>
I woke up around 7:30am, because the dogs were whining to go out. My girlfriend got up to take them out, so I decided I would stay awake in bed for a bit and then try to have a lucid dream.
<br>
<br>
After a while I put on "Super Sleep," put on my eye pillow, and laid on my back. I set my intention to have a lucid dream and used the wording "I need to have a lucid dream" to set a sense of urgency. I was focusing on noticing the blackness behind my eyelids while keeping my commenting mind in check. After a while I started seeing some faint hypnagogic imagery. I then started feeling pulsating waves of tingling/energy coming from my forehead down to my torso. I started playing with moving my arms, to see when the "switch" from physical to non-physical was going to take place. After a couple of time where I think I slightly moved my physical arms, the "Switch" took place and I was moving my non-physical (or an imaginary) set of arms. They tingled slightly when they moved, so that is how I knew they weren't physical. Everything was pitch black, so I sat up and then stood up. I looked down and couldn't see my legs or feet, but then I saw something where my left foot should have been. It looked like I had 8 toes or something. I was a little worried about being in the total darkness and once I caught myself worrying about it, I decided to go back to the physical – I didn't want my fears to manifest into anything. I tried moving my physical arms, but I was having problems due to my fake arms being so sensitive so I decided to force my leg to move and instantly I was back in C1.
<br>
I was glad for the experience, but my fears about the unknown were starting to manifest. I did, however, play with this MABA state and kept slipping back into it and would feel the pulsing tingle of energy starting at my forehead down to my torso. It was different than I imagined it would be (which is good, in my opinion) and felt more electric than I thought it would. I played with the outer to inner switch about 5 or 6 times, and then it looked like I came too far back to the physical, because I started getting antsy. I turned on my left side and tried going to sleep, but it didn't work so I got up and started writing.
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Notes and comments -
</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - I think this was phasing rather than having a traditional OBE/AP
</b>
<br>
The main reason why I say this is because I didn't have any of the exit sensations that I have read about. The only energy sensation was the pulsing described above, but that seemed to be independent of my "exit." Also, the feeling of my physical body being able to be moved whenever I want is also different than what I have read a traditional OBE to be. I didn't feel the need to have to move closer and merge back with my body to move it – all I needed to do was try to move my legs and it worked. However, I always envisioned phasing to F2oC to involve more visual and audio sensations, and I basically got none. Other than that, everything else appears consistent with how Frank and others have described phasing.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Some of Frank's comments that I have read make more sense
</b>
<br>
The "turning around 180 degrees" description that he has used is a good way to describe what happened. I felt like the physical was somewhere "back there" that I could get to at any time, but it wasn't at the forefront of my attention. I didn't actually feel anything "turning around," it was more like the outer took a backseat while the inner took the front seat.
<br>
<br>
Also, he has mentioned that the process takes on a life of its own, and I would agree that this experience this morning had a life of its own. I was just lying there and the MABA would kick in (along with the energy pulse). As I was playing with it and would come back to C1 I would basically just wait for the process to kick in again – and it would.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Moving my arms
</b>
<br>
The way I was moving the arms is slightly different tna moving physical arms, almost like thinking about moving them and doing so, but without the physical sensations. It seemed to me like moving my physical arms was a 2 step process, while moving these other arms were more of a 1 step process. I don't have enough experience yet to be more eloquent about describing this, but if anybody else knows what I am talking about and wants to jump in, go ahead. I say this 2 step business because I felt like I had to "hold back" when moving my fake arms so that I didn't accidentally move the real ones.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Fear
</b>
<br>
The fear of the unknown is very real. Sitting up in an alien environment (which this place was) and not being able to see or hear anything is a frightening experience. I am disappointed with myself for not venturing out further, but I want to get more familiar with these states before I do so. I don't want to push the limits and have an unchecked fear or worry manifest itself in F2oC and set me back or make me want to take a break. It is a conservative approach and the pioneers definitely had more guts than me, but I don't want to create an association of these states with fearful emotions. I remember Robert Monroe's forest analogy, and I want to be familiar and feel safe with the clearing before I venture further into the woods.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Morning + Setting Intent + Just noticing
</b>
<br>
I have not gotten up early enough to attempt to phase since my last experience. So I guess I am 2 for 2 in my latest attempts. I think the trick for me, as I stated in my previous post was getting up a little earlier than normal so that I am fully awake, then going to bed and setting an intent. Doing the noticing exercise while keeping the commenting mind in check also seems vital to the process. The intent is not simply just stating want – it is done via recalling the feeling of intent that I learned from Bruce Moen's "Silly Little Finger Bending Exercise" that I got from his latest book. I will summarize the exercise below for the benefit of anyone who isn't able to purchase the book.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 - Setting Intent Exercise
</b>
<br>
I am not copying the exercise from his book, I am just going on memory. I could be messing this exercise up from what Bruce Moen originally intended, but this is how I remembered doing it and is what appears to have been working for me.
<br>
The exercise has you trying to move the index finger on your non-dominant hand. This may take some time so don't try and get it right away. You want to slow down the process of moving the finger so that all the steps aren't blurred into 1 (like they normally are). Try intending to move the finger but, before you move it, you decide not to. Notice the feeling that you have when this is done and you don't actually move it. Then intend to move it and actually move it. Notice the feeling. For me, when I intended to move the finger but didn't, there was a definite feeling that was different than when I intended to move it and actually moved it. The feeling that I get when I actually move it is almost an "all systems are go" type of feeling and I pull the trigger and let the finger move. When I have been setting my intent in these morning phasing attempts, I imagine myself doing the finger bending exercise again and, when I have the "all systems are go" feeling and am moving my imaginary finger I recite my intent starting with "I need to..."
<br>
<br>
The "I need to ..." phrase also came about from Bruce Moen's book. He was talking about losing car keys and wandering about the house saying, "Where are my keys?" He said that changing the phrase from "Where are my keys?" to "I need my keys" forces a sense of urgency and you get subconscious help. I have tried this a few times in the physical with success, although the success isn't 100%. Anyways, combining the 2 exercises has proven helpful to me, so that's why I decided to post this.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
A great experience and thanks for sharing. I am pleased to note the reports from people who are trying my approach, and who are managing to duplicate my experiences.
<br>
<br>
From the sounds of it, you made the switch into Focus 1 of consciousness, not Focus 2. It doesn't matter, I'm not saying you blew it or anything, quite the contrary I'd say. One of the great aspects about the Phasing model is you can use it as a basic map that let's you know where you are within consciousness. But at first, you need to get some experience of recognising the kinds of actions that typically take place within each area.
<br>
<br>
The tingling kind of energy sensation you feel is the same as I have talked about before. Or at least something very similar. It's where I say that I often get a particular type of energy interaction between my head and my stomach area (purple and yellow energy centres). It feels almost like I'm charged-up with static electricity that crackles and tingles. If you concentrate on your head, it should intensify. Or at least, that is what happens to me. I think you are the first person to report that sensation as, when I've mentioned about it before, I never got any feedback. Problem is, sometimes you can't be sure whether a sensation is a personal one, or if it is universal. So now I know there is another person who can do it, the sensation could well be universal.
<br>
<br>
If you build the "pressure" of the energy by concentrating on it, at some point you will feel yourself "take off". When it happens with me, I just let myself go into the darkness and it's as if you travel here and there and eventually emerge somewhere. For a while, I might feel like I am moving upwards, then I might suddenly go to the left for a bit, then maybe down, and then up again. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the movement. All the while this movement is taking place I have no sight at all. Everything is just pitch black.
<br>
<br>
It would be interesting if the next time you felt this, to try what I am suggesting and see if the same effect comes about. Simply concentrate at the region in your head where you feel the "pressure" of the tingling and the buzzing and it should intensify. At some stage, as I say, you should take off into the darkness. It feels a bit scary, but you get used to it. As you take off, keep focused on the same point in your head to keep the energy buzzing else you'll "fall back" into the physical.
<br>
<br>
After about 15 seconds or so, of "travelling" here and there, I'll emerge into some place or other. I tend to come across a lot of the little flat suckerfish thingies that Monroe talks about in his first book. I'm not sure what they represent, but they must be some objective interpretation of an underlying energy flow within the physical. When I say "fish" they are not actually fish. But imagine the shape of a typical flatfish only thinner, about the thickness of a piece of card. They float and shimmer in what looks like a huge shoal of flatfish. When you walk through they stick to you. The temptation is to think ugh, and start trying to get them off you. But the more you try the more they'll stick to you. But if you just ignore them totally they will ignore you. So, as I say, they must be some kind of objective representation of your subjective energy.
<br>
<br>
The other place I see often is right "alongside" the suckerfish. I call it the Hall of a Thousand Spiders. Again, this must be some kind of objective representation of the underlying subjective energy. But it does look like a large open hall and all you can see are these huge spider's webs all over the place. On each web is a big spider and they are all scurrying about here and there. It's quite a sight. And there are loads of other "places" too that I have visited.
<br>
<br>
Often while in the "travelling" phase I have gone through all kinds of tunnels and other structures. At first it'll be pitch black and then I might find myself showered in a wondrous light that appears to be coming from some point ahead of me, or often "above". And it takes you like a kind of "tractor beam" effect and you emerge into some world or other. If you ever find yourself having these kinds of experiences you will realise where all the talk of angels and u.f.o. abductions stuff comes from.
<br>
<br>
So I just thought it would be interesting if you could try what I am suggesting and see if the same effects come about. The kinds of effects I am describing are not necessarily part of the Monroe F10 MABA state. The energy interaction is something else that is being superimposed on the F10/F12 experience, in that you don't necessarily have to feel the energy interaction. When I make "the switch" in a strict Phasing sense, there are no energy feelings at all. But I can initiate the energy feelings if I want to a large part of the time, and they come with some very interesting effects.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank:
<br>
Thanks for the reply. I actually don't ever remember reading a post by you about the energy sensations that I felt this morning, so that may be further evidence of it possibly being more than a personal phenomena.
<br>
<br>
When you say I was in F1, that must mean I was closer to the RTZ than the astral, correct?
<br>
<br>
The next time I have these energy sensations, I will try what you mention. I could see myself freaking out at the hall of spiders, but if I am feeling brave I will give it a try.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the post, it appears I am starting to make progress.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I've mentioned it now and again and it must have slipped your notice. Anyhow, from what you are saying the sensation is very similar. I've come across people having "vibrations" before but never this particular interaction from the head to the solar plexus region. With me it is a particular interaction between the purple and the yellow energy centres. If you are not aware of their location then do an Internet search on Chakras and you are bound to come across a diagram. The diagrams are largely correct, it's just all the bumf that people have attached to these energy centres over the years gets rather confusing.
<br>
<br>
If you project into the RTZ that would be F1 of the Phasing Model as I place the RTZ on the "edge" of the physical. Some people more mystically inclined call it a boundary region between physical and astral, or some even say it's the first astral "level" from the physical. Well, either way, we are talking about the same, or a very similar location in consciousness. My empirical analysis would place the RTZ within the physical. Plus, the notion of linear time is a physical-realm notion.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the Phasing Model, an RTZ projection would be the action of changing your perception within F1oC. As your perception changes, your experience changes, but all the while you are primarily focused within the same area in consciousness. When you do the action of creating a mental rundown, you create "the switch". The action of the switch is you shifting your area in consciousness from F1 to F2. You switch to F2 because that is where your imagination is held in consciousness, and you use the faculty of your imagination to create the rundown. But you can actually switch from F1 to F3 or even F4. But for beginners it is easier, IMO, to go from F1 to F2 first.
<br>
<br>
You mention about Bruce Moen, well, his approach is similar in some ways and very different in others. His model of consciousness is rather different, as it closely follows the Monroe, linear-focus model. His approach uses the imagination as a kind of primer exercise to make the switch directly to Focus 3. But his approach differs in the way the switch is made. What he is doing is creating a dual awareness of F1 and F3. F3 is the transition area, or the area in consciousness that incorporates the region that BM calls the Afterlife.
<br>
<br>
Creating an awareness of multiple focuses of attention at the same time is perfectly possible. I've said before that if someone really wants to confuse themselves silly, then offer an awareness of all 4 primary focuses of attention at once, lol. The experience of deja-vu is a dual awareness of F1 and F2, for example. We are what is known as a source/manifest reality system. The local source for our actions in consciousness within F1 is F2. So by offering yourself a dual awareness of F1 and F2 brings about the deja-vu effect.
<br>
<br>
All you need to do is: when you feel that crackling static-electricity feeling in your head, then concentrate on the point where you feel it is coming from in your head. Then you should feel it intensify, like the pressure gets turned up a bit. Keep turning it up and, at some point, you will "take off". Just allow this to happen. In a way it's like being on a roller coaster that runs absolutely silently in the pitch darkness. With me I keep switching direction here and there. Sometimes it chops and changes direction a lot, and other times not so much. Often you will feel yourself hurtling in one direction at an incredible speed and you'll get fearful of hitting something, lol.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, you will come to a stop. Don't try to force it to stop, just let the experience unfold as it wants. Don't be surprised also to come across all manner of tunnel or tube formations. Doing this you are still within the physical, it's just that the physical encompasses a far wider extent of actions than people suppose. At some point in your travel experience you'll make a switch. You don't have to, but chances are you will. At which point you will appear at some place. Where that may be is anyone's guess, which is all part of the fun!
<br>
<br>
Usually I "emerge" within F3 somewhere. But not always. Often I might hang around the physical. But when I say the physical I don't mean some kind of RTZ experience. As I say, there are many, many wondrous phenomena to be enjoyed within F1oC. If you have a copy of Astral Dynamics, on the back there is a graphical representation of what mystics typically call an Astral Plane Entrance Structure. These "structures" are a remarkable sight, totally awe inspiring, in fact.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

F1 is the physical, yes. You would still be in the physical while viewing such "entrance structures" though I use that term loosely as they are not actually entrance structures, as such. But it does seem that way at first glance.

I have experienced this interaction of the purple and yellow centers as well.  I have actually pulled the yellow out of my body and held it about a foot over me, and connected a cord from the purple to the yellow, after reading your post.  I am not sure it if it was visualisation strictly or what, but it worked very well.  I blacked out and found myself outside of a gas station by my parents house.  I was shocked by the vividness of it, and how well I remembered the experience.  Most of my obes are very short and in the RTZ via the traditional obe techniques, usually with overtones of f1 f2 overlays and distortions.  My experience with phasing shows that the distortions are gone and I can not tell the difference between the physical and the "astral", which messes with me on a daily basis, helping me to understand the fact that all levels are connected.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
They are not actually "levels" they are focuses of attention. I understand what you mean though. I think it's good that you are recognising these experiences for what they are. A few hundred years ago, depending upon where you lived you could have been burnt at the stake or worshiped as some kind of god. You appear to have a natural ability, and if you are getting repeated F1/F2 overlays then you have to be pretty careful on the fear aspect as you'll start seeing all manner of "devils and demons" else.
<br>

I already have for a long time frank!
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
Im workin on getting over that fear.  Its difficult to erase the fear, I am a special case.  I lived in a house that was built by hand by a man who killed himself in the house.  He still lives there.  I understand the difference between him and my personal "demons" now, but since i moved from that house I thought he had followed me or such other nonsense.  I am just realizing now that I have been creating them since the move.  My parents still live at the house and have regular poltergeist activity, usually any time they alter the house.  I was there the other day and heard what sounded like a bag with something heavy in it was being dragged around in my parents basement for about an hour.  When I would go to the basement door to see what it was it would stop.  After a while I got up enough courage to just charge downstairs and try to catch Harold by surprise, but nothing was there.  My parents cats had lodged themselves under a dresser, almost trapping themselves there to get away.  I feel so sorry for them!  They always stare off into dark rooms and their pupils will get huge and they will just tear off, hiding under anything they can.  I hope Harold finds his way to the light someday!

I had some more similar experiences this morning. After a while I remembered to try and make the energy more intense, but at that point I was a little uneasy about potential fear corrupting the experience... here is the journal entry.
<br>
<br>
7:45am – 8:30am
<br>
I woke up around 7am and laid in bed until my girlfriend got up at 7:30am. I put on Super Sleep and my eye pillow and tried to do the "just noticing." After a while I set my intent and a while after that I was seeing various shades of white. After a while my body went asleep and I must have dozed off for a bit. I was in a semi dream and I dreamed I half-remembered to try and phase so I started shadow-boxing in order to put the focus on my non-physical arms. After a bit it worked and I was fully lucid. At first I stopped and was noticed my breathing (non-physically) and everything was black (like last time). I moved around a bit and then I moved my body and came back to the physical. The next 2 times my body went asleep I sat up and turned to the left (I still couldn't see anything). I demanded "clarity now" and I tried to stand and was pulled back to my body. I tried again and was able to get up. I couldn't see that well but I could perceived a room and I was in a half dream. I saw some people so I went up to one and started twirling him around, hoping my sense of sight would kick in more and I would be able to "see" everything instead of just "perceive" things. I then remembered to check my fear and make sure I wasn't scared, and at that point the guy's eyes became red. I continued and laughed it off but felt for my body to be on the safe side. When I came back this time I noticed the pulsing tingle of energy from my forehead to my stomach, and I tried to intensify it and I noticed it would pulse to my stomach and back up. I knew I had to get up soon, and I was trying to not be afraid, but I felt like my fear would take over if I went out again and I didn't want to have to face mind-made demons so I aborted, turned on my side and relaxed until my girlfriend came to wake me up.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I can see from several of your posts that the fear aspect is a bit of a tricky thing with you. I think you are handling it very well in being careful not to scare yourself, but sometimes it might be good to push the boat out, so to speak. Sort of be a little bit more daring. In small doses of course. It's interesting you felt the tingling again. So it wasn't just a one off.
<br>
<br>
With me I get the head to solar plexus interaction direct from the physical. I need to be in a particular state of relaxation, which comes about after I've slept for a while and I'm in that slightly dreamy but largely awake state.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
