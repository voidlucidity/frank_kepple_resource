I read an article about a man who travelled to the futured and saw some lottery numbers. Then he came back and won the daily lottery.
<br>
<br>
Here's the article

What do you guys think about time travels? Are they possible?

Thing is, within the Astral there is no "time". Time is a 3-dimensional construct. I suppose the only thing missing from the post in question is a copy of the winning cheque. Without that, the claim is meaningless.

Whether time exists as we think of it (linearly) or not - I have had at least one very convincing precognitive dream - Happened the night before the actual events. So I tend to think that, however time exists, we can perceive it linearly,  instinctively.
<br>
<br>
That being said, I was intrigued by the claim on this article. I had a projection on Tuesday Morning of last week. Decided to try the approach that the gal talked about.
<br>
<br>
I found myself out, (actually, I recall the exit - I pulled out from my head which is unusual). I floated around my bedroom, and demanded to know the day's lottery numbers.
<br>
<br>
I saw the number "96" coming towards me. I scrutinized it, and deceded that it was actually "86."
<br>
<br>
I demanded to know the next number. Nothing. I said "Clearer!" For the first time ever, that command seemed to work for me. The 'nothing' snapped into the number "0."
<br>
<br>
Then I demanded to know the third number. Nothing. I was losing control at this point. So I re-entered, saitisfied that I had some data to work with.
<br>
<br>
I bought my first lotto ticket ever. The daily three. "86" isn't a legitimate number, so I picked "8" and "6" and "0" as my numbers.
<br>
<br>
These numbers ended up being wrong. The draw that day was 7-8-7.
<br>
<br>
For what it's worth.
