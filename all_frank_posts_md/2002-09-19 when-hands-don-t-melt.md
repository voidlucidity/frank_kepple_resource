I've read and experienced the so-called melting hands phenomenon. But I'm sure I have read somewhere that, under some circumstances, they don't.
<br>
<br>
It's just that this morning, I was on my 3rd projection and I think my physical body wanted me back for some reason (maybe it was missing me
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
). I felt my clarity fading and the idea of glancing at your hands for a moment, that I'd read in AD, suddenly popped into mind. So I looked at my hands, and looked, and looked, but nothing melted. Ideas anyone?

Not sure whether this is related - but I'll chuck it in anyway.
<br>
<br>
I've experienced several lucid dreams where I have tried "reality tests" e.g. switching on a light switch twice, trying to float, or trying to pass through solid objects.
<br>
<br>
On each occasion, the test results suggest I'm not actually in a lucid dream. However shortly after, something will inevitably happen that proves I'm lucid.
<br>
<br>
Point is, I don't think techniques such as looking at the hands are infallible....they probably have a high success rate because positive suggestion / reinforcement has already given the individual the idea that they will succeed (if that makes any sense !)

I have had experiences with both, Frank.  There have been times when they have melted, and other times when they didn't.  I never really considered a reason why.  I just lumped it in the same category of "Why was my furtniture slightly out of place last time I projected and this time it looked fine?"
<br>
<br>
What are your thoughts on this?  Do you think that sometimes we are more grounded in an "astral body" which appears more stable?  Maybe when we have a strong pull with the physical body, it's tougher to make them dissolve.....whereas in higher realms, where sometimes an astral body is completely discarded, this melting phase is easier to observe.
<br>
<br>
Just tossing out theories!

Forgive my confusion, but when you talk about "projections" these days, are you referring to your original OBE method (which you mentioned had been "overwritten" by the focus method), or indeed the focus method?
<br>
<br>
I think the "melting hands" phenomena relates to etheric (RTZ) projections, not Astral projections.
<br>

Wouldn't the simple thought of doing a reality check and knowing that you are thinking about doing one be enough to create the lucidity or awareness?  Simply put, active thought = consious awareness.
<br>
<br>
It has struck me that the need for a reality check is largly un-needed if you are "thinking" of doing one.  The thought itself would be the reality check.  The line of thinking would suggest that the effect of said desired reality check would vary on the amount of control.  Granted the effect of the hands actually melting would be helped by the pre-programmed idea that they "should".  The actual hand check may help you better grasp the situation but I feel it is largely un-needed.
<br>
<br>
I think a better guage of control or lucidity would be to try some thing you haven't done yet.  The melting hands is really just a confirmation anyhow.  I think a better test would be to think of having six fingers on one hand and then counting them.  An original thought would be better because there would be no this "should" happen and you then waste time when it doesn't.  Instead there should be the thought that this "will" happen and after picking up the hamburger at you feet taking a bite a screaming that it tastes like chicken you can continue on your marry way.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Or do I have a slightly abnormal thought process?

So what if the hands don't melt when you look at them. You don't want them to. What happens is that if you are consciously creating an image of hands then it will be difficult to sustain the image. If you expect to see your hands and your subconscious sustains the image of hands they will not melt. If you really, really want to watch something melt then create it through conscious effort and relax your efforts. It is better to have stability.

Greetings Focus15!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your excellent contribution

<br>
I definitely agree that we should not get stuck on the descriptions of Astral projection, OBE, focus, awareness etc.. - it is the individual experience and the knowledge and progress gained that is really important.
<br>
<br>
But - this new sub-forum is with view to defining and separating the types of Astral experience.  To me, at least, projection and focus are different but equal methods of Astral experience, and which might suit different people and different aspirations of the individual.
<br>
<br>
It might well be for example that people could never "project" in the accepted sense of the word, but can "meditate" to an Astral level of awareness (or higher, possibly much higher) and bring back the same experiences.
<br>
<br>
It is a highly personal and individual choice, but I do think it is sufficiently important to separate them. Another reason is to provide alternative possibilities for those that simply cannot project in the AD way.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I was wondering about melting hands also. When i am obe i have only remembered to look at my hands a couple of times- I cannot remember one but the other was that my fingers were big round things with rainbow light around them. I was thinking what Adrian said was true, that the only melt in the realtime zone, but have not found anything to back that up.

A type of candy is coming to mind (M&amp;M's). They claim that they melt in the mouth but not in the hands. The idea of melting hands combined with the idea of melting candy seemed amusing to me. Astral M&amp;M's.

That is what Robert implies in his literature.
<br>
<br>
The "real time zone" is still an etheric
<b>
 reflection
</b>
of the physical world and not the actual physical world, but as it is still an extension of the Astral it is still affected by mind.
<br>
<br>
I can only put forward a theory on this - but here it is:
<br>
<br>
Because etheric matter is affected by thought, your hands will only melt if you think that is what they should do. If you observe your etheric hands without without any thought, they probably won't melt.  Regarding the Astral - my speculation is that there are too many other things to be involved with rather than standing around thinking about hands melting.
<br>
<br>
You could probably proce this from an etheric projection by thinking about your feet melting instead, and watching them do so.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Adrian.

HI Frank,
<br>
This morning I had four OBE's and in one, I was mentally "pulling myself together" as I walked down the hall, through the living room and into the kitchen.  Once I was standing there and deciding what to do, I looked at my hands ... NO MELTAGE ... they appeared as real as waking life and as solid to touch, too.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
