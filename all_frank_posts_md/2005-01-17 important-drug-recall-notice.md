Hi All,
<br>
Just got this in an email .....
<br>
<br>
All drugs containing PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE are being recalled.
<br>
You may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and
<br>
inquire about a REFUND. Please read this CAREFULLY. Also, please pass
<br>
this on to everyone you know.
<br>
STOP TAKING anything containing this ingredient.
<br>
<br>
It has been linked to increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the
<br>
brain)  among women ages 18-49 in the three days after starting use of medication.
<br>
<br>
Problems were not found in men; however, the FDA recommended that everyone
<br>
(even children) seek an alternative medicine.
<br>
The following medications contain Phenylpropanolamine:
<br>
<br>

   <br>
    Triaminic Syrup Cold &amp; Allergy
    <br>
    Triaminic Triaminicol Cold &amp; Cough
    <br>
    <br>
    I just found out and called the 800# on the container for Triaminic
    <br>
    and they informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following
    <br>
    medicines because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and
    <br>
    seizures in children:
    <br>
    Orange 3D Cold &amp;Allergy Cherry (Pink)
    <br>
    3D Cold &amp;Cough Berry
    <br>
    3D Cough Relief Yellow 3D Expectorant
    <br>
    They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number
    <br>
    on the box so they can send you postage for you to send it back  to
    <br>
    them, and they will also issue you a refund.
    <br>
    If you know of anyone else with small children,
    <br>
    <br>
    PLEASE PASS THIS ON. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF!
    <br>
    DO PASS THIS ALONG TO ALL ON YOUR MAILING LIST
    <br>
    so people are informed.
    <br>
    They can then pass it along to their families.
    <br>
    To confirm these findings please take time to check the following

Er, call me think but what's an urban legend? I am thinking along the lines of it being a hoax, correct?

Thanks for clarifying this for me guys, I appreciate it immensely.
<br>
<br>
Since it's been around from 2000, that means we here in the nether regions of the planet are still in the dark over a lot of things, LOL

After seeing this thread I asked a pharmacist if it is still possible to buy phenylpropanolamine (PPA) and was told that it is not. I was also told that pseudephedrine will soon not be the only decongestant available because a new alternative would be both safer and less easily converted to controlled substances.
