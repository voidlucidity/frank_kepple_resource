If you've actually had an ObE, care to divulge your experience?  I just wanna know how cool it can be, or how scary, or how enlightening, etc.  You do not need to include the getting to the OBE state here.

Hi Squeek,
<br>
<br>
OBE's are a lot of fun for me! I generally don't have scary experiences and I've never encountered a neg.
<br>
<br>
Most commonly, I float out of my body and fly around the house. I sometimes have distortions, especially after passing through solid matter. Lately, I seem to have had the most trouble with windows, as I alsways seem to end up in an alternate version of my yard.
<br>
<br>
I've been to the astral proper a few times, and it hasn't been as fun as the RT Zone. I tend to feel more challenged there, as it is just
<b>
 so
</b>
complex and surreal. It still can be a lot of fun, though.
<br>
<br>
The morning/rest of the day after having an OBE, I tend to feel happier than usual, unless everything goes wrong and kills my happiness to begin with. Usually I feel like bouncing off the walls, more so as the day goes on. This effect seems to be less intense after trips to the astral proper, as opposed to the real time zone. However, I still have those feelings.
<br>
<br>
My favourite part is the flying. I always wanted to fly as a kid, and now I can.

Here's one I had awhile back:
<br>
<br>
13 March 2003
<br>
<br>
What's interesting about today's OBE is that it was sandwiched between two nightmares, yet my experience was a good one. One would think that, given the thought-come-reality nature of the astral, the nightmares would have manifested somehow in my OBE. But, they didn't, thank goodness!
<br>
<br>
It was about 1 in the morning. After my first nightmare took place, I found myself in my room. I got up and walked into the hallway. At that point, I started moving really slow, like a cross between being extremely tired and walking through molasses. At that point, I didn't know if I was OBE'ing or in the physical plane, so I decided to test it out. I tried to fall backwards on my butt, but I slowly floated onto my back instead. At that point I realised I was having an OBE. I floated through the living room and into the dining room, where I got really close to the closet door. I looked over to the computer room and saw Dad on the computer. I immediately realised that it was not true, that it was just a distortion, and turned back around. I thought to myself "I'm starting to learn to tell the distortions from reality."
<br>
<br>
I then began to pick up speed and flew back into my room. I tried to float through the window to go outside, but I found myself in my room again! *Note: The window had the blinds closed, so it was not like I saw a reflection of the room.*
<br>
<br>
At this point, I felt myself getting confused, so I decided to raise my energy as far as I can to try and get into the astral plane. Unfortunately, this never panned out, so I went into the dream state again.
<br>
<br>
After a brief dream, I woke up into the physical plane. I thought about what had happened, and was scared thinking about the nightmare. I was actually happy to have the OBE, because it relieved my tension stemming from the nightmare a bit. I was still scared to go back to sleep after I got up and did a few things, but eventually I did.
<br>
<br>
I then went back to sleep. I woke up in the morning after having a second nightmare.

here's one I had a few months ago and my thoughts during the astral travel:
<br>
<br>
I found myself aware that I was swimming in really deep waters. Oh I'm in the ocean. I have a school of fish swimming along side of me. I'm swimming like a fish. I look at my arms just moving like I belong in this water. I thought this amazing and wondered how could I breathe under water. I didn't realize in astral traveling that this could be done. I saw some scuba divers working in the area and when they took notice of me I looked around like "Oh just looking". In astral traveling you can hear their thoughts. Ok guess it's time to leave, that was enough for me, then I came back in my body.
<br>
<br>
I only recently started to note my feelings when exiting and entering my body. When leaving I feel "light and heightened awareness" but still conscious of my physical body,  and when I reenter I just open my eyes and feel awake. I keep a pen and paper by my bed so that as soon as I am back I can write or jot down my travel.
<br>
<br>
So have fun,
<br>
<br>

It was scary, cool, then enlightening, in that order.
<br>
<br>
The intense vibratory state was awesome, like being on a huge massage table that seemed to add to my already deep state of relaxation.  This caused my first sense of levitation off the bed and freaked me right out.
<br>
<br>
But then I started reading about OOBE and then I was at least mentally prepared for the 2nd occurance.  That little knowledge kept me calm and I was merely an observer of the whole process as I found myself with my face against the ceiling of my room.
<br>
<br>
During the 3rd occurance, I learned that being merely an observer can get you into trouble.  It's best to be a Participant and direct your own show than to let someone/something interfere with your experience in a negative way.  So I'm back to reading again and learning from the Generous Souls who have "been there/done that" and opted to share their experiences with us despite the fact that half the world probably thinks they're nuts or high or both.

   WOw..I didn't expect all that in a day  :p
   <br>
   <br>
   Very interesting experiences.  I would love to fly, or breathe underwater!  That would be truly amazing.  If anybody else cares to share, go ahead.

That's a good question. I have been fortunate to have had several projections. If interested you can read them at the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.astralsociety.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

website. Just go to the Journals sections and go down alphabetically to Greytraveller's Journal. OBE number 28 is of particular interest.

Truly amazing indeed but these activities are very much easier to say than to endure at the time. It takes a while for your protective sense of awareness to settle down and accept the idea of flight, or underwater exploration. I had particular difficulty overcoming the latter because I suspect having already had quite a bit of Physical scuba-diving experience my mindset was fixed one way.
<br>
<br>
Flying is a bit of an art which takes time also. The flight controls are all mental so there are no levers to pull or buttons to push. Learning how to land with the requisite degree of precision is tricky. Come in too steep and too fast and you'll either end up "underground" or your protective sense of awareness zaps you out of it. Come in too shallow and too fast and you end up crashing through all kinds of structures and/or your protective sense of awareness will again zap you out of it.
<br>
<br>
But like with many things it's just a question of practice. For me, up until a while ago, there was nothing that matched the sensation of entering the Astral through some kind of entrance structure (such as the one shown on the back cover of Astral Dynamics, for example).
<br>
