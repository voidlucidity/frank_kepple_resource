Woah!
<br>
<br>
Gonna introduce myself a little bit (LOT) before I start posting and have people wonder "Okay... but who the hell is that guy?!"
<br>
<br>
Basically, I'm a 16 year old MAN currently living in Marilia, SP - Brazil! Born here in Brazil, English good not so.
<br>
<br>
I change countries every year, and will be moving to ITALY later this month (to spend 6 months, then to England). This is to say that I won't be here long, since I've sold the PC.
<br>
<br>
I sold even all the silver wear and bedsheets, but that's beyond the point.
<br>
<br>
Moving so much made me highly frustrated, slightly depressed, and completely INSANE. First impressions are the ones that stick.

<br>
<br>
I'm somewhat of a medium, entire sides of family into spiritualism, and I see some really strange shizzle. Also a natural lucid dreamer (all life, most nights), and been having natural OBEs all my life (if I try to induce, I'm greeted by not so friendly astral entities which want nothing more than rip out my head).
<br>
<br>
I used to suffer from SLEEP PARALYSIS every night (also astral abductions, attacks), but that's before I totally LOST it and punched out a window, now they live me alone (they know better).
<br>
<br>
Alright, coo'. I'll shut up now, you guys know way too much and I don't want to ruin my fun. Peace! B

<section>
At least you have your families support through all of those spiritual attacks.
<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy Italy and welcome to the forums.

Not anymore.
<br>
<br>
Reason I'm not really posting or working on the experience log (although I will) is because my entire family is in Italy going through some rough times, and I'm alone here in Brazil going through some rough times myself.
