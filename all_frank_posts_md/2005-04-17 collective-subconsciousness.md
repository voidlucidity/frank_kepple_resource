I took some magic mushrooms with some friends once, and i came to the conclusion that we all had a collective subconscious, that is to say, that we were all thinking the same thing, but only subconsciously, this was a few months ago, one of my friends, who also took mushrooms that night didn't believe me either, until tonight, when he took some at his cousin's and had the same experience with him! I also know of many people who have had the same experience in the past, is it because of the drugs? or are we all connected in some subconscious way?

Haha, Major Tom. Well said.
<br>
<br>
However, when you look at the effects drugs have i think it ties in really closesly with the phasing model. And yeah, in some cases it can in effect, tear down some of the veils we have created for ourselves.
<br>
<br>
To answer your question, yes, we are all related on a different level of awareness.

This is why we can observe this cross-cultural practice in relation with shamanism. But we know that it is not the best approach to use if we want to go in trance or astral project because of the possible side effects. Â It is not surprising that many shamans will observe evil leprechauns (or other things....) when trying to cure someone ''in the other side''!
<br>
<br>
Take care,

I don't think we are all 'connected' by our subconsciousness.
<br>
I do believe however it is possible to encounter one another on another plane (for instance in the astral). This does not imply that we have some part of our mind in common, just that we walk the same reality (be it on the first or second plane).

Techinically speaking, we are all part of a big consciousness network in F4oC. So Gekko you are part right.

I have heard that it is possible to have transpersonal (i think thats what i t was called) experiences when doing drugs, and the same thing can happen when using hypnosis to look find past lives. I definitely agree with majortom though about the leprechauns.

Ben:
<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's right. In a way, we are all very much individuals but we're plugged into the same "network". Just like my computer is connected to the Internet and can communicate to other computers on the network, but I do not lose the individuality of my machine. Our minds are surprisingly similar. The main connections, so to speak, are held within Focus 4 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I've never taken any drugs apart from the odd prescription medicine and a moderate amount of alcohol. I certainly wouldn't recommend people take drugs in order to have experiences. Fresh mushrooms are legal in the UK, and when I used to live there, I have known people who have taken mushrooms. Unfortunately, they all simply end up having whacky experiences that they are not mentally and emotionally prepared to handle. Plus, I cannot for the life of me understand how people can eat those things. They actually smell of rotting flesh and blood. Just smelling them makes me want to puke.
<br>
<br>
In any event, the crux of this whole thing is not merely to have whacky experiences. It's all about learning how to become a serious practitioner of the art. In my view, the drugs aspect is highly detrimental to our credibility in our becoming of a legitimate science.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I strongly believe in Jung's collective unconscious (subconsious). I have had personal experiences on mushrooms myself where my friends and I could see what eachother was thinking.
<br>
<br>
Its possible that it is all one coincidence of relation between our un/subconsious minds, or that we percieve and translate it into our own conception of reality, but I highly doubt that either is likely. Regardless, any collective consciousness can only be percieved from ones consciousness (unless transcending whatever barriers distinguish between ones consciousness and anything else)

Where would I be able to find more information on this? I have had even more experiences of thinking the same thing as another person, and we seem to be going through drastic physical and mental changes a lot lately, any links would be appreciated. thx
