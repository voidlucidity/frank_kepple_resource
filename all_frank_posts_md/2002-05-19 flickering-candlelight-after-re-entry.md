Hello all,
<br>
<br>
This might be addressed in Astral Dynamics, but I'm halfway through it and haven't read anything about this.  It's the way reality looks/feels after the vibrations stop and I'm stuck in my physical body (which is what happens to me most of the time).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the vibrations stop, and there I am, flat on my back on my bed, with a peaceful, floating, totally relaxed feeling, which is SOOO nice, since I've just spent the last minute like this:

OHMIGOD SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!

</font>
As you can see, for many years I had no idea what was going on with this nighttime paralysis.
<br>
<br>
In this peaceful reverie after the paralysis passes, my usually dark bedroom seems lit with flickering lights, almost as if someone had snuck (sneaked?)  into my bedroom and lit a bunch of tea candles and hid them around my room.  In fact, the first time it happened, I thought I'd left candles lit and I rummaged about my room looking for them, getting REALLY confused . . . even more confused than I had been originally for just having an OBE without knowing it.
<br>
<br>
After a minute or two, the candelight effect goes away, and it all feels REAL over with.  Does anyone else experience this?  Any theories as to its source or possible utility?
<br>

Hmm
<br>
That sounds really cool.
<br>
Wish I could help
<br>
<br>
Maybe they are some type of spirits or (if you believe in them) elementals.

Hi Tisha,
<br>
<br>
There are many different things that you could experience, multiply that by
<br>
all the people in this world, and the options seem endless.
<br>
When the vibrations have passed, and you're totally relaxed and feel light
<br>
on the bed, it is a good time to start raising energy. Like powering up for
<br>
flight. If you're seeing elements of light in your room you may be close to
<br>
projection, and just need to focus more on the brow center.  I've brought
<br>
the vibrations back after having them fade out.  I'm not an expert on raising
<br>
energy, but my breathing seems to do the trick.
<br>
<br>
I've layed there too, looking around quietly,  a couple of times my room turned
<br>
into a flat screen. It went from a three dimensional visual to something like
<br>
looking at a photograph. I could see everything in focus, all at once, like a
<br>
5 by 7 picture of my room was right in front of my face. ( facinating...)
<br>
<br>
Take care,
<br>
Nightflier...
<br>

What you are experiencing is just "stray energy" that you come across around the onset of projection. You can see colours, or shapes, or hear pops and bangs and so forth. At first people tend to perceive these as coming from outside the body. Which is only natural.
<br>
<br>
When I first started projecting I would hear all kinds of things which often would make me physically get up and search for the source of the noise. At the time I would have sworn there was someone marching up and down the stairs, or the bedroom door just slammed shut, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Reason being, your collective sense of conscious awareness is SO used to being connected to the physical. To the extent where, on hearing some loud pop or bang, it instantly assumes the sound to have come from outside the body.
<br>
<br>
It's the same with stray visual energy too. Your sense of conscious awareness automatically assumes that what you are viewing is outside the body. But it is easily possible, due to "mind split" effects, to have Astral visions superimposed on ordinary visions of the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is mighty confusing at first and I can well understand you looking around you room for candles and such. So many times I got up to switch a light off and found myself in a total muddle thinking, "Err, what light, I could have sworn there was a light on a moment ago."
<br>
<br>
It also works the other way around, too.
<br>
<br>
When I'm on the Astral, I sometimes find myself looking at a vision of my bedroom superimposed on the Astral scenary. Which is very confusing, initially, as you are not sure which body you are in; in the sense that you have to take a moment to ask yourself, "Now, am I on the Astral imagining I'm in the Physical... or... am I in the Physical imagining I'm on the Astral?
<br>
<br>
But, again, it's just a kind of "mind split" effect that you get used to after a while.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
