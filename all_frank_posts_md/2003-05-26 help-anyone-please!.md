Hey guys. I'm so glad i found this site. It's amazing, really. I'm really happy that i found this site. I could go on....anyways, i'm nto telekinesis. I got the inspiration from my dad, tv serial- Charmed and my best buddy. My dad used to talk to me about telekinesis (TK) but i didnt really give that much of attention to it becoz i was only 14(i guess) and had all other things in mind. When i watched Charmed i saw one of the sisters Prue Halliwell. She's got the power of TK. It's amazing as to how she can move things by her mind and hands. And then my best buddy. He knows a lot about these things- about the magical realm- i won't go into detail. The thing i want to know is i'm practicing TK. Once when i was concentrating hard on the pencil, i FELT it moved a bit. I used the word 'felt' becoz sometimes when i look constantly at a thing i think it moves becoz the eyes can play tricks. Ok, so maybe the pencil moved or maybe it didn't. Today i tried again to move a pencil. I think it was moving, but i can't be sure. I'm very determined to get myself do TK. Not to impress anyone or to show-off, but i really WANT to do it. Another thing is when i'm concentrating at an object, i try not to blink and this causes my eyes to water a bit. My best bud says its becoz i'm "concentrating too hard on concentrating" . Maybe...so what i wanted to ask all you people is that do u have any tips on TK? I know, i know, u'll probably give me links to sites which have tips and all, (i've read them all ) OR u'll probably say that i have to meditate and all- i understand. But the thing is i want to know the tips from you guys- some who have experienced TK or maybe some who are practicing it.
<br>
Please guys, share ypur tips with me.
<br>
And secondly, what's the best thing to practice TK on?- a pencil or a small-very small ball of paper?

In case you didn't know there is a search facility which enables you to look up past posts based on a keyword. There have been a number of previous discussions on this very topic (not that I know all that much about it) but here's one I dug out which may help:

OK!.......TK,
<br>
<br>
It's about as usefull as an ashtray on a motorcycle......it looks good but has no actual purpose.
<br>
<br>
My tip to you is to try moving yourself instead of objects, try evolving above the search for powers of anykind, try finding yourself and raising your consciousness, watching TV shows can't be considered a useful excercise to get anywhere upon this road which is difficult enough without prue Halliwell adding her useless 2 cents and distracting you from your real goal.
<br>
<br>
be warned.....your wasting your time, and even if you succeed...big deal, it will serve you not if you wish to evolve. Evolution requires the negation of powers, so in my book you are barking up the wrong tree.
<br>
<br>
Sorry

sure it has purpose. you can get a (CENSORED) pop (/CENSORED [

]) out of the fridge without having to get up. [

<br>
<br>
but really, if you want to start ascribing how useful something might be, then think about all the things that you can already do and try to understand for yourself just how "useful" they are in your life. try to understand just what they really do for you in the end.
<br>
<br>
but like i said on another thread: i don't think any of these powers really matter in the end, you still die. and so it is better (as far as i believe) for a person to continue along a path towards spiritual development and let these things come second, do them when you're on break from your spiritual journey [|)], or do them in "coordination" with your spiritual journey.
<br>
<br>
and lastly: i've discovered a new way to practice tk. get a piece of paper, fold it in half, unfold it but keep it "bent" so that it's at like a 140 degree angle and let it rest on a flat surface. you should notice by then that one half of the paper is elevated while the other is flat on the surface: you're task, should you choose to accept it ([|)]) is to *push* the elevated half down to the desk using only the powers of your mind (or spirit if you use chi rather than psi).
