Hi there,
<br>
I am interested if other people record their own voices for the purpose of assisting with visualisation/exploration. I am reading bruce moens's books, and also studying Robert's N.E.W material. Sometimes I find it hard to read an exercise and then try and remember it as i do it, so would like to be talked through the exercises (a bit like the Hemi-sync tapes).
<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have advice on this.
<br>
<br>
many thanks,
<br>
<br>
Patrick.

I've often thought of doing this and one time I decided to give it a go. But the stumbling block was lack of any quality recording equipment. If person had the right equipment they could marry the sounds produced by BW-Gen with their own voice commands. The doing of which could have lots of potential IMO.
<br>
<br>
The one big problem with the Gateway series CD (although I've long-since become accustomed) is Monroe's voice had a "Houston mission control" feel about it. Especially during the countdown! I kept chuckling at visions of space-rockets on launch pads.
<br>

Hi Frank,
<br>
I agree about the count-down sequences in Monroe tapes. Are those counting sequences really usefull, or is just better to go at one's own pace and ignore them?
<br>
<br>
I might try some recordings tonight. Will be into my PC or Mini disk, so quality will probably be suss..
<br>
<br>
thanks,
<br>
Pat.

Yes, I found the countdown sequence to be very effective once I got used to it. Though it did take me quite a while to train myself to work closely with the CD.

Unfortunatly i cant listen to my own voice like that. It sounds very deep and peacefull in the confines of my mind and i find self-hypnosis to be no problem.If i tried to listen to it on a tape however, it'd be all i could do not to burst out laughing!

I don't think this would be a problem. Any normal PC microphone shoould be able to record ".WAV" format files and which can be overlaid onto a BWGEN pre-set. The quality of the instructions should easily be good enough - it is the BWGEN part that needs to be, and indeed is high quality.
<br>
<br>
I think it is an excellent idea, and well worth pursuing!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hi Adrian,
<br>
I did some experiments the other night with microphone into my pc. Quality was ok, as long as you're in a quite room, though I had to turn 'boost' on for my voice to be picked up properly.
<br>
<br>
If I get time this weekend I will try to construct a tape.
<br>
Just got my hands on 'Astral Dynamics' book so have had my head stuck in pages.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
<br>
Pat.
