<section>
I have hinted at a question and no one has really answered so I'll ask again.  For people who project regularly and have "controlled" projections where do you start?
<br>
<br>
It may seem simple but I really dont know where to go or how to go about finding a locale where I can visit on a regular basis.  Maybe part of it is the fact I still think im dreaming, but even then I often find myself searching for something I dont remember finding in MOST projections.
<br>
<br>
Do you have to have a guide first?  Do you focus on a location and go there then have a set plan on what to do?  What is a controlled projection?  Where did you start when you decided to plan out your projections?
<br>
<br>
Any advice would help

For a controlled, conscious-exit projection you start from C1 (Physical).

Chances are highly likely the reason for this is because you haven't yet brought your degree of realisation ability, and sense of conscious awareness up to the requisite levels. At the very minimum, these two factors need to be at least at the same level a normal person would experience while awake and alert on the Physical.

It helps, but it's by no means necessary. I think it boils down to what suits each individual. I tend to go through phases where I might project on my own for a few weeks, just projecting for the joy of it. But doing so tends to accumulate all kinds of questions; especially when I find myself getting out of my depth; or I come across some phenomenon I haven't seen before.
<br>
<br>
So then I'll go through a phase of projecting with a guide (usually my regular, Harath) to get answers and advice. But after a week or so of daily lectures on this and that, I'll get the yearning to go freestyle again. And so the cycle repeats.

With me, I tend not to focus on locations. I focus more on seeking answers to questions, or clarification on matters which I feel are important to me. Then I hold this in mind as the projection experience is unfolding. Once I have been to a location several times to the extent that I know what the place looks like then, yes, I can simply picture the location and off I go.

The full term is: controlled, conscious-exit projection. It describes an experience which begins at C1 and progresses through various, recognisable inbetween states (Focus levels, in Monroe-speak), and finally ends up within the Astral at a place of the person's choosing. Performed correctly, at no time during this process should a person either lose consciousness, or lose control of the experience. It should be one smooth and controlled transition.

With me I found it all works much better if I concentrate more on getting answers to questions, or seeking clarification on matters that are important to me; as opposed to thinking about the actual projection process.
<br>
<br>
Projection is an exclusively mental process so having the right kind of "thoughts" is crucial. Having the right Intent, or Desire is very important when it comes to kick-starting the process. Any kind of Doubt, puts a *major* spoke in the works, of course.

Thanks Frank that helped a lot.
<br>
<br>
Im curious do you think phasing is perhaps more controlled and a better way to come about having regular controlled, conscious-exit projections?  It seems one benefit would be the stages and how well they're explained in monroe's method.

James: I wish I had a definitive answer, but it really does depend on the individual.
<br>
<br>
Okay, that may sound a bit wishy-washy but it that's really how I feel about it. I'm very much in-tune with the Monroe-school. I think that is because I first got into all this from chance reading Monroe's JOB around 25 years ago.
<br>
<br>
Someone in 20-odd years time may well be post the same about Robert Bruce's Astral Dynamics: and talk about how basic "energy work" led to their success, etc., etc. In the same way now people such as Ginny rave about the Moen-School.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, it really is down to each individual to mix and match concepts they feel comfortable with

 and broadcast their experiences

. The last bit is in italics because I feel it's the most important part.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
