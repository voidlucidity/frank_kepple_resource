I know it's probably been done to death, but I wondered what everyone thinks about the possibility of entering the astral world via lucid dreaming techniques.
<br>
<br>
You see, I have a RIDICULOUS amount of various recurring dreams (every night, pretty much), and I just wondered whether I could utilise this by trying to become lucid when I recognise them. This happened to me recently, and the sensations were exactly as I've felt during more traditional, spontaneous OBE's - I felt my body in my bed, and had the difficulty waking/coming back in that I do when I project spontaneously etc.
<br>
<br>
I just wonder if this could be a "way in" for me, a technique that might give me more luck with my struggle to consciously project?

Hi Meg, hows things ?!
<br>
<br>
First, I have not been able to project yet. Below is what I've learnt through others' experiences.
<br>
<br>
Projecting from a lucid dream is possible, I think it is a case of becoming AWARE of the sensations of projection whilst in a lucid state....Others may want to speak from their own experiences on this.
<br>
<br>
A recurring dream is a great opportunity. Lets say I have a recurring dream where I fall down some stairs, and there is a cat at the bottom. In order to become lucid, all I've got to do is make myself aware that as soon as I see the cat, I realise I'm dreaming.
<br>
<br>
This is my technique : replay the scenario a few times during my waking hours each day, and when I get to see the cat, tell myself "this is a dream, wake up! "
<br>
<br>
Now you'll be lucid, and in a position to project....

Waking up in a dream is how I first came to discover the Astral, and I used this technique for many years. The way you practice is to check yourself every 15 minutes, or so, on the Physical. You need to do some little action and, at the same time, confirm that you are in your physical body. I used to tap my foot or hand a couple of times and say, "Confirmed, in my physical body."
<br>
<br>
After a while, this will come into a dream. You will do the same action but the result will be different than normal. This is designed to stimulate your curiosity. Hopefully, it will be aroused to the point where it will awaken your critical faculties in order to investigate further. There will probably be a few minutes of confusion and, if it all works to plan, you should realise you are dreaming. But the next bit is the most important part of the technique and is perhaps the trickiest to do (at the time).
<br>
<br>
At the point of realisation, you need to quickly close off any emotional release; as it will have been emotional release that was causing the initial dream you just came out of. Then, no matter what you "see" around you, remain as still (in both a physical and a mental sense) as possible. That way, any remnants of the original dreamscape will dissipate, leaving you free to navigate the Astral proper.
<br>
<br>

Thanks guys.
<br>
<br>
It hadn't struck me before, but I remember being a teenager and using a kind of "checking in" device to test if I was dreaming or not.  I used to have this silly oversized light switch on the wall just above my bed, and if it didn't switch on, I knew that I was really still sleeping. Anyway, that is a fantastic idea. Thankyou, Frank. And it's really nice to be able to give a context to all those little experiences!

projecting from the dreamstate is fairly easy from waht i remember. usually the exit sensations aren't the same or they are omitted. the advice about the waking hour practice is right on. also maybe you would want to try reminding yourself to try and project as soon as you see that cat or whatever. this may bypass the emotional drawback that causes you to lose lucidity in a dream. it's kinda hard at first to keep your emotions neutral when you realize what's going on. i suggest using a stabilizing tek as soon as you realize that you are dreaming/projecting. looking at your hands would be great if you were dreaming. gl fred
