Do you have to believe that AP is real to actually do it? I have been hearing alot of people say you need motivation or whatnot, and think it is real or something. Is it true? Because I'm an Agnostic, so I really don't believe either way, I'm trying to research God and many supernatural phenomena. I want to AP to see if it is either A. A load of sh*t B. Real or C. Can't know,, so I thought what better way to see which it is than to go and actually do it! Thanks.

No, you don't need belief in AP to do it. You just need patience, curiosity, and to keep at it. I didn't believe it was real until I experienced it.
<br>
<br>
I'm still an agnostic and I have had quite a few "astral" experiences.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I don't know how you can research any of it without actually doing it. The way I teach is not that hard. It doesn't require any particular beliefs. In fact beliefs just get in the way mostly and I think that's what scuppers a lot of people. So much so I'd even suggest you drop your beliefs of "astral" projection and merely learn to switch your focus of attention from the physical to Focus 2 of consciousness, and go from there.
<br>
<br>
I first got into this from by chance coming across Monroe's Journeys OotB some 22 years ago. After reading it a couple of times I figured the guy was either insane, or he had come across something important. I had no religious beliefs at all. I thought religion was just a load of bunkum, just an excuse to wage war with each other, and had never come across anything like it before. I hadn't got a "new age bone" in my body, and still don't have. But just happened to see the book and thought the cover looked interesting. On sheer impulse I bought it. Like I say, I thought the guy was either insane or he had cottoned onto something important. I wasn't sure which conclusion was the most apt so I gave his technique a try.
<br>
<br>
Much to my surprise I began getting some definite effects and the rest, as they say, is history.
<br>
<br>
So you could say that on the one hand I was not a believer, as such. But on the other hand I was not dismissing it entirely. I was merely curious as to which of my conclusions was the most apt. I had no particular favour for either one. Okay, it was surprising that I received some definite effects. But this was more light-hearted surprise as opposed to a surprise founded on a definite bias to the contrary. Because knowing what I know now, I think that if I had begun from the standpoint of being biased towards Monroe being insane, this would have precluded me from having the experiences that I did. My saying that is pure conjecture, of course. But it does appear the case that a person's ability to perceive is directly proportional to their
<i>
 willingness
</i>
to believe.
<br>
<br>
So if you are simply not willing to believe it, then you close off any channel of communication. Here we get a steady throughput of sceptics who have locked themselves in this kind of mode. No matter what the evidence to the contrary, they are simply not willing to believe it, so none of it they shall experience, simple as that. But you have to be very careful when treading to the contrary.
<br>
<br>
If you are willing to believe the "astral" is populated by all manner of "angels" and "gods" and whatever, if that is what you are willing to believe then all manner of angels and gods you shall perceive. Likewise with "devils and demons" too. And this is unfortunately what scuppers many of the mystics and their followers alike.
<br>
<br>
So somehow you have to tread that fine line.
<br>
<br>
You have to be open to it, so you don't close yourself off from having these experiences. But don't be willing to believe to the point of
<i>
 gullibility
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
In a way it's like the physical.
<br>
<br>
If you never trust anyone, not one iota, not ever. Then you would have a very strange and difficult life. We have to trust people to a degree. So if I were in a strange town and politely asked a stranger for directions to the nearest bank for the Â£10,000 cash deposit I needed to make, then it would be reasonable to trust that person to direct me in a genuine fashion. But to hand them the money and a credit slip, and ask them to pay it in for me, on account of the fact that I had to rush off somewhere, would be the height of folly.
<br>
<br>
So the same principle applies in your willingness to believe.
<br>
 <br>
  That is why I follow a more scientific line of enquiry. This has stood me in good stead in my attempts to find out what actually IS, as opposed to merely revelling in my own belief constructs ABOUT what is.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hence the notion of astral travel or astral projection is a mystical belief construct with layer upon layer of all manner of (often) weird and whacky notions attached. But what I always suggest for people to do is drop all that, and simply learn how to switch your focus of attention from Focus 1 to Focus 2.
  <u>
   Nothing more than that
  </u>
  . Just practice that simple transition. Once you get in the habit of being able to do that, you can then use Focus 2 of consciousness as a launch-pad to doing whatever else it is you want to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  I can teach you how to transition to other areas from Focus 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, you will find it a *lot* easier transitioning into what is often called a real-time-zone projection from Focus 2, than Focus 1. Many people plug away trying to do this from the physical. But transitioning to Focus 2 *first* and then transitioning back to the physical into the "real time zone" may sound a bit of a roundabout way of doing it. But I say it's a lot easier, overall. But why bother messing about in the physical? After all, we live in the physical normally and the novelty of walking through walls and floating on the ceiling, if my experience is any yardstick, is it simply gets
  <i>
   boring
  </i>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  Far better to transition to Focus 3. This is where people shift their Primary Focus to when they "die" physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  What we objectively view as death is, in fact, the action of a person permanently disengaging their Primary Focus from Focus 1 of consciousness to Focus 3. You can shift your focus of attention to the upper branches of Focus 3 and chat to these people. Many times I have received information from people about their lives and have managed to check its authenticity from searching the Internet. So if you are into research then Focus 3 is where you want to be. You will have a fun time researching there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yours,
  <br>
  Frank

<section>
Thanks for all your comments, especially Franks. Perhaps I should clarify what my posistion is regarding AP. I don't believe or disbelieve in AP, I don't know if its real or not, so thats why I want to experience it, to see what it is with my own two eyes. So, basically, I don't have any beliefs either way, and according to most of the posts here, I should be good to go, thank you. Oh and Frank, do you have MSN or Yahoo, I would like to add you to my list so that we may discuss AP further, If you so desire. Thanks.
