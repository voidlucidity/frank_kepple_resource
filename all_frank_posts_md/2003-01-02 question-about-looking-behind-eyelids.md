OK, here's one thing I've been meaning to ask for a long time.
<br>
<br>
You know how you're meant to "look behind your eyelids", and at first you see flat blackness, then when you're at Focus 12 it turns 3D etc.? OK, here are some questions:
<br>
<br>
1) I don't know if it's the same with everyone, but for me, **either** I actually MAKE AN EFFORT to SEE, LOOK, and FOCUS ON the blackness, **or** my mind is somewhere else and my eye senses are shut down.
<br>
So when I'm required to "look behind my eyelids", are you saying that all the while, from beginning to end, I'm meant to be consciously lookind/seeing/focussing with my eyes?
<br>
<br>
2) I'm pretty sure this is true with everyone - when you close your eyelids (whether in sleep or just relaxing), your eyeballs actually ROLL UP, so that it's looking up into somewhere in the cranium.
<br>
You will hardly notice this, but I'm sure it's true cos for people who can't completely shut their eyelids when they sleep, you can see only the white of the eye peeking through. Or you can test yourself: shut your eyes, and use your hands to physically peel open your eyelids. You will notice your eyes are facing upwards.
<br>
So my question is, we're not meant to LITERALLY look "behind the eyelids", right?? Cos if I were to literally do that, I would have to strain my eyes to bring the eyeballs back down from its naturally rested position. My eyelids would then start to feel strained and shaky, and even flutter.
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>

I had a few questions of my own...
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Does anyone else see outlines of the room or objects with your eyes closed?  For me when I close my eyes I can see the outline of my arms or hands moving. Also I can see the shape of my room and some other things. My eyes are definetly closed when I percieve these things and Im wondering if other people are experiencing the same things?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

Mayhem - yes! I get exactly the same thing. I keep thinking that I can see depth whilst my eyes are closed, but I then realise that this depth is exactly the same shape as my room.
<br>
<br>
Could it be some kind of afterimage? Or perhaps vision through the 3rd eye? I doubt the 3rd eye for me, as I haven't got very far with NEW and am still doing work on the secondary chakras. Or could it be that our eyes are just ever so slightly open, and this forms an image of depth combined with blackness?
<br>
<br>
Thoughts welcome!

I'd still like to know what you guys DO with your eyes when you close them. Are you actually "looking" and focussing on the blackness? Or do you just relax the eyes (like how you would when you go so sleep) and try to perceive whatever comes to the mind?
<br>
<br>
Do you understand the distinction I'm trying to make here?

Considering I posted in your topic I'll try to answer your question. Generally I relax my eyes completly. I suppose you could focus on the darkness. Most people say clearing your mind is the best and focusing on something doesn't seem possible while doing that. Also for your information Monroe Wave I - Introduction to Focus 10 has you relax your jaw, forehead, cheeks, eyelids and your eyes. Relaxing your body is a given ( I'd think). The closest I've been to projecting is when I almost fell asleep and somehow came to right before deep sleep set in. I was completly aware and in control of my intent, while my body was completly asleep. It was the most awesome feeling and somewhat indescribable. Sleep paralysis can be somewhat scarey if you're not prepared for it. Good luck hope that helps.

Yes, I understand the distinction.
<br>
<br>
Basically, the eyes should be relaxed. What you allow yourself to do is shift your focal point of awareness from behind the eyes up into your head. That's where the Astral is. Well, the connection I mean.
<br>
<br>
When you first close your eyes, you will be looking at the back of your eyelids. This is the 2D blackness stage. But if you let the eyes relax your mental focus will shift upwards. As it does so, you begin to perceive whatever is coming into mind as you say. The shifting occurs as the physical body drifts off to sleep and you keep your sense of consciousness awake.
<br>
<br>
As your mental focus shifts progressively more away from the Physical and into the Astral, that is when the blackness takes on a 3D effect. But at this point, this is not the same blackness you were looking at upon first closing your eyes. In the sense that blackness has in some way switched from 2D to 3D (though this is how it comes across). But the 3D blackness comes from a different area of consciousness which has got nothing to do with the physical eyes.
<br>
<br>
Also, the 3D blackness is not something you focus upon. It is more like something you find yourself within, rather than something you look at.
<br>
