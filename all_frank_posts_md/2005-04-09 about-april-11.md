Hi! I was sent the message below.
<br>
<br>
For those who have studied Cleve Backsters work they know the power of thought and emotion.
<br>
Here is some information:

<br>
<br>
Please read through this letter before April 11 because it could be so very very important.
<br>
<br>
THANK YOU!
<br>
<br>
The letter:
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing happens by chance. I believe that Divine providence has put you
<br>
across
<br>
our path.  The One needs you as much as you need the One, for all is
<br>
One.  Please
<br>
read and send ASAP everywhere the message below posted on the website
<br>
at
<br>
www.probablefuture.com/The_Final_Embrace.htm
<br>
<br>
Use the language that you feel is best to reach many.
<br>
It will take a little moment of your time and the rewards will be
<br>
plentiful.
<br>
<br>
We are all here for a purpose. You are all here to bring it about:
<br>
Unity in
<br>
Oneness. Let us become the silent vehicle of a new and better connected
<br>
inner and
<br>
outer
<br>
world. Let us show the power of infinite Love over any darkness!
<br>
<br>
Let us meet on April 11 across time and space!
<br>
<br>
Let us show how powerful Remote Influencing can become when done with a
<br>
high
<br>
purpose of Unity!
<br>
<br>
Thank you
<br>
<br>
In Oneness

 'Recent Remote viewing sessions from teams of Remote Viewers from the
 <br>
  Academy have shown a proximate probable future that we feel should be
  <br>
   communicated.  It is not our habit to spoon-feed a constant litany of
   <br>
    horrific
    <br>
    end-of-
    <br>
    times scenarios as many remote viewers have done. We see no need to add
    <br>
    to the
    <br>
    general addiction to fear which has grappled mankind lately. If you
    <br>
    feel that this
    <br>
    message is about fear, then please read it again and again. This is not
    <br>
    about
    <br>
    events, judgment, but about the panacea to erase fear, and suffering.
    <br>
    You all
    <br>
    carry this Infinite Force within. NOW is the time to manifest it.
    <br>
    '.........
    <br>
    <br>
    'I am going to ask you, wherever you are located on this planet, to
    <br>
    connect twice
    <br>
    on 4/11 (April 11, 2005) in silence to your deepest core and heart, for
    <br>
    11 minutes
    <br>
    each, from 11 AM (morning time) up to 11:11 AM,  and for another 11
    <br>
    minutes
    <br>
    again from 11 PM (night time) up to 11:11 PM. As the planet rotates
    <br>
    during its 24
    <br>
    hour cycle, it will create, through the many of you living in all its
    <br>
    time zones,
    <br>
    a
    <br>
    great field of consciousness of Unity that will powerfully help lift,
    <br>
    and
    <br>
    transmute the
    <br>
    dark field of separation and fear which is now covering so densely our
    <br>
    beautiful
    <br>
    and fragile home: Earth, separating us from the Inner Kingdom of
    <br>
    Heavens.  I
    <br>
    would like you to enter the moment when 11:11 shows up on your clock,
    <br>
    morning
    <br>
    and evening all around this planet, in a state of total communion with
    <br>
    the One
    <br>
    Unified Field which we all represent and are parts of.'.....
    <br>
    <br>
    'For 11 minutes each, on the morning and evening of April 11, I will
    <br>
    ask you to
    <br>
    open your heart in perfect abandon and trust, and invite within your
    <br>
    being a force
    <br>
    of pure unrestricted love which lies now deeply entombed within it. It
    <br>
    has never
    <br>
    left you, but you have, for the most part and for eons, not been aware
    <br>
    of its
    <br>
    presence. Please, call upon It to pervade your awareness, your total
    <br>
    being, and
    <br>
    chase away all illusions of fear. Bathe in its loving embrace. It is
    <br>
    only through
    <br>
    opening your heart to its magnificent presence that you will experience
    <br>
    within and
    <br>
    project then without the Divine Feminine force which has been called so
    <br>
    often The
    <br>
    Christ, Holy Spirit, Bindu point, The Great Spirit, Shakti, Ruach
    <br>
    Hakodesh, Cosmic
    <br>
    Consciousness, Shekinah, Sakinah etc... You do not need to name It
    <br>
    unless you
    <br>
    feel more comfortable doing so.  This is the Real Power of total
    <br>
    unconditional
    <br>
    Love.
    <br>
    It is the quality of total acceptance of who we are and have become,
    <br>
    and the
    <br>
    Divine aspect totally void of judgment. '.....
    <br>
    <br>
    'As the Asian tsunami and the latest earth-movements and energy
    <br>
    releases have
    <br>
    hinted lately, the 'ring of fire' in the Pacific rim is being
    <br>
    activated, and the
    <br>
    tectonic
    <br>
    plates of our Mother Earth are being restructured. We have remote
    <br>
    viewed
    <br>
    probable futures which strongly pointed out  that if we do not accept
    <br>
    our Loving
    <br>
    Unity soon, much fracture will be shown manifesting our dis-connected
    <br>
    state from
    <br>
    the state of  Union in Oneness. Tremendous rumblings will be felt
    <br>
    throughout the
    <br>
    One Unified Field.  We ask the scientific community to closely monitor
    <br>
    any unusual
    <br>
    pattern in the migratory behavior of whales, dolphins, and birds, for
    <br>
    they will be
    <br>
    much more predictive of locations where potential large-scale energy
    <br>
    releases
    <br>
    might happen than any current scientific monitoring apparatus. Also
    <br>
    please
    <br>
    monitor any unusual tidal patterns. This only addresses bad-case
    <br>
    scenarios, but
    <br>
    the time has come to become highly aware of their proximate potential.
    <br>
    Please let
    <br>
    us avoid such painful re-alignment!
    <br>
    <br>
    All we need to do is so simple:  Re-member all the pieces that we form
    <br>
    in the
    <br>
    Unity
    <br>
    of the Being of The One. Do it not out of fear, for it will negate it,
    <br>
    but out of
    <br>
    a deep
    <br>
    yearning for Limitless and Unconditional Love. Cry and laugh all you
    <br>
    can at the
    <br>
    same time. '....

Ha ha, how is it when these religious types call for us to "unite" they always want us to do it in accordance with their particular set of belief-system constraints? Nothing personal and no offence meant, but there's just something about that which gets up my nose! LOL

Without separation there would be no fun, and no reason at all to exist. I'd rather die than seek this kind of "spiritual unification". The world evolution would stagnate...

I don´t know what he means with oneness exactly. But if you read about Cleve Backsters work and modern physics you see. Like Entanglement.

I know he is right about the Kabbalistic cube so that is why i suspect more things are correct. Read about numerology an sacred geometry and then see the patterns in time irl.
<br>
<br>
I would guess we are like our body. Both a larger one and indivudual cells that need to work together to make the larger body survive.

<section>
All in all, the only thing I can really resonate with is the talk of a "divine feminine force". Yes, that would be nice. A bit of divine femininity washing all over me right now would be rather welcome!

It won't hurt me any to stop talking at myself for 11 minutes, twice on the same day. The trick will be remembering to do it. With other people doing it at the same time, with the intent of being connected together, it should be easier than usual.
