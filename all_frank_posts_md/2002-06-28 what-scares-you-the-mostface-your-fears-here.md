<br>
<br>
Myself, im alright with my obes'I get a little scared, when im starting to fall deep in the trance.And I remind myself sometimes that the only thing I have to fear is fear itself.Once im out all my fears stay

<br>
<br>
But what really frightens me sometimes is my minds eye visions.Some of them are so clear.Ive had some pretty strange ones.Mostly people I see,And this weird blue man the other night scared me with yellow hair*shrug*.And its the way they come out of no where.And most of them are totally unrelated to me.I dont know what they mean.I dont know where they are coming from?The voices are alright I know they are from people sleepin.For they have only happened to me late at night.But those visions spook me alot.I told you mine lets hear yours!

One more thing the lucid dreams,the ones that play out your fears.I guess these are suppose to scare you.Them too...lol

My biggest fear has been fearing the unknown. When I first started projecting this was a big issue for me. The first few times I got out I would get so afraid because I did not know what to expect I jumped back into my body. This is really not bad now. Sometimes, if I have gone a long time without projecting, I will start feeling a little afraid when I first start trying to project. But I quickly put this aside, especially once I start to feel the vibrations and start to separate. You never really know what you are going to experience when you get out. Sometimes it can be totally different than anything you can imagine. I have learned to accept this, or still trying to at times.

<section>
I fear control the most, or rather loosing it.
<br>
I like to feel like I am in control of my life, my emotions, and the things that effect those the most.
<br>
I do not like the idea of some one else "doing the driving".
<br>
<br>
This can be a big problem at times since there are instances where control needs to be given to another or perhaps removed to feel the full effect of the situation.  While developing this problem comes in the way of not understanding something at first.  When things just happen and I don't know how or why.  There is no control over the situation and I tend to pull myself away.
<br>
I understand that some times you need to just let things happen, and let them happen a few times untill understanding and control are established.  But there in lies my problem, I want to be able to control it first, so then I can decide if it is some thing that I want to do or not.

I was raised catholic.
<br>
<br>
My biggest fear is that the catholic church is right and my instincts are wrong. I'd kind of hate to go to hell because of the path I am choosing.
<br>
<br>
I don't see anything negative when I am out, although often things are kind of murky - sort of dark and hazy.  I am guessing it is a reflection of my inner state, and as that continues to clear, so will the experiences. When I was young I would 'see' the sort of creatures that you mention and they ARE frightening sometimes, I am glad I haven't seen them in a while.

yes I know im afraid of the unknown too,especially in real life.The best thing you can do I think is to expect nothing.That way whatever you get will always be something.If you expect something, it just makes things harder for

expect too  much and you get disappointed,because youll never get that much.And this was especially hard for me.Not really to do with obes'.But In the real world.I would expect the worst.This is bad and I got out of this habit.For when bad things do happen,it just makes it seem that much worst.Even though they are never as bad as you expect.

Cainam:
<br>
I understand,Ive felt the same way throughout my life.And my obes' sometimes.But I think we have to learn to trust our higher self.I had a lucid dream where I was in my living room,And I just spontaneously flew out of my body.And I saw my physical body get up on its own.And it went and grabbed on to my girlfriend.And started hugging her and spinning her around like dancing.This scared me very much.I was afraid  my physical body was going to hurt her.I could see all this happening from my astral body.And I woke up gasping for my breath.This helped me know to not be afraid of not being in control.But I still am,I guess.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel as if my life is already written.Everything thats going to happen,will happen.Just the way it was meant to be.All I have to do is let

<br>
Hope this helps,pay attention to your lucid dreams.The ones that scare you.They will show how it was meant to be.Ive had many and they are telling me that I shouldnt be afraid of anything.But this is not easy for ive been afraid of these things since I can remember.But im working on them.
<br>
<br>
You might find yourself having those lucid dreams now,,they will have to do with these fears you just posted up.Your higher self is always listening I think.And  few times after I posted something I was afraid of on here.That same night I would have one regarding the same things.GOOD LUCK!!!!!!

Hi !
<br>
<br>
What is scaring me ?  It's stupid...
<br>
<br>
I'm scared to be scared...
<br>
<br>
I don't know how to explain, it's easier to me in french.
<br>
<br>
When I have OBE, I'm afraid to see monsters and things like that.  But I know that if I think about these things, I can even imagine them and be afraid because of my fears...

I'm working to take it easy.

<br>
It took me awhile to get over

 that.It
</a>
made it easier for me to know that they have always been there all my life.(negs).Even if you cant feel  them than.I knew my neg thoughts would drain me eventually..They are always around waiting for you to get scared.All they do is suck that fear out of you.
<br>
<br>
If you are in a good mood you have nothing to worry about.And you have nothing to worry about anyway.They dont really hurt at all.Compared to real physical

may feel a little uncomfortable on your energy body.Ive had a few of them on me.And even tried pulling them off.But its like they become a part of you.All you can really do is try to make yourself feel better.If you are feeling that bad about it.I think if you cry it would work to get them off.
<br>

not really sure of anything anymore.This is just what I lean too at this moment in time.Good luck with your fear!!Hope I didnt make you more scared.
<br>
<br>
Negs arent evil.They just do what they are designed for.Fear is like there fav dessert.And they also like all the other bad emotions I think.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question for anybody who knows:
<br>
Is it possible to suck your energy back from a neg?

You know oddly enough I also tend to fear being in water by myself.  Like in a lake, pool, or the ocean.  When I am around others I don't get that way but when alone I always feel as if something is going to come out of the nothing and pull me under.

My girlfriend was with me and she didnt like the seaweed.She noticed that there were little  green worm like creatures in it.And they were getting on her skin.They are kinda like mosquitos.And sting a little when they bite.I seen them on me.And felt there little bites.But I didnt tell her because when she saw them on her.There she went running

hey robin I cant really relate to that one,ive never actually seen a ghost in real life.Maybe I have but I just dont remember.But could it have been a relative of yours that past away?Maybe he/she didnt mean any harm and just wanted to bid you farewell.Since you are afraid he/she wont visit you again.Because maybe they love you too much and dont want to scare you..I dont know this is just what I thought  of first when I read your post.

I think if it was something bad.Then it would  be back to frighten you even

Hi A lot of people have said the same thing to me like it was most likely a family member but...
<br>
I don't think it was a good spirit because I looked up the hallway and saw the male ghost walk in my bedroom and my record player started and it was turned all the way up. I was so scared from seeing him that I was frozen for a second but then I run up the stairs to the front of my room to shut the player off because my mom would have killed me if she came home and heard it blaring.
<br>
<br>
Then (this was during a rain storm) I ran down the stairs and flew out my front door and as I was running to my friends home I was ankle deep in water when lightning struck the tree next to me ands I took a charge from it and fell down and was very sick for days from it.
<br>
<br>
I just have a gut feeling that it was a set up buy Mr. Ghost. I was only 9 and now I am 35 but remember it like it was yesterday.

I hate not knowing what's going on.  I'm not afraid of being out of control, as long as I know The Deal.  My greatest terror in psychic, magickal, or OBE-type situations is when SOMETHING significant is happening, but I don't know what's going on.
<br>
<br>
They were "in my head" once.  Who are "THEY?"  I don't know, just beings scooting into my head and checking it out, perhaps tweaking a gear here and there.  Why?  I DON'T KNOW.  That was a blood-curdling scream of an experience.  I hated it, I thought I was going to die.  If instead these beings had said, "Um, Ma'am, we're gonna get in your head and tweak some gears and gather some data, then we'll leave, so don't worry" I would have felt so much better about the event.  But the episode shocked me so much, I was ready for the psychiatric ward when they were through with me.
<br>
<br>
I used to be afraid of bugs.  I'm not afraid of them any more.  In fact, these days I wonder if there is a thing in the PHYSICAL world that frightens me anymore . . . except when I get premonitions about bad things happening.  Then I get REAL hard to live with.  I suppose it falls along the same lines . . . knowing something significant is happening but not knowing what it is.

heres what I think.This guy you saw.Wasnt really a man at all.He was just some type of neg who could change his shape.When you saw "him",you were very,very scared.Negs eat fear and you gave him all the power he needed to put tthat record player on.I dont think you should tie this and the lightining strike incident together.
<br>
<br>
"He"may of known that it was going to happen.And maybe he knew you were going to blame him,and feed him somemore.I really dont think "he"negs have the power to make lightning strike.If it had that kind of power,it wouldnt bother with a helpless 9 year

About being stuck in infinity,Robert towards the end of his book.He talks about voids in  the astral.I dont know if you read.But he mentions that they are so peaceful and there is nothing to be afraid of at all.Because there is nothing there just blackness.Well something like that. You couldnt get stuck in there I dont think.If you did  eventually you would run out of energy and come back to earth.But you probably mean in the after life.I dont think even the worst people would end up in a place like that......Ive thought of the same thing before...

Well alpha, i know it's hard to do, but you even said it yourself. think back to the happy times.
<br>
<br>
I am not afraid of dying in the slightest, nor i am anyone else.  OK, i will be more upset when my family die, and a lot of them have, you just have to except the inevitable.  We all die some day, but only our physical bodies, your family members will ascend to a higher place, and the only thing you can do is to be happy for them.  They wont forget about you, nor you will them.  You could even say it's everyones destiny to die and return to the astral worlds and higher.  Be happy they actually lived a life on the physical world.  Living an entire full live on this world would get boring i imagine, when you are old, i imagine the only thing you can really look forward to is seeing your loved ones, but when they ascend, they will get more than enough.  So, as i said, it's hard, but try and just let go, accept what will be, and smile.  Like you said, rememeber the happy times, smile and have a laugh about it, and carry on with your life.  That's the good thing about a memory, you can "record" so much data and recall as much as you like, like it's just happened.
<br>
Remember that the physical body is just a shell.  Think of it as, your loved one has moved home to the other side of the planet, and instead of picking up the phone to talk to them, you have to contact them with more difficult means, but it can be done and is done all the time.
<br>
I hope i helped.
<br>
Be happy mate.

alpha Hi sorry I have not replied sooner I have been out of town. Yes you gave me food for though. Thank you.
<br>
<br>
I have had many interesting things happen to me  and my heart tell me that there is more to it and I will find it out in time. This mam was a full size man but foggy white color and transparent. He was wearing a suit even dress shoes. So interesting like many other things we all have experienced.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel it is a way for others to keep us on a spiritual path.
<br>
I would love to hear your experience if you would want to share it.
<br>
<br>
Years ago in  OBE I flew over to a man fishing in knee high water. He and I looked at a water fall/rapids area . . .
<br>
<br>
Then I said I souldn't try that and he said Yes it will be like in PA I mean Delaware and I will be there to get you at the end.
<br>
<br>
To me Ii knew he was someome who cared very much for me and who was with me my whole life!
<br>
<br>
When he said PA he was refering to when I flew to PA to meet my birth mom and when he said Delaware he was refering to a childhood experience I had on the Delaware river when our whole group canoes tiped over on rapids and mine was the only one not to.
<br>
<br>
So I will be ok and have someone who loves me scoop me up in the end to take me home.

Hey, all.
<br>
<br>
I would have to weigh in with alpha's last fears. Fear of things happening to the ones I love and the people I care about are the worst things for me. Second place would be being maimed, but not killed. I.E. quadrapalegic. Death does not scare me, but being dependent for everything does.

Take care

<br>
<br>
But you helped me,and you made me think about it more.Why would they end up in a bad place?Yes they may have alot of hate in them.But its because they are hurting and they are tired of it.Its not anything to do with them.Its just how the world is..everything was already messed up before we were all born...Why should we be responsible for that.....

its ok,Ive been busy anyway:)How you described that guy you saw.Thats the same color of the negs ive seen.All the people in my obes'  are not ghostly lookin.They look like normal people.Only happier...heh,So that makes me even more sure it was a neg.
<br>
<br>
Heres what happened to me.Ill try to make this as short as I
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///can.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 can.It
</a>
all started with one of my earlier obes'.When I first started leaving the real time zone.I ended up talking to this old man.And he told me there was ghosts upstairs in my house.This gave made me a little afraid.I didnt really believe it though.
<br>
<br>
But I guess I was upset one day.I was coming off some anti-anxiety medication.I felt really bad for a few weeks..Im not sure when this was but it was close to that day of the obe.I was in  bed.I think I may have watched a horror movie.And I wasnt feeling to brave.:)There is a small table right against my bed.And there were a few paper cups on it.
<br>
<br>
I was facing the other way.All of a sudden I hear one of the cups moving.And than I heard it move again.After some time passed.Again I hear it.I was pretty scared at this moment.But I never turned around.I kept on telling myself that It was nothing.And than I felt something coming over my
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///backside.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 backside.It
</a>
felt like this heavy air.All the hairs on my body were standing on end.
<br>
<br>
I kept telling myself that it was probably a draft that had moved the cups.And I was just imagining things..I grabbed onto my girlfriend..lol.It took me awhile but Eventually I fell asleep.When I woke up in the morning I came on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///here.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 here.It
</a>
was really early around 8 I think.And I started hearing footsteps up stairs.And you know I thought about my obe.I got even more scared.And than it sounded like someone was running around upstairs.
<br>
<br>
When they got right above me on my
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///comp.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
was like they jumped up and down twice.BOOM!,BOOM!I got up and checked to see if the people upstairs were

</a>
right now I was freaking out.And I think I went back to bed..lol...When my girlfriend woke up,I told her what happened.I was ready to go through some drastic measures to get rid of these ghosts...
<br>
<br>
But I came on here lator that day and explained what happened.Not in this much detail.And someone told me that negs were all in my head.And Im very grateful.Because I stopped being afraid.And after 3 or 4
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///days.my" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 days.My
</a>
fear was gone...
<br>
<br>
See how I added everything up.And my fear grew and grew.I think I actually provided the fuel(fear)for all this to occur.Nothing like this has happened to me again.
<br>
<br>
hahah so much for short.I just reread this part  to make sure it made sense.And saw how long I made it..

sounds like you have nothing to worry about!Your lucky to have someone watching over you.....:)and probably we all do...I almost got run over by a big bus when I was younger.Someone pulled me off the street.I never saw who did it.I dont think it was a ghost.For there was alot of other people walking on the sidewalk.If it wasnt for that person I probably wouldnt be here...

alpha Hi &amp; thanks for sharing your experiences with me. We have things in common! I have had things similar happen to me.
<br>
<br>
Many times I often hear things like a door squeak shut faintly or my kitchen trash can lid flap shut ... sometimes 5 times a day. Thumping all sorts of things. A few days after my mom passed I heard her voice arguing in my living room with a male voice and I think she was telling that neg off for me. ;o)
<br>
<br>
When she passed I did not know it at the time and I was woken up with the sound of her voice saying Hey Rob. This is what she called me. I come to find out she passed that day. I clearly heard Hi Robin one day when I was in my children's doctors office and I looked around and no one else heard it.
<br>
<br>
But what was interesting was I have heard and worked with a male figure in OBEs with the same voice . He is always warm and helpful.
<br>
<br>
When you were pushed out of danger it had to be your angel. Here is a site that people post there interesting encounters like yours .

I feel very protected and very loved and I feel when I do have nags around me it is a test of sorts. I don't want to get religious on

she was hanging a plant over what looked like a kitchen counter.She had a little white hat on over her

was covered up I think.
<br>

Ive never had any others like this yet but I hope I see her again.I looked at some of the pictures on your other page of mary.Her face looked like the lady I saw.But none of the clothes match.

Its a great page though.I like all the pictures you put on it.And I just read some of your visions, you sure made it pretty easy to read...lol...

Hi, New here. Usually post in newsgroup alt.out_of_body.  Interested in hearing others views. Fear is m biggest problem with OOBE's. I have always gotten my truest feeling OOBE's spontaniously since a teen from what I remember. Mine always start with a head buzzing, swirling sensation along with the sleep paralysis. Then my body "vibrates" (for lack of a better word) These "vibrations" feel severe though. Seizure-like. During all of this I am very very afraid and sense "evil". i have tried to just go with it before but the buzz and swirl got very loud and worse feeling. It takes a lot to finally get out of this state and sometimes happens over and over again in one night unless I get up and walk around a while to shake it off, so to speak.
<br>
Anyway, I was wondering what your theories and ideas are on this. I have been told repeatedly to realize that the fear is not valid and to just go with it and I will see all will be ok but this is really something I have treid but been unable to get past.
<br>
Thanks  for listening. All ideas welcome.

I had this insane dream this morning, and it brought about this fear that I thought I lacked x_x... Anyways, I have my ice skates on, and I'm at an ice-skate park; with ramps, half-pipes, etc.  Well, I step up to the opening drop (the park was like a rollercoaster, it had a path to follow, and it opened up with a devastating vertical drop, like a half pipe/vert ramp has).
<br>
<br>
I jumped onto it...but i didn't even catch the ramp... I was just free-falling (it was 50 feet or so high; obviously more of a rollercoaster drop than a ramp).  I fell...but the dream did not end there.  I got up and continued along the course...so n and so forth...jump, yadda yadda...then at the end, a girl that, in the dream, had intimate relations with me (that's how it felt to me) made out with another man in front of me...and that was like it for me.  I just rolled over and thought over it...  feels good to get it out there!

It had to do with heights and tight spaces.I guess I am afraid of that.I dont know I go on all kinds of coasters.And ive jumped off bridges and cliffs.Into water of course.hEH.I dont let that fear stop me.Its more like I use it to push myself.I was in some kind of amusement park.There was a huge water slide about 500 foot high.And it was incredible that this thing was standing.There werent any supports.

Just the ladder and the slide.I saw someone going down it that I know.When I went up to try it.I got close and I was looking up.And it started twisting and everything collapsed.I wasnt really wanting to climb up it anyway

<br>
So they built a new
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///ride.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 ride.In
</a>
just a moment.And it was a huge tunnel like flume ride.And it led to a restaurant.I think this must be another fear also.Restaurants I am never comfortable
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///in.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 in.So
</a>
thats 3 fears wrapped up in one dream.

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;When I got back in it to get out.The tunnel kept on getting smaller and smaller.Till I could barely move or breath.Thats when I woke up.
<br>
<br>
So far I have learned that fears take a while to get
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///over.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 over.As
</a>
long as you are moving in the right direction.They will go

 away.It
</a>
could take days,weeks,and months.I know I have some more coming.And I am ready.
<br>
<br>
Something that scared the chit out of me the other day.When I woke up I look over and see someone standing by the door next to my bed.Everything was blurry and I thought it was some kind of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///ghost.my" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 ghost.My
</a>
heart jumped out of my chest.Than everything started to get

</a>
was actually my own girlfriend. It took a while to calm myself down after that..lol

LOL its so funny to read about the incongruities in others' dreams, cuz I know exactly what they are like... I have had some horrible dreams... just disgusting nightmarish type, but nothing tormented me, it was the opposite.  I won't explain the horridness of one, unless you people think you could handle it.
<br>
<br>
But I had 4 dreams this morning.  I remember 3 of them clearly.  All hold a different fear (these dreams for the past week have all been nightmares) and I will tell you of one:
<br>
<br>
Okay, I am in a Star Trek episode, and I am playing the role of Spock (for a logical reason I won't get into).  We are on some machine in a blue sky.  Clouds are abundant around me, and vision in this immediate vicinity is clear.  I am following Capt. Kirk, and he is jumping around these metal tiles... When I make a jump, I dont land properly, and I am hanging on for my life.  I manage to pull myself off, and the ledge (?) snaps.  I grab onto another.... but right here I can't remember if I pulled myself up or not... If it was my guess, [redacted 3/4/15]
<br>
<br>
The others I prefer not to discuss...
<br>
<br>
If you think you can handle a graphic dream, let me know!  I kinda want to tell it...

I've had similar dreams. I'm either riding or srunning down a hill with increasing speed and longer and longer jumps until I come to a ravine and almost fall in except that somehow I manage barely to reach the other side.
<br>
Another one is where I'm standing on a high ridge or a mountain top and the ground around begins to collapse leaving me on a sliver of ground that's 'getting smaller and smaller.

This is a GREAT thread !!! . . . but I was wondering . . . does it belong in the OBE section?  certainly I'm not the forum moderator BUT . . . I was thinking this would be a great Astral Chat topic.  Just my two cents . . .

So far this is the only fear I can report!
<br>
I used the "don't expect anything" method and it did get me farther, but fear stopped me.
<br>
Last night was the first time I had gotten as far as I did and that was almost out and right back in, Darn it!!!
<br>
I started to spin wildly kinda like on an amusement park ride, while it was fun it scared me enough to send me right back!
<br>
Anyone have any tips on how to control or stop this?

</a>
me its  proof that we are really all one.We are constantly getting that same message to not be afraid.
<br>
<br>
Im not sure about the rest of the people here.Maybe they could comment on if they want to hear the scarier ones or not?Im pretty sure I can handle it.I have one myself that id like to share.I was plagued by really bad nightmares in my past.Thats why I think It easier for me to handle these kind of dreams.These are like a hot fudge sundae.Compared to my old

Hi tisha,I dont know but I always get these scare dreams inbetween my obes.I think I have to get over all these fears before I can go any higher.Everytime I feel im over them.I end up some place

<br>
<br>
<br>
And I feel alot of new people that join wind up here first.This stuff is very important especially in the beginning and beyond.
<br>
If anybody else wants it moved to the astral chat forum.Just say so here.The mod. will eventually see it.I personally do not really care where it

Heres a tip to speed things along.Getting over your fears.I dont know if I mentioned on this thread already.I may have.I know I repeat myself alot.

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;This works for me.
<br>
<br>
When you feel that 1st twinge of fear.Just stop remind yourself.That there is no reason to be
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///afraid.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 afraid.You
</a>
have to tell yourself in a very compassionate way.And say something that works for
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///you.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 you.You
</a>
can say as many times as you have too.And it doesnt have to be the same
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///thing.be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 thing.Be
</a>
patient,Fears do not just vanish.Listen to your dreams also.They show you what your fears
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///are.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 are.As
</a>
you can see by these examples.
<br>
<br>
They are always pretty obvious.
<br>
<br>
When you tell yourself,its not spoken words.Your thoughts im talking about here.
<br>
<br>
You cant be harsh with

can actually make things worst.

Haven't read all the posts, but fear of the unknown.
<br>
<br>
I can handle the things in my head, the "horror" movies, etc..
<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's strange though... sometimes I get in this mood where I am easily scared senseless (like watching X files...). I hate that... It's just really goddam annoying. Those are the only times I find it really hard to control my thoughts.

I'm scared of mirrors and dead people hahaha.
<br>
I don't even mind weird little astral creatures..but if dead people started talking to me and stuff...that would scare the crap out of me...especially if i could see them...Im glad Ive really only seen two people during my astral experiences..and one didnt even seem human even though he appeared so (it was that whole man in black thing from the forums a couple months back

I've had sort of visions of this guy dressed in a black monk type cpae holding a staff. But I've gotten a friendly vibe from him...
<br>
Probably tomorrow I'll come screaming back to this thread scared ****less
<br>
<br>
My childhood was full of nightmares. One particular that really upset me was just a dream where I saw chaotic colours and there was a terrible screeching sound all aroung me. Yup, exit effects probably.
<br>
Another one was about a tiny little white flower being crushed by huge car tires. And for some reason I was there and it felt that if the flower got crushed things would really go bad. Also with this dream there was a sensations you get when you squeeze something small,hard and sharp in your palm.
<br>
Scary when I was 5-10 but not anymore.

Have this dream I remember vaguely.I was in my old room.And I was telling someone I was seeing demons.And I was very scared in it.Could this have been to prepare me for what im doing now?
<br>
<br>
When I got up I told myself.If I was ever in a position where I could see those things.That I would not go that way.But here I am.Ive seen my own negs attacking me as well as felt them draining me.And other unbelievable things.And I am not really afraid.But this dream I wonder about sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Opinions?
