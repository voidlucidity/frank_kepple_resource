Ha ha ha, computers, who'd have 'em, lol. What a flaming problem those darned machines have given me of late. Simply cannot believe the computer hassle I've had the past few weeks!!! Anyhow, here I am and it's gone 3am in my time zone so I'm off within myself soon. Will be back with a bang proper next week.
<br>
<br>
Apologies to anyone who has been expecting a reply to a post or an email as I just haven't been able to get online. It's great to be back though.

Frank,
<br>
I have a spare computer that I would gladly give to you.  It may not be a fancy smancy brand new computer, but it can get on the internet and load a word processor and e-mail program.  I believe it is a Pentium 3 running somewhere between 350 - 450 Mhz.

I've been trying to track down why I seem to be stuck at the moment. From what I can gather from one of Franks post there seems to be some protection mechanism I need to address. Perhaps it's a case of needing to review how I've been approaching the whole subject.

Its a sad story about Frank I really liked his humour.
<br>
I dont know exactly what happen, but here is my view.
<br>
I was online in the forum when Frank last acted as moderator late night (about 2 GMT), where he had a rather amusing/disturbing feud with someone who did not agree with him. All those threads where deleted next day and Frank went off the forum.
<br>
Knowing the stern and serious character of Adrian, I am quite sure he sacked him, never really admiting what he did and
<b>
 creating a myth
</b>
this way.
<br>
I never went much to visit this forum afterwards, for spirituality without humour is a dry thing, and Frank was the humourous soul of this forum. Besides, nothing compairs to a living master, you can meet as a Person.

<br>
That doesn't sound like Adrian to me. Of all the fights between moderators and members in the past, Adrian has never taken action like that - he hires, not fires. All other mods have left on their own, even when things hit the fan. Don't you think Frank would show up somewhere else and say what was up, or take his teachings elsewhere? He didn't seem like he would just abandon all of it over one late night argument. He seemed determined and spoke about health problems well ahead of his disappearance.

Put aside the question, who did what, Franks disapearance from this forum was never properly communicated.
<br>
And you were too "young" then to remember and tell us what went wrong. And reading his last comments as moderator, that "health issue" does sound like a "political" retirement to me.

I know that this is probably a complete coincidence, but my uncle was named Frank and he died from cancer around the time the Frank here stopped posting. My uncle was always very down to earth, very spiritual, and one with nature. He also had the greatest sense of humor I've ever seen in anyone. These are all things I've seen in your Frank here. Probably a coincidence, maybe not. Who knows?

I can gaurentee that Frank was not booted by any forum authorities!! We were all quite worried about him at the time, so much so that we tried to hunt down his real life address and I personally sent an (amusing) postcard to our best guess asking "hey whats up?!" - but never got a reply. Reasons for his dissapearance were never communicated simply because nobody had any idea what they were, trust me on this. Any yes, it was a shame, he was an good guy.

That is awfully strange... I'm always curious when people disappear.

This would be one of the problems with anonymity on the internet.
<br>
When someone does disappear, we have no idea what happened... as far as we know Frank could have been abducted by aliens... or died...
<br>
<br>
Hopefully, he's safe and alive and NOT with aliens.

Unless they're sex aliens like in Star Trek... &gt;_&gt;  LoL

The last days hi spoke with Frank by PM, we were trading ebooks if i can remember well. I gave him some few ebooks and as a way of saying thanks, he said he would offer me a copy/ebook of his book (the release was near i think). After that i never had any more news about him.
<br>
<br>
I remember some discussions here in the forum about some people complaining that they bought that book before receiving it, and in the end they never saw the book, neither the money they gave. Some people start talking that Frank may have disapeared with the money. In my mind i still believe that Frank didnt do that, that something different happened. But we must accept that something really happened to him. Maybe a) He is dead...thats a very probable thing  b) He really escape with the money of the books he sold, but i dont want to believe on that  c) he, or someone in his family, is very ill and he lost all the emotional or physical capability to be on a computer  d) someone he loved died, and that "kills" a people for sure.
<br>
<br>
Its a shame that we dont have even his email so we could trace him (by visiting facebook, hi5, etc) or contact his family so we could know if he his ok. I will pray for him. He was, so far i remember, a very nice guy.

I believe that Frank went up to the 4th density level some time ago.
<br>
<br>
After reading some of Frank's work though I would probably say he's in the 5th or 6th density by now!
