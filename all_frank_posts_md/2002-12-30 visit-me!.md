<section>
I have had another idea relating to meeting etc. How about any one of you who are on this forum try and visit me1 I invite anyone who reads this forum to try and project to my bedroom and then come onto the forum and describe it to me. Winner gets a nice shiney apple. Try to imagine me and say to yourself "I am going to visit Lysears house in England!" or something similar.
<br>
<br>
Anyone got any thoughts on this then feel free to reply. Also whoever reads this I emplore you to try it, have a go at trying to reach me tonight.

hey Lysear,
<br>
where do you live? cause i live in UK too i may be able to travel to ur house and not create an astral double of it. i have not managed to actually get away from my body yet, though i have had 2 OBE experiences, one last night, i have problem detaching the last parts of my body... mostly the heart and head. anyways i feel im getting closer and success i feel is in grasp. so if i actually know where you live i could travel to you, and if u can u can try flag me down once i get close.
<br>
<br>
just an idea

Do you have something in your room like a cloth sofa or chair, perhaps light to medium brown in colour? It may sound daft but your post crossed my mind this morning and that's the best impression I could get, for now.

I attempted to have a little wonder around as well Lysear.
<br>
I seem to remember a rug like texture... it was like that thick, fake hair you get on dolls - sort of a blonde colour, maybe really light brown.
<br>
<br>
I aslo remember something prowling about (nothing scary mind) like a cat or a small dog.  Oh, and a lamp shade (taller that wide) with a cross in the centre (proably to hold the bulb).
<br>
<br>
... not sure if the lamp-shade impression was linked to the other two in retrospect.
<br>
I'll have another go in a few nights time (got a stinker of a cold at the mo so will just be sleeping).

I tried again just for a minute or so this morning and I got a very strong impression of a blue coloured area. Something like a wall or a duvet cover, or maybe the carpet, and that's all.

I'm usually home between 6 pm and 6 am eastern time and would love the company.  I promise I won't freak out, I'm used to "visitors"

Once I can get some *control* over my experiences, I'll definitely stop by and visit you two!  Until then, I'll keep practicing more and more!

Cheers!
