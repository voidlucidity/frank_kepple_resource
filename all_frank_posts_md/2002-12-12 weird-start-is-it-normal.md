Hello biba.
<br>
Congrats!  I'm no authority on OBEs and am very new to this site. My first ever OBE was unexpected as I hadn't ever considered attempting it before.  I dozed off in the daytime and came out of my body into the living room.  Everything was black and white (like watching black n white tv on a snowy channel, but much more 3D).  I wasn't sure what was happening and tried to move.  It was very, very hard going - my responses were sluggish - i think because i was trying to move in physical terms.  After I had crossed a bit of the room I turned round and saw myself.  And "plop" that's when I returned to the physical.  If you were putting a lot of mental effort into exiting then the momentum (along with the excitement) probably shot you up like a rocket.
<br>
<br>
What I used to do in the beginning (especially when experimenting with remote viewing) was to issue movement commands.  So if I saw an object up close I might have tried:
<br>
pull back slow
<br>
stop
<br>
rotate right
<br>
stop
<br>
arc up
<br>
etc.
<br>
<br>
If this had happened to me next time I would probably will myself to slow down and try and keep Very Calm.  Oh, and just say to yourself that you have complete control.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, as i said, I am very new to specific techniques and I'm sure others will help further.  Hope this was useful.

I didn't realise until now that it was written by Robert Bruce so its probably been expanded upon on this site someplace.

Terrance: yes, the moving real slow like monitoring every step is darned good advice. Try and slow to a standstill and remain mentally calm... and then move on from there... which is what I always say.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, when we project to the Astral the first few times, we tend to move as if we are resisting the same kind of forces that we are moving whilst Physical. Forces such as gravity, for example.
<br>
<br>
Like, when I very first started to project into the real time zone, I'd get this flash of a vision of my bedroom then everything would become a blur... why? Because I discovered I was flying out of there at a zillion MPH.
<br>
<br>
Likewise when projecting to the Astral the first times. Everything would be a blur... until I realised that I was zipping here and there at lightning speed without realising it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hey biba. What you said about the moving trough ceilings, I've experiensed the exact same thing on one of my first OBE's. I also had trouble gaining control but I managed to stop it. I think I ended up on the floor somewhere in my bedroom (not physicly), but the clarity of the vision was very low. I was probably just low on "energy" since I had an OBE only about half an hour before that one. It isnt always easy to have control over OBE's but I think you just have to stay focused and consentrated that usually works. Sometimes I just "go with the flow", wich is totaly contrary to my real life principles, but when it comes to OBE's thats ok

<br>
<br>
The last OBE's I had, my astral body had a tendancy to uncontrolably shot trough the ceiling or the sky (if I was outside) and then plunge right into the earth, after I had called it the quit. I think that was kinda fun actually since its not my physical body...

I'm starting to notice that a substantial amount of ppl report shooting through ceilings as they get out. But usually it doesn't add up with the amount of ceilings there is in that current house the person who is experiencing it, is in. I don't think your actually shooting through ceilings at that phase.... you are "tuning". By that I think, we are adjusting the frequency of what phase in all the realms we get to tune into.  I've had it too, many times... It "feels" like moving "up" or "down" but at that phase of an OBE I think it is your awareness/energy shifting trough frequencies and adjusting itself to its suitable level according to whatever state your in, maybe. I sure as hell don't know, but thats what it seems to me. And might be an explanation to why it doesn't add up.

Good find, it's good to see the topics that Frank replied to. He was active before I started reading the AP site.
<br>
<br>
Lol, it adds up to me. I only have one ceiling in the house, and if, on rare occasion, when I float up I only go through one ceiling. Another time while flying around a neighborhood, I entered an attic from the side of a house. It required trust because I didn't know what was in the attic until passing through the wall.
<br>
<br>
The other part you mention about shooting up, are you talking about something like getting a shock as if blasting up the spine and up through the top of the head into a void, and then phasing into imagery, AP, or OBE?
<br>
<br>
If so, the feeling for me is maybe several "ceilings", or transitions. OBE seems to involve more stimulus and mechanics, where phasing seems to be very uncomplicated with "tuning", as you said, into a 3D immersion to an AP that starts with hynogogic imagery.

I'll try to explain what I meant further....  I recently had an OBE, and its been about a year since last time. I was sleeping in the first floor of a 3 storie house. The fact that its been so long since last time, I think made me more objective to the whole ordeal... it was in the morning. I woke up by the characteristic feeling that I was gonna project.... So I even thought "ok... its this again...  go, or no go?" I had the usual choice of an immediate wake-up and move, or just relax and let it rip....   I felt comfortable enough to let it rip. So it happened. And I got kinda supriced at the energy I was projecting at... coz I felt like I was shot out like a cannonball.... but relaxed as I was, since this has happened before I was able to not be awed by the thing and keep my cool, so to speak, and just observe what I really was seeing, instead of expecting this and that, or be amazed or afraid. I just observed to see what I saw.
<br>
<br>
What I could see was ofc the usuall gray "neverland" that happens in the first phase and then like only after 1 sec I could see the room I was in and shooting trough the ceiling but as I got trough the ceiling I just got back to the same room I was in.... over and over again....  As observing this objectively consequently trying to eliminate all feelings what so ever. This is what I really saw. And finally as I seatled in the room I moved up but I got bounced down into the floor of the room next to mine and really into the floor... and it all got dark. I just called it off, by then. I think it relatively speaking lasted about 10-15sec... But I clearly remember the experience and also I remember thinking as I hit the floor that I should get back so I could remember this. So all in all, a successful OBE, in that respect.
<br>
<br>
To the point: It looked like the realm was out of phase to my observing "eye" like a video tape flickering slowly coz its close to the same Hz but not quite... if u know what I mean.
<br>
<br>
Thats what it looked like to me.
