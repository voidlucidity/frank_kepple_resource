i'm  not that experienced w/ prjections yet but i'm going to reply to this because nobody else has yet.
<br>
<br>
the swirling feeling you speak of i recall gettinga few times after immediately laying down. i dont think you need to do anything else but lay down. i'm sure there are other conditions which would help get there faster and which may have been present at the times in which we both got there faster than we should have.
<br>
<br>
this could be totally off but i'll offer it anyway. i think you mentioned that you didnt actually project, maybe you didnt actually project but were using remote viewing. there have been other cases where people have projected or thought they had and found that they were in the rtz but w/ subtle changes in it. try doing a search for somethng like this and see what comes up.
<br>
<br>
your last question i dont think needs any technical talk. if you want to increase your projections, practice practice practice. the more you do this the more second nature it's going to be.
<br>
<br>
i've read some on doing retrieval work and the such. i m under the impression that it's not something that we all go through as part of a learning proecess but rather something that we choose to do. as for doing it while we are asleep .. i cant say we do or dont, however, i feel like this is something that we consciously choose to do and couldnt see as how maybe we would stumble upon it.  i've seen Frank give an array of answers on this subject. if he doesnt get a chance to respond to this, maybe pm him and give him a heads up to this topic.
<br>
<br>
i hope you get the rest of your questions answered, good luck projecting.

You appear to be making good progress. What I would do is not go into too much detail at the moment. Problem is, each projection always causes more questions than it answers, and that will be the same all down the line.
<br>
<br>
The key thing to do is ask the questions
<i>
 at the time
</i>
. Which means becoming open to those who are guiding you as quick as you can. Obviously I cannot say for sure but the man in the truck may have been a guide watching over you.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is practice as often as possible, and teach yourself to remain emotionally closed: just keep an air of mild curiosity. You noticed that, at first, everything seems in a complete rush. This is because we tend to use the same degree of impulsion on the Astral as we do on the Physical. But it takes only a tiny fraction of the effort to do things on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
So the first thing I always suggest newcomers to do is, once they project, try and remain as still as possible. Then, from that point of stillness, start taking tiny steps.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
