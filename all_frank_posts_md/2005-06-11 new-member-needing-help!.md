<section>
Hey guys, I've got a few questions about a few things. First off, let me introduce myself since I'm new here. My magical name is Fynix. I am a 16 year old girl that is finally able to really get serious about becoming a wiccan. I've read so much on oh so many subjects and am passionate about it all. I have experienced strange things, including.
<br>
<br>
A few months ago when I was wondering if I was a fool to believe in magic and the supernatural (it wasn't helping that everyone around me kept repeating to me that I was a fool and should stop believing). Of course for me to question myself on this was extremely painful because I have believe in this my whole life, so I did a ritual to ask for help. About a week later, while babysitting, I was watching my favorite show when all of a sudden, it disappeared right in the middle of the best part (the tv got all blurry as it sometimes does when you don't have that particular channel). In panic, I swish my hand saying in a very sure and pretty loud voice: "TV ON!" It clicks back on without sound, so I scream yet again: "SOUND ON!" as if by reflex, and this time making a turning motion with my hand and the volume bar goes right up! I was stunned! I kept looking from the tv to my hand. When I tried again, nothing happened! Then once again, about a week later, I was in my bathroom when all of a sudden the lights click off. I stayed sitting on the toilette watching the crack in the door and then I saw a shadow of a man pass across it! (it was too clear to be an illusion and by the way I saw it, he was inside the room with me!) I screamed, threw myself at the light, clicked it on!!! (in other words it had been turned off) and ran out!! (nobody else had been in the house with me that day). I have also had three times controlled a street lamp (twice when angry it went out, once when very happy, it turned on; same street lamp for all 3 times).  I do wish to understand what theses events mean. Am I using PK?? If so, how can I control it better (enhance the ability)

<br>
<br>
Also, I'm trying to find more information about OBEs and how to astral project. I have read a LOT about this for the past few weeks and a little bit every once in a while before. I deeply want to do this but feel as though I have tried everything and failed... I know I'm young, but I so want to astral project. I'm ready and patiente enough to do exercises before actually astral projecting, but I don't know what I should start doing. Please help me out. Is there a book I should read, a technique I should perfect, something I should learn to do regularly???
<br>
<br>
Thank you SOOOO much if you take the time to help me.
<br>
Fynix

Hello, Wolfynix and welcome to the forums.
<br>
<br>
All of these things can be very frightening to someone when they're first coming at cha, and even more so for a teenager.
<br>
<br>
It sounds like your experiences you've had as of late verify your belief in their existence. If you want to believe in it, then you should. I understand how confusing it can be at first, especially when a lot of people around you don't believe in it.
<br>
<br>
I, too have experienced the phenomena of lights flickering on or off as I pass under them. It usually happens when I'm under a certain degree of stress, or when deep in thought. I've also noticed that I don't have a lot of control over it, and  I can't make it happen at will.
<br>
<br>
It's not just streetlamps...it can be lights in a parking garage, lights in a room, even electronic devices...I think the funniest incident of all was in a job interview I had about a month ago: When the lady asked me the toughest question of all (and the one that had been giving me the most stress lately): "what makes you stand out so that we should hire YOU?", the light directly overhead turned on (to which the lady joked "it's a sign!).

Here's a good website with a lot of info:

As far as the wicca end of things, I have no experience in that. All I can say is to keep believing in what you believe in, as long as it doesn't interfere with the rest of your life (school work, relationships, etc.) If it does get to that point, then you'll know when to cut back and focus on other things temporarily.

We do have a Magic section which you can check out:

P.S. Be sure to check out the astral FAQ for suggestions on how to project, especially the post I just added on entering the astral from a dream:

If you're not in control of it then maybe it's some kind of poltergeist thingie going on?

Well I dunno, for the tv thing, it was in a house where I was babysitting often, and I really wanted it to work! As I said, it felt like a reflex. For the thing where I saw... something! well that I dunno. and for the streetlight thingies, the times where I was angry, I didn't control the light, it would just... I dunno, turn off, shut down, go out all of a sudden. For the time where it went on, while it had been the only one out (it had become brighter than all the other street lamps). That time I wanted it to come on. It was to my surprise though that it actually had worked.
<br>
<br>
You guys tell me, am I using PK?? or if it is a poltergeist/spirit/ghost, how can I know or contact him or have a talk with him/her??? (That would be really cool to me ^^) While I'm asking this, are homemade widja boards dangerous??? (just wondering, cause I've heard of lotsa widja stories where the people having used the widja vowed to never even touch on again).
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Fynix
