I don't know if I can't remember them, or if I just draw a blank all night. I rarely ever remember a dream(if I had a dream). Is there a way to help remember, or dream? I just draw a blank for weeks on end. I'll have one now and then, but usually the night is a blank.
<br>
<br>
Any Thoughts?

I take 100mg. of vitamin B6 daily, usually at bedtime. This enables me to remember on average 10 to 12 dreams nightly.

Try thinking about dreams more throughout the day, and try to stop thinking like "Im not having dreams" or "I wont have a dream" because then it might just stay true.

YOu
<i>
 should
</i>
be able to train yourself to remember them. Do you keep a journal? Its improtant at least in the beginning. Also don't get out of bed immediately. Sit there and try to remember as soon as you wake up as a priority. Once you've ran them through your head a few times, then write them down.

All right, I'll give these ideas a try. Just got out of bed. Can't remember what I dreamed. It was a complete blank.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Many people live their physical lives in a very narrow field of mental focus. This closes down their access to subjective information such as dreams. To widen your focus, what I would suggest you try are some of the basic energy-work excercises that Bob Bruce talks about. Plus, incorporate some kind of creative visualisation work; though the energy-work excercises do incorporate an element of this, but can be expanded upon once you start getting into it more.
<br>
<br>
Basically, it's no use keep banging your head against the same brick wall. If you are not making progress in one direction then simply try another.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Actually I did have a dream last night. I just remembered it later. Can't remember it all, but I remember I was looking into a mirror at one part of it.

It's widely believed that vitamin supplements don't do you much good btw.  Best to get vitamins from real food.  In some cases taking too much vitamins can actually cause damage.  I know that one in particular can dramatically increase the chance of females developing osteoporosis in later life, though I'm not sure exactly which.

Just though you'd like to know

Hey, I've been working on this, and I'm starting to remember dreams. Not long bits of the dream, but it seems to be improving I've even wrote down some dreams. Thanks Everyone. Going to keep at it.
