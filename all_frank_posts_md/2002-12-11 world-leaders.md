How is that men with such a low spiritual level have been getting into power in various countries for thousands of years? Not only are these corrupt men  getting the power to control a country, but other corrupt men have been and still are getting into power in various churches.
<br>
If men and women who had the spiritual level of Jesus Christ or even a higher spiritual level were the ones leading these countries today, then a lot of chaos, which is currently happening would not be happening in this world.
<br>
Instead we have men in power in various countries who are like a bunch of kids fighting over toys in a sandbox.

This reminds me of Douglas Adams' take on the whole leadership thing  - people who have the skills to be a good president generally don't have the personality needed to run for this position, whereas those who have the personality should in no way be trusted with the job.
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that world leaders have gotten to their positions because of their abilities to deal with their country's political processes. These processes by their very nature tend towards corruption. Politics is all the same in this respect, be it national politics or church politics.

a refreshing way to look at it is that all these people with low spiritual levels    whom r in power ,r in power only in the physical way, they have no power over peoples hearts like profets and good people do and thats where it realy counts and where it is REALY power.

I simply look at it like this.  Most often a the person most suited for a position of leader ship is one who does not want it.  They are the ones who usually have the common good in mind.  They don't think that it would be good for "them" as a person, or for money.  They look at the position with humility thinking that they are not worthy of the task.
<br>
<br>
A person in general seeks positions, status, and so on to improve thier life.  They for the most part seek the admiration of friends and loved ones.
<br>
A person who has taken thier search inside usually ends up looking for love, balance, and happiness.  They seek not the admiration but rather the love from friends and family.  In the end it is not who you are but what you are that will detirmine your happiness.

I read an interesting story in a newsletter the other day.
<br>
<br>
Out of a group of 535 people, 7 had been arrested for fraud; 19 for writing duff cheques; 71 have such lousy credit they can't even get a credit card; 8 were handcuffed for shoplifting; 84 ended up in jail for drink-driving; 29 were arrested for beating their wives; 3 have done jail time for assault; 14 have been incarcerated on drug-related charges; and 117 have previously owned business which they put into bankruptcy.
<br>
<br>
Apparently, these are the people who currently make up the United States Congress. The writer claimed they were real numbers. Real or not, it did make me chuckle.

Well, in Italy the situation isn't better....
<br>
<br>
I agree with  cainam_nazier, I would add that if a good person
<br>
would try to became a leader he would probably be eliminated
<br>
in one way or another (I didn't mean in a physical way, but perhaps...).
<br>
Corrupts who have power would clearly see the danger of
<br>
losing their power, it happened 2000 years ago, it would be
<br>
easy today too.
<br>
Perhaps I'm a bit pessimistic or paranoic, but perhaps I'm
<br>
only realistic. However I'm not losing hope
