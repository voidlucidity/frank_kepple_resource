Hey all,
<br>
<br>
The past three weeks has been certainly interesting for me in terms of Phasing.
<br>
<br>
Because i am basically new to all of this, a blank canvas you could say. I thought i start off by observing myself as i fall asleep each night. Here are some of the things i have noticed.
<br>
<br>
1) Better dream recall. It's seems intent alone for me increase my ability to recall. Hopefully in time i will be able to recount my dreams with increasing accuracy, but for now it's a good start.
<br>
<br>
2) When i close my eyes to sleep, the first thing i notice is shapes, floating past the blackness of my vision, then slowly colours come into play. While watching these colours i have successfully on most attempts, changed the colours of these shapes
<br>
<br>
3) After sometime, my mind begins to wonder away probably towards dreamland, but as soon as i realize my mind is wondering i bring my focus right back. Soon enough images, faint and random begin to appear and disappear. The images are totally random and not sparked of by any thoughts, I'm simply noticing what is appearing before me.
<br>
<br>
4) EYES! Whilst  the random imagery is fading in and out of my... inner view, eyes will start to appear. Eyes from different faces. I'll maybe see part of there noise too. The colours are not Sharpe. The skin tone seems dull. I don't recognize any of the eyes. But they appear, maybe blink and disappear.
<br>
<br>
It is at this point and beyond i cannot remember. My attention drifts away into sleep.
<br>
<br>
Through these experiences i have noted down a few questions i thought i would put to the board.
<br>
<br>
1) Once in the relaxed state of noticing, whereby i see the imagery. Do i actively need to tell myself i want to focus onto another level? Or is this something that will occur naturally the longer i hold my attention.
<br>
<br>
2) Although i have obtained better dream recall, i still cannot seem to become conscious in a dream. Is this again something that will develop naturally with time?
<br>
<br>
3) Are the images of eyes I'm seeing, anything to do with a different focus level or anything of the like, or are they simply brain farts.
<br>
<br>
I have others questions first, but i wish to experiment a little further.. Kinda find my own feet.
<br>
<br>
Any help from the Astral Pulse Alumni would greatly appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>

I don't have an answer to this, but your not alone.  I see faces alot when I am trying to phase.  I don't get any colors or shapes, but out of nowhere I will see people looking at me or see some outdoors scene that as soon as I notice it it goes away because I move my eyes.  The people I see tend to be in a pose for a painting, I can see them from the waist up and they are looking right at me, usually wide eyed.  Recently I have been going through a period of advances in my over all practice and can maintain a reverse image of them in the back on my eyelids after they disappear, like I have been staring at them for a while.  This can be rather disconcerting sometimes due to the frightening nature of some of the peoples looks and expressions, but is very interesting because I have never seen any of these people or have any reason to see them.  Most of them appear to be from Elizabethan era or the Renaissance.

To obtain even better dream recall start a dream notebook.  I am going to get back into this myself, because it has a profound effect on remembering dreams and creating lucid dreams.  It became a bother to me because at first I could only remember 1 dream a night, however, pretty soon I had to write 5-9 dreams down everyday.  I am not sure it was because of intent or not but starting a dream journal will GREATLY increase the number of dreams you will remember during the night.  ALso, the dreams will become more vivid and after about a week and a half I had my first lucid dream (which is awesome the first time you have one),  When you are in trance keep telling yourself that you will wake up inside your dream.  This should help.

Hey all,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your responses, i appreciate and have learned from them all.

Being able to hold the images of these eyes hadn't even occurred to me. I just let them disappear. I think that is something i will attempt to try if i see them again in the future. As an educated guess most of the eyes i see are female. Although i distinctly remember seeing a pair of eyes that didn't fit the profile of any human. Humanoid no doubt, but the closest i can describe is 'Goblin' like. I wasn't at all afraid at any point during the experience, in fact i felt quite exhilarated at simply having the experience.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Frank&gt;

thanks in advance for taking the time out to write a response to my post. I look forward to your insight.

It's funny you should mention LaBerge. I ordered a book off amazon a few days back called 'Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming' It arrived on Saturday. I had no idea who the author was until i checked after your reply. I look forward to getting stuck in.
<br>
<br>
I will also try waking two hours early, although i think it will take me a little time because at the moment a brass band would have trouble waking me up early hahaa.
<br>
<br>
It is interesting that you and KnightLight see faces and i only eyes. Maybe as i develop i will be able to see more. This is something i will hope for.
<br>
<br>

I have read about other people starting dream notebooks and it is something i think i will start. At the moment i would say i remember at least two dreams a night. I know i have more in that time but the memories are to fragmented to even consider. Thanks for tip.
<br>
<br>
Thank you all. I hope to let you know of any progress i make in the near future.
<br>

Hello knighlight,
<br>
<br>
Quite an elaborate description of your personal hypnagog themes, I'd say, very interesting. I think I have no such theme except some rare guests like seeing digital displays or my alarm clocks in the darkness, or holes through I watch something in the distance, maybe windows, my face, the sun, the moon, stars. Anyway, why do you think that trying to keep negative afterimages is beneficial for your phasing practice? I ask this because I think quite the opposite.
<br>
<br>
If we talk about the same thing, of course, the negative pictures are likely just due to some remaining excitation in the visual cortex. They should be close to the phosophenes in nature: undulating light structures in the visual chaos we see behind our closed eyes. Are you agree?
<br>
<br>
For me, only very mature pictures could leave similar blobs after they disappeared. Their most brighter parts remain for seconds. Could be my lame version of your stable negative pictures. But I always thought these images as to be more useless than those that 9981 call "brain farts."
<br>
<br>
So I used to direct my attention away from them, directly to the feeling I've been having while I've been seeing them. Or at least beyond the entopic screen because when I see pictures I feel myself being centered rather in the middle of my head then at my eyes. I doubt we could ever describe this particular direction in words, but I'm sure it is far away from the body, and things like breathing, vibrations, buzzes, electric surges, noises, etc.
<br>
<br>
It should be beyond the entopic visions too where your negative pictures apparently belongs to. They are more related though, since concentrating on after images is proved to be an extremely good practice for phasing. But when a real picture, brain fart or not, just have disappeared, I could definitely think up better directions to look into.

Knightlight, this is freaky! The views of people you talk about is what I call my "portraits." I used to see them quite often, in fact, whenever I sat down to meditate. I've been goofing off on the meditation however, and haven't seen them as often just lately. I also see landscapes, sometimes with people, sometimes not. I saw a herd of horses once that was pretty impressive -- I was right in the middle of them and they didn't mind a bit.
<br>
<br>
The portraits I see seem to be in the Elizabethan (or Rennaissance) eras and are from the waist up. The detail is exquisite, every nuance is there, including facial features, clothes, etc. They have never reacted to my presence and just sit there. I'll see one person for a few seconds or so, then that one will fade away and another will appear. I've seen one old man who seems dressed in more modern clothes, maybe the 1940's or so, plus at least one Native American. I never try to hold them; I just let them appear and fade as they wish.
<br>
<br>
This could be pure coincidence, but I really wonder. You couldn't be more specific in describing what I see. Just wild!
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
<br>
<br>
9981, it sounds like you are doing just fine! The only advice I would give is to practice relaxing your physical eyes and just moving your perception up to your third eye. This is not easy, but it seems that whenever my physical eyes start to get involved, I lose whatever picture I was seeing.
<br>
<br>
"Brain farts"? Nope. That would be when your hand reaches for a glass and knocks the glass over instead. Everything we are trying to accomplish through meditation is mental. We are asking our brain to let us think in different ways. So yes, we are going to experience some unusual events. I'm not ready to try and put a label on what's happening yet. There's a guy named Stuart Wilde who says it's pretty common to see this type of thing, and recommends just staying passive and taking notice. I can't tell you what would be most effective, because I have been unable to OBE at will so far.
<br>
<br>
It sounds like you have a good system going, just keep on truckin' and see what develops!

Knightlight,
<br>
<br>
I thought I would add one more comment to my last post. Here is an excerpt from my dream log for May 19th:
<br>

 <br>
 I am still not seriously meditating, and have not seen my mental portraits for some time now. I do seem to routinely see scenes on that "behind the eyelids" screen before sleeping, or when I manage to find time to do a meditation. They are almost always interesting, full scenes, but no story behind them. I just see it, nothing explains it.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Does that sound similar to what you were talking about?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The Noticing exercise is deigned to help complete beginners start looking within themselves. No matter what you wish to do, it all takes place WITHIN you, not outside of you. Even an RTZ projection is taking place within you, not outside of you though I admit that is how it looks. But in an RTZ projection you have taken a step BACK, so to speak, from what I call the frontline physical. You have not in any way gone beyond the physical as many people think. This can cause a person to give themselves mixed messages in their attempts to somehow go outside of themselves when in fact they need to be going WITHIN themselves.
<br>
<br>
There are no "levels" in consciousness. I want to make clear that Focus 4 is not in any way "higher level" than focus 3. It is simply different. In the same way an apple is not a higher fruit than an orange, it is just a different fruit. What you are doing is shifting your focus to a different area in your consciousness continuum. The very act of looking within you is the act of shifting your focus to a different area. There is nothing in particular you need tell yourself though sometimes it helps to verbalise things for a while beforehand, get your mind settled on the task in hand and all that.
<br>
<br>
Becoming conscious in a dream to the extent where you can operate with all mental faculties fully engaged is a little tricky. That is why I take the approach of Focusing within F2 from a fully conscious state beforehand. The dream action is very similar to the action of finding yourself stepping into your mental rundown, but not quite the same. The latter keeps your mental faculties switched on throughout so you don't have the tricky problem of trying to "come awake" within the dream environment. Practice is what it takes to make good with this. In my opinion, it is actually easier to learn to switch focus from the Physical than it is to try to develop the skill of "coming awake" from within a dream.
<br>
<br>
The images you are seeing are probably just images of other aspects of yourself within Focus 2 of consciousness that you are offering to yourself for your amusement. When we do this, we tend to offer ourselves all manner of snippets of this and that. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to it all. These images I tend to look at like road signs that tell you that you are getting close to where you want to go. In the past I have tried to pin down these images in order to try to study them. But there is nothing really worth mentioning about them. They appear to be just fleeting packets of energy, random subjective noise that we interpret as all manner of nonsensical imagery.
<br>
<br>
I'm glad you are having fun in experimenting. That is exactly the right attitude. Simply lie back and have fun seeing what you offer yourself. I feel people tend to take this whole thing too seriously. I think that is because mystics have tended to overcomplicate everything and present this as something we each need to "qualify" for and be reverent towards, almost like worshipping. Not a bit, I go within myself to have FUN in the process of learning about the wider reality. It should be a fun exercise. The Phasing Approach takes on board no element of "spirituality" and recognises that each of us has the SAME subjective energy structure. So if you get someone preaching to you that to be successful you have to be of a particular "high level" of "development" then... laugh!
<br>
<br>
All that kind of stuff is mere spiritual snobbery from people who probably cannot get out of Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Knightlight, I can empathize with trying to slow down some of the images. I will mention hieroglyphics below, and I tried to will those to slow down -- no good, they just came as they wished.
<br>
<br>
Frank, I asked a question in another post that I really am curious about, so am taking the liberty of posting it here:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

 </cite>
 And let me ask one more, if I may. I was on a plane and decided to do a bit of meditation. I never went to sleep (impossible with all the noise). But after a few minutes I began to see images of Native American hieroglyphics. They came slowly at first, one at a time, then started speeding up and crowding together, then gradually trickled back down until they stopped. It was exactly like turning a water faucet slowly on to full force, then just as slowly back off. I am assuming we flew over what I call a "place of power," sort of an energy vortex. There's another one of these in Muir Woods (another story). Can you give me your impression of what that might be?
</blockquote>
<br>
First, do you believe there are energy vortexes or "places of power"? If so, are those generated by us -- internal, so to speak, or are they physical phenomena?
<br>
<br>
As to what Knightlight and I are seeing, the most interesting part is the similarity -- if they are random, the odds of us seeing the same type of portraits would be really small. Shinobi also seems to see similar images, so that's three, just so far. Wonder how many others see the same thing? Of course, this could just be that we are activating the same areas of our brain and thus would naturally expect similar images. Hmmmm...
<br>
<br>
Last night I was able to do a brief meditation. At first I was seeing Greco-Roman images, long lines of statues, then fuzzy head views from the same period. Then I saw a black area and was able to send my vision through it. There was another one beyond it, but looked sort of like a tunnel. I went into that for a time, and was looking at what could have been some kind of star field when Hubby came in wanting to turn on the TV. End of session.

You guys are giving me the boost I needed to get me back into regular meditation. Thanks!
