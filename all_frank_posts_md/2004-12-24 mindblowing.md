I want to know what we all think of what the psychic boy in our heads means.  I want to know what it is that connects him to everything, how its possible and who is he really.
<br>
<br>
What does everyone here think?  Please EVERYone share an opinion.

It's lousy netiquette to cross-post.
<br>
<br>
Especially when it's gibberish

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I think this current mystery tour should come to an end, and it's a cross-post in any event as someone has rightly pointed out.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
