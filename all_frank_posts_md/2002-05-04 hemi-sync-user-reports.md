<section>
As a result of discussions on one of the threads I sought to purchase Monroe's latest books, Far journeys and Ultimate Journey. In the process of that, I happened to come across a store, in the UK, that was selling the Hemi-Sync Gateway Series CD's at half price.
<br>
<br>
I'm not a great fan of all this (what I call) whacky commercial stuff. But I do have a soft spot for "old man obe" and my instinct told me to give them a try. So I ended up buying the CD's as well as the books.
<br>
<br>
I've heard a number of sound patterns in the past that have claimed to have all kinds of weird and wonderful effects on the brain. Much of it, I say, is just a load of tosh. Not only that, it can be very damaging.
<b>
 The Brain is extremely delicate and incredibly sensitive
</b>
. As such, it is definitely not something that should be messed with.
<br>
<br>
I've said in the past that the mind should be treated with the same degree of tender care that you would adopt when handling a new-born child. Blasting it with an array of mind-bending sounds and lights is really not the way forward.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so the night before I set up a portable player by my bed ready to try the first CD the next morning. I awoke at 4am and started to play the CD. And... wow... what a surprise!
<br>
<br>
I'd listened to the Java-Applet on the Monroe website which gave a demo of "Hemi-Sync" (or so they said). While I don't like to approach things with a fixed mindset, I thought the CD would be more of the same stuff as played by the Applet. In which case I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, get bored, switch the thing off, and get down to some serious projecting. But no, what is on the CD's is nothing remotely like the Applet at all. Which is rather confusing.
<br>
<br>
In fact, the CD's are absolutely flaming brilliant and I cannot recommend them too highly. I have only properly listened to the first CD (Wave 1) as it is obvious they must be learnt sequentially; as the early CD's contain details of exercises you must learn first, otherwise you won't understand what to do in the later CD's.
<br>
<br>
A couple of minor downers:
<br>
<br>
1) An
<u>
 absolute
</u>
beginner, I feel, would find the instruction manual lacking detail about exactly what to do and what to expect. But for someone with a little experience this would not be a problem.
<br>
<br>
2) The voice has a bit of a "Houston Mission Control" feel about it. Which kept making me chuckle, initially, but it's something you quickly get used to.
<br>
<br>
What took me completely by surprise, however, is the sheer quality of the whole production. The subtleness and the gentle way the whole process is handled is absolutely first class. I felt my mind gradually being coaxed into a state of mental stillness. There was no harshness, no weird buzzing and mind-numbing vibratory-type sounds like I had heard on other recordings. No, this is all remarkably different and
<u>
 extremely
</u>
effective!
<br>
<br>
It is blatently obvious that whoever composed those recordings knows a heck of a LOT about how the mind works. They know only too well how, the moment you try and somehow "force" the mind into doing something, it will automatically resist you with the very same degree of force. The more you try and force it, the more it will resist. Which simply puts you into an ever downward spiral.
<br>
<br>
I listened to CD1, Track-1 a couple of times just to get used to the process. Track-1 (relax to Focus 3)  is very basic. Which would be absolutely perfect for beginners. However, someone with a little previous experience in relaxation/meditation will quickly move to Track-2. Which takes you to the body-asleep, mind-awake state which they call: Focus 10.
<br>
<br>
I found the "trip" to Focus 10 very relaxing. It is incredibly professionally done. It's brilliant the way the counting is staged, in the sense of how the timing changes. Your mind is anticipating the next count, but it doesn't come when expected. As a result, a little "hole" is created that your sense of conscious awareness falls into, relaxing ever deeper. Absolutely incredible and nothing like I expected at all.
<br>
<br>
Plus, I just love the way a lot of what is done harmonises with my own thinking. A fact which gives me total confidence in the process. Like, the way they start relaxing from the head. I have often felt that people concentrate too much on the actual mechanics of the Physical relaxation process. Doing that has the tendency to
<i>
 activate
</i>
the mind, not still it. I've said before that the technique is to lie back in a comfortable position and simply allow the mind to become still. As a result, the rest of the body will have a strong tendency to automatically be still. And so it is the same on the CD.
<br>
<br>
They first relax the face and head, and then let that sense of relaxation flow into the brain. At which point I get a delightful sinking feeling which flows from my mind into my whole body. Which, as I say, is basically what I do anyway. Only it took me about 10 years of trial and error to discover it where, with this CD, a person could accomplish the same in only a week or two!
<br>
<br>
<u>
 The Hemi-Sync sounds are ever so subtle
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
You can hardly hear them. As I say, I expected some whacky and irritating kind of buzzing noise like I've heard on recordings in the past. No, it's nothing
<u>
 remotely
</u>
like that. And the effect the sounds have on the mind is ever so wonderful.
<br>
<br>
This morning I listened to Track-2 for only the second time and, following the relaxation process, I felt there was some kind of marble-sized entity present at the centre of my brow: pulsating and vibrating. It was a very similar feeling to what I would occassionally feel before in what used to be my normal projection process. Only this time, instead of relaxing for an hour or so, it happened after only about 10 minutes! In fact, the feeling came over so strongly, my sense of conscious awareness snapped me out of it. But it will become used to the feeling in a short while.
<br>
<br>
Another very important aspect is the CD's are ultimately an aid to self-learning. In that they basically teach you how to perform the whole relaxation process *without* the help of the CD. In fact, on the later CD's you are expected to perform the exercise of reaching Focus 10, for example, all on your own. The voice on the CD simply instructs you to do so, and stays silent for a while. Then it comes back to teach you some of the more advanced stages. That's another reason why the CD's *must* be learnt in the correct order.
<br>
<br>
After my experience, I would say to anyone who is having the remotest difficulty with any aspect of relaxation and/or projection to buy the Gateway Wave-1 CD set * immediately*. Don't bother with the other Waves for now. Because until you are adept at achieving Focus 10 relaxation they will be useless to you.
<br>
<br>
I cannot remember a time when I could so wholeheartedly recommend a product. At the time I was in two minds, shall I or shan't I. My instinct held sway and now I'm just so darned pleased it did.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I suppose I should have known. Drums, poison frogs, drugs. People have used tools to achieve trance and projection for eons.

<br>
Yes, you are quite correct, there really is no substitute for good old-fashioned practice. I could not agree with you more on that.
<br>
<br>
but that's the *brilliant* aspect to these CD's. In that they quickly help you to structure your practice in a very much more controlled way. You still have to do the driving, as it were; and I suppose, in a sense, it is very much like learning to drive; with the CD's performing the function of having an instructor beside you, teaching as you go. Then, once you are proficient enough, you can drive on your own.
<br>
<br>
That's how these CD's are organised. They gradually coax your mind into achieving specific levels of relaxation states. After a while you find you can achieve these states without the CD's. Okay, I suppose the theory behind that is nothing new. But all the stuff I've listened to in the past has been sheer claptrap composed by people who have no real idea of how the mind works.
<br>
<br>
<u>
 But these CD's are truly different
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
As I said in my original post, whoever composed these CD's is VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE about the process of projection. Incredibly so, in fact.
<br>
<br>
You see, for ages I have been floundering around using trial and error in order to discover the best most simple way of projecting. Like, discovering relaxing from the head downwards was far more effective than trying to relax from the feet upwards. That process took me maybe 2-years to fathom all on my own. But it's all there, on the very first CD, for anyone to learn in days!
<br>
<br>
I just wish I'd had these CD's 20 years ago.

I have wave 7, Going home and I ordered yesterday Transcendance.
<br>
<br>
I have also ordered Synthesys products available at:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.synthesys.ws/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
<br>
They are pretty good also....
<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to the software which to be released sometimes by Hemi-sync. The software allows you to create your own cd's. Kinda like brainwave generator but hopefully easier to use than brainwave generator.

Hey Hey
<br>
<br>
It's good to see other peoples experiences when first taking the big plunge into the gateway cd's/tapes &amp; your post Frank made me go through the lot again &amp; I had one of the best OBE's last night,because of it.Just having it on the brain so much &amp; then going through the cd's &amp; tapes &amp; read a bit of Astral Dynamics.I was at a castle surrounded by water on three sides &amp; had a perculiar contstruction on top of one of it's towers.I talked briefly with some people,which gave me a brilliant idea for an essay I have to do on genetics &amp; insurance.Very cool &amp; most grateful,thanks to them &amp; thanks  Frank for posting it &amp; inspiring me into action.
<br>
<br>
BTW if you choose to go down this path of getting the gateway cd's,do just that,get the cd's,don't make the same mistake I made &amp; get the tapes.The tapes are allright,but for a bit more money,you get a superior recording,no tape hissing,no walkman slamming off on you at the end of the tape &amp; destroying your state of mind,no constant changing tape sides from A to B &amp; no risk of the tape getting chewed up! Its Ok if you are just getting one of their single tapes such as transcendance as they are cheap anyway,but the gateway is probably the most you have ever spent on anything on tape or cd,so get the cd. I am in the process of replacing them all on cd &amp; will sell the others when I've got the set of cd's,for this commitment it involved me having to get a discman which only cost me $50,but at the end of that spending spree do I think it was worth it? #*%# yeah!
<br>
<br>
Manfred I think Daniel got that Transcendance cd as well,so you will both have to tell us of your journey's,sounds cool.What is Going home like for you? is it worth getting ?
<br>
<br>
One other thing,I tried using Robert Bruces NEW while listening to Hemi Sync &amp; whoah! I never realized the potential for this NEW application &amp; after buiding my resonant energy balloon on the first CD I used NEW.I would love to have some tests done to measure what is happening,as it feels incredible.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys all

Mobius,
<br>
<br>
I intend to start with the going home program this summer. I haven't done a thing with it seriously. After this summer I'll have the Going home program hopefully finished and you'll hear about it then.
<br>
<br>
It was Daniel that made me buy it. I read his reports on the forums and decided that I'd like to try that also.
