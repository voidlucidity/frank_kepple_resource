I've heard that to astral project you need to meditate first right? I'm very restless and find it hard to meditate. Will I ever be able to have an OBE? Please write if you have any tips/suggestions.

Lots of information on there!  And I'm pretty sure your question has been answered in one of those topics.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
If it helps, as I've said a number of times on this forum: I never engage in any kind of meditation or energy-work yet I can project with little difficulty, provided my physical body is in a fairly relaxed state. So I do virtually all my work in the morning following sleep.
<br>
<br>
You might want to explore meditation and/or energy-work techniques, as you never know what's going to work for you until you try it. But there is no rule that says you have to, like, if you don't meditate then you can't obe. I did go through a phase myself of activating various bodily energy centres. This can give you some really way-out sensations that are great to experience.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
