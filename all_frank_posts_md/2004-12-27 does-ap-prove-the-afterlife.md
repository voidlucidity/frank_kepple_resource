No, but if it is correct that the "afterlife", as well as APs, take place "outside" of  the body, then APs will support the idea of an afterlife.

Wow iank, I'm surprised by your attitude being a newbie to the site...
<br>
<br>
Let me guess, you know it all and no one can tell you what to think and you have years of supressed emotions and actions under your belt from over bearing parents and you are totally tired of not being heard or given the answers you want to hear, right?

<br>
Unfortunately an amount of clever thinking is necissary when discussing the paranormal. Because some of the things, at first glance, seem to go against logic, you have to be creative in order to explain what's going on, at which point you finally find the logic to it.
<br>
<br>
Think about it this way: IF you can ap and you are answering[EDIT: I meant to say asking here...hmm]  this question, then no it does not prove it, however it does provide extreme evidince which will force even some of the most hardcore skeptics to ponder for a bit once they experience this and their experience is proven as valid.
<br>
<br>
Speaking from experience, ap in of itself does not prove the afterlife, but explorations while projecting will, once you have proven to yourself that your projection experiences are real.

SpectralDragon, there's no clever thinking involved in demonstrating proof. I realize what you're saying - you need to be clever in order to AP. But demonstrable evidence is best when communicated without clever terminology or use of words like, for instance, when people do "cold reading." That's all iank meant by not being clever, I presume.

Does not strike me in any way as being particularly civil or friendly.
<br>
The majority of people on here are actually in the process of helping themselves, to learn, expand, grow and reject information when the need arises. In the process many are generous enough to actually try to help or advise others as far as their experience can.  This to me is an act deserving of a civil tongue and a measure of respect, at least for the consideration of the time given if nothing else.
<br>
<br>
The problem with text only of course is we cannot read into words what would be conveyed by meeting, through body language and emotion. So you sound uncivil and unfriendly with the above quote. That may not be true. Yes there may be lots of issues you have that none of us can actually guess at. However if you have the intelligence to use the Internet, you also have the intelligence to think more deeply about what you say.
<br>
Your question is perfectly reasonable, and I'd like to have answers also. I suspect those answers won't be nice and simple. I'd like simple answers too at times.
<br>
My suggestion would be to explore more deeply if the question is important enough to you.
<br>
This isn't a flame, I don't know you and cannot judge beyond what I read. You sound angry, but it's easy to sound different from what you are actually like on the Internet.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
The answer to your question is no, the ability
<i>
 in itself
</i>
proves nothing.
<br>
<br>
But... if you gain a little experience in doing so, and begin exploring with an open mind and asking questions, etc. The chances are you
<i>
 will
</i>
come across irrefutable evidence that proves to you beyond doubt, that we do in fact survive physical-body death.

Hi iank
<br>
<br>
As Frank said, you need to experience it for yourself and decide whether or not the experience proves the afterlife for you.  For many it does.  For many it doesn't!
<br>
<br>
So my answer to you would be to try it and see.
<br>
<br>
On the subject of the afterlife you might like to investigate the
<i>
 Scole Report
</i>
.  This may have been a huge hoax, or it may have been real.  Nobody has disproven it as yet:

SpectralDragon, I think we confused each other about something very trivial, so it's not worth much intellectual struggle. But I hope we can establish a more harmonious dialogue, especially since the subject is about dialogue itself.

<br>
If they do not think like you do, does that mean you have different concepts of what the word "afterlife" means?
<br>
<br>
If everyone agreed on the definition of afterlife, it would be very clear to discuss proof of its existence. But since the word is interpreted variously, it's not that easy and one has to be clever to communicate the truth. Is that what you meant?

<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
Well sure it could ....if you projected and saw after life forms like spirits  and confirmed them to be recognizable and interactive testimony  .
<br>
<br>
Projection beyond the astral could show you firsthand about life after death because other dimensions hold higher consciousness afterlife forms but then can we trust our own perceptions ??
<br>
<br>
So yes it can and it will if you can replicate and confirm your perceptions .
<br>
I have a confirmation sign that helps me confirm if I got it right .
<br>
<br>
If you project with others and they see and hear what you do that helps . But can you trust them (just being a devil's advocate here ) it could still be a mass hallucination ....but it does help you feel better lol .
<br>
<br>
But if you can't project with others then share and confirm online like in this forum ... that is if we can all keep an open mind and affirm and confirm each other ....
<br>
<br>
Do you recall  what Rodney said ,"Can't we'all just git along ??"

<section>
Well Iank, the answer you will have to find in yourself.  No one can tell you what to think, but what I believe is that the plane in which OBE's, AP's, etc. occur in is actually the afterlife itself.  But technically speaking, since the spirit body lives inside the physical one, there is no afterlife then is there?  The question I am trying to find out is that why our spirit bodies were put into these transient ones.  After all, you wouldn't trade a Dodge Viper for a Ford Taurus.  But again, this is just what I am thinking.

<section>
LucidMoon, have you ever considered that in fact, the physical body is contained within the energy body/spirit, not the other way round? I believe that since the energetic part of ourselves is the permanent aspect, the transitory physical is simply a small congealed/crystallised focal point within our greater energy. It's good to twist our common beliefs on their head sometimes!
