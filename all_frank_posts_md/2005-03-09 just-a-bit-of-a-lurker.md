Hullo, I am a 20 year old guy who is curious about most of the topic that these forums cover. I have sleep paralysis, dream lucidly out of those on occasion, and have possibly opened the 'third eye' quite accidently once. I have also had hallucinations while in SP, both auditory and visual.
<br>
<br>
One time had a possible OBE or something (not even sure what it'd be called); it seemed as though I was seeing from another entities perspective that was behind me, looking towards me. I was fully awake, standing, and waiting for the crosswalk signal to change. This was, needless to say, very odd. It's never re-occured. If anyone could give me some insight on this, it would be nice.
<br>
<br>
I am naturally a skeptic, I try to figure out alternatives and possiblilites to what has been said to have happend. I don't like taking things at face value either. Just the way I am.

Nice to actually write one of these, couldn't see the introductory forums before.

Hi lines,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting your introduction. Of course even though you've joined a while ago, its nice to read here of your experiences. We've recently added a new forum. Check out our FAQ forum for topics such as OBE, Astral Projection, Phasing, Lucid Dreaming, and more. You may like comparing notes with the experiences you've written about.
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing more from you!

... Wow. I joined in 2003?! I haven't really used the account, mostly just checked the forums once in a blue moon when the mood hit me. Only posted once or twice until yesterday, when I decided I needed to post things.

Yeah, figured I'd get some of the things that didn't fit into my normal view of 'how it's supposed to be' out again and see what knowledge comes from those.
