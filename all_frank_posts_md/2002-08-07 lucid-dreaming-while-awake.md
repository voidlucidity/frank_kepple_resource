Hi all
<br>
<br>
The other night I think I had a lucid dream without going to sleep. I was lying in bed trying to get to sleep, when I saw glitter falling, then a 'film' started. I was watching this 'film' but I was very aware of my surroundings, I could hear cars passing, ppl shouting (coming home from the pub), my hubby snoring etc.
<br>
The film was only a few minutes long, at the end again the glitter.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to lucid dream while awake

Hi Shadow,
<br>
To answer your question ... YES.  It is called a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD) ... and that's fantastic that you had one ... they're always a nice extra treat!
<br>
<br>
From reading your post, I would guess that you were very much ALERT and not falling asleep (losing consciousness) ... most people would become frustrated at this, and toss and turn, toss and turn.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My first two OBE's were a result of a "spontaneous" WILD, back at Christmas last year.  I was very much awake and alert, layed down to "relax" my neck muscles multiple times a day ... and ended up keeping full consciousness as I entered one lucid dream, then back to "darkness", then into another lucid dream, then into an OBE, back to "darkness" and then finally into another OBE in the "darkness".
<br>
<br>
I am thinking that the "key" to consciously re-creating this "state" is to be mentally and physically refreshed before laying down to relax ... staying completely still ... and becoming an observer (remaining emotionally detached) of the 'back of your eyelids'.  Eventually, you enter the Body Asleep Mind Awake state ... and the sky is the limit from there (Well ... not really! LOL!).
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

i have been trying to have wild's for a while now but they seem pretty hard, does anyone know of someone else who  has had a lot of experience in this and would be able to give better instructions. it would be incredible to be able to lay down whenever you wanted to and induce one.

Yes it is very possible. Children do it a lot, usually when you want them to pay attention to something important.

Hi mark
<br>
<br>
Yes I can remeber what was in the 'film' There was a little girl about 5-6 wearing a blue top, she had very long blonde hair, she was twirling in the street her hair was flying around her head her arms out to her side, the little girl stumbled into the road but a woman with short dark hair caught her.
<br>
<br>
The nx scene I was in a dark home office a man was on the phone he was sitting in a swival chair he had on black lace up shoes white socks, with dark trousers, I couldn't see past his waist but saw the telephone cord. Just to my right I saw an open door leading to a kitchen the woman (who was out of focus) was serving coffee.
<br>
<br>
In the nx scene I was standing in a brightly lit living room on one wall there was a long white leather settee, opposite that was a tv with a games console underneath, I caught a glimpse of a video game didn't get the title but saw the colours red and yellow.
<br>
<br>
Then the glitter fell again and i opened my eyes

I was just about to post a topic similar to this! This is what happens to me: I'll be waking in the morning, coming out of a dream. I'll hit my snooze button and lie on my back, and attempt not nessicarily to project, but just to observe my state of conciousness. What has happended several times is that I fall back into a dream, even though I'm awake with my eyes open! And I say it in my head "I'm awake and dreaming right now! How can this be?" Has this happened to anyone else?
