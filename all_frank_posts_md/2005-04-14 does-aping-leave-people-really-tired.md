Last night I tried to AP again, and almost did, but I notice that the slightest sounds while trying to AP dont let me leave. Like if I hear the buzzing sound and feel the spinning in my chest area(HEART CHAKRA) , if I hear something it will mess up my concentration and I will just be in bed with my mind awake, but my body asleep.
<br>
<br>
Also, sometimes I just lie there and sometimes cant fall asleep. Anyone have these issues? Does APing mess up your sleeping paterns?

yeah, it happens. Its due to excitement when we are about to leave body. .. . and it causes a bit of tachycardia

And, dont worry, keep practising and you will get used to it and will eventually be able to ignore disturbances while attempting an OBE

It has taken me about 3 years off and on to develop the concentration, willpower, focus, relaxation techniques, and attitude to ap.  There was periods in the past where just the tiniest thing would mess me up, or I would lay awake for hours, usually 2, after I had tried to ap either too energized to sleep, too tired to sleep (its hard to explain) or too obsessed with asking myself why I couldn't AP.  Its a long process.  I would stress bare awareness to you.  Just watch what is happening.  You hear a sound?  Just hear it, observe it, watch it pass.  You have a stray thought?  Do the same.  In time you will be a totally focused observer of your own mind and body, which is a good skill to have to begin with.  Good luck.

Hi izalco
<br>
<br>
On the contrary - projecting leaves me feeling very much alive and awake!
<br>
<br>
However,
<i>
 concentrating
</i>
on
<i>
 trying
</i>
to project is very tiring.  I stopped doing this and these days, I simply lie back, relax and see what happens next, without any expectations.
<br>
<br>
You are going to have to get used to the buzzing sounds and the sensation of spinning
<u>
 to the point of boredom
</u>
, and then you will move on to the next "step".
<br>
<br>
It's the oddest thing - your mental state has to be one of mild curiosity and nonchalance before anything will happen.  Which most of the time doesn't correlate to the excitement and sheer exhilaration you feel when you have actually done it!
<br>
<br>
And yes, sometimes I can't fall asleep, even though I maintain I am incredibly relaxed (physically).  What I do at these times is tell myself not to worry - I'm getting rest - and I'll drift into a daydream or two, which keeps me occupied for a good long while, and invariably I fall asleep eventually, even if it's hours later.
<br>

I have noticed that although my body is asleep or relaxed, ect, my mind is still awake. It is a strange feeling indeed. Only thing is, last night I laid in bed, trying to AP, but nothing, then I had a hard time getting to sleep, even though my body was asleep (in a sense)
<br>
<br>
Today, for lunch I went outside and sat in my car for an hour, and tried to AP , and I would still lay there, and relax, but not sleep.
<br>
<br>
I seem to get to the point where my body is asleep, and my mind awake, but dont know where to go from there. For some reason, the food truck guy kept popping in my head saying.. "how about those Yankees".
<br>
<br>
I listened to the brainwave generator presets in my car, to drown out the noise, and it seems to work pretty good. Just last night, even though I slept per say, I woke up extremely tired.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Sounds are something which bother me even now. Personally, I don't know how people manage to project while listening to music, for example. Fortunately, where I live it's deathly quiet at night. During the day there is a little hustle and bustle. I found wearing ear-plugs helps enormously. Even though it's deathly quiet at night, earplugs still help for some reason. I think it's because my attention is more easily directed inwards.
<br>
<br>
You can't shut your ears off as easily as you can your sight, for example. So the action of shutting your ears down has some kind of definite beneficial effect. Well, it does with me. I suppose it has become a little ritual. The action of putting ear-plugs in sends a powerful message to myself, saying right, time to turn my attention inwards.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi , what I tried on my break was to listen to the brainwave sounds while in my car. I found that this drowns out noises that wake me up.
<br>
<br>
But when trying to AP at night, I find at night I feel my heart chakra "spinning" and I hear a buzzing sound, but the littlest thing always breaks my concentration. It seems that when APing sounds (to me at least) are amplified.

About being tired, last year or so i made an experiment on AP. I tried so hard, during the day, to AP, that i got very tired. I was ok, then went to bed a little just to AP. I didnt get anything but when i got up, my body was shacking like if i was very sick.
<br>
<br>
My problem was just thet i tried to hard without being relaxed both in mind and body...
<br>
<br>
About the buzzing sounds, i am not an APer, but my experiments shows me that they are the normal soound of your surroundings so much amplified that they look like monsters. Thats the main reason why we only hear bad noises. They are not bad: they just look bad.
<br>
<br>
Of course that when you hear that you are in an almost dream state and yourmind will make you hear or see what its not there.
<br>
<br>
This is what i think.

To me I think it just takes mental conditioning.  Like a while ago I was going in and out of lucid dreams for about an hour and that day and the next I was SO tired.  But actually today I had at least 2 OBE's and I was going in and out of lucid dreams for about 2-3 hours, and I feel fine.
<br>
<br>
I think the more I meditate, raise energy, and OBE/Lucid Dream, my energy level goes way up and replenishes a lot faster as well.

It's something very interesting. Sometimes when I force an exit, like I force some movements to crawl away from my body, it makes me very tired when I return. I feel like I was not breathing at all cause there is such a gasp for breath. At times I feel like I left my body frozen from stomach down as if it was sort of dead, it's hard to move again cause I'm so sooo tired it hurts. Anyone feels like this?
