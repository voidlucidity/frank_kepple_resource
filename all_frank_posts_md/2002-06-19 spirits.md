Yes, I often wondered that. I always supposed it was just all different races of people, over the years, experimenting with fermenting all kinds of fruits and berries and so forth. Then it must just be that some taste in particular catches the popular imagination, and bingo.

Hi quant,
<br>
A friend of mine was questioning me on this and many other things to:) Especially if there are no 'new' souls or spirits then how come the worlds population is increasing. I was really pondering that for a time. I was familiar with soul groups which Seth has discussed in his books and that seemed like a good explaination...but this person always wanted proof:) I then had the opportunity to do a reading for a friend who was of Indian descent and had quite an extensive spiritual background. You could just tell by being around him that he was 'a very old soul'. I found that when I looked at his face I had a hard time focusing on him. His face shifted and blurred like he was existing in several places at once. I wondered how that could be and I got the visual refrence of an umberella being open. The handle and up to where it met the spokes were the main soul or spirit energy source. Each spoke going off of the main was another life, all living here on the earth at the same time and some in communication with each other. It was a quite diverse group of people and my friend being one of these spokes. I understood that he was aware of several of these different spokes but others were not. He would shift in and out checking and helping these other people. So as to a new soul, I would think that the main spirit branches off, splits itself and creates new lives. I also imagine that as these splits grow in energy and transfer energy/experience to the main branch.. they would also be able to split off... creating a giant spiritual family tree:) Hope this helps...

WF, when you say they "check and help" do you mean in the physical, like, they lived just a few miles apart, or was it through some kind of telepathy, or some kind of clubhouse on the Astral they created?
<br>
<br>
Also, when you say "reading" could I ask what is that, exactly.

I'm sorry if I am missing the obvious but all this "past life" stuff holds a particular fascination for me and I'm struggling to understand all the terminology.

Hiya Frank,

<br>
<br>
It was more of an innate connection that they had. How it came about was that when I focused in on him I kept seeing the faces of other people and I thought to my self...oh many past lives influencing this one. But then I was shown, no, these are his soul group and they are living on the earth at the same time. Placed all over the world... I saw one woman and she was oriental...he was she/he was connected to she. I thougth wow really interesting.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Also, when you say "reading" could I ask what is that, exactly.
</i>
<br>
I have this need to help others and so when I started on my spiritual path at 17 I started reading auras and doing a short intuitive paragraph on whatever came to mind as being helpful for the person involved. It has progressed to a real mixture of things as I've developed myself more. I do a bit of trance channeling with a message, can still do auras... I sort of let go and ask spirit to take me to where I can access the best information is for this person. Lately I have found myself traveling out of body to the person, especially if the person is asking about a love relationship. To check out what is relevent by being there. It took me by suprise the first time it happened but the info that came back to the person was exciting to her and me both. Sometimes I get a graphic little movie about the person and in these cases I wish I could draw better..so I describe what I see to them and it helps them.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 I'm sorry if I am missing the obvious but all this "past life" stuff holds a particular fascination for me and I'm struggling to understand all the terminology.
</i>
<br>
<br>
...understand all of the terminology.. you and me both!:) It's one thing to do all of this stuff, another to try and relay it to others and I have such a compulsion to do so:)
<br>
The way that I have found my belief in past lives was to actually access one that plays a very important part in this life. It was of a native life and I was called waterfall.  The discovery of that life has made such a strong impact on this life, that I can't imagine not having past lives.
<br>
So maybe with all of your excellent work  and practice that you are doing... you will be able to remember a pivitol past life. I mean if you think about it how we build our experiences/knowledge with each life (generally speaking). Then what you are doing now is just a process of remembering what you have done in many lifetimes before.  We're not learning for the first time but building on this knowledge that we innately have.
<br>
hope this helps:)

You say, "The way that I have found my belief in past lives was to actually access one that plays a very important part in this life. It was of a native life and I was called waterfall."
<br>
<br>
If I may ask, what is the important part the past life plays in your current life?
<br>
<br>
Also, how did you contact this life? Do you have an idea of where your focal point of awareness is, in your brain, at the time you make contact?
<br>
<br>
It's just you mention about when doing the "reading" saying, "When I focused in on him I kept seeing faces..... " Is it possible for you to be more specific as to how you achieve this focusing.
<br>
<br>
 The basic question is focus what, where?

<br>
<br>
Waterfall was a pivitol past life for me, the feeling of sacred comes to mind...I can't go into it too much here but I had certain fears, negative thinking, even friends that I had felt I knew forever but had just met... some of these things were explained. Other things were explained through other past life ties and influences. And so.. I feel better about myself and understand myself better.
<br>
I also became conscious of my main spirit guide who was my father back then, White Eagle.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Also, how did you contact this life? Do you have an idea of where your focal point of awareness is, in your brain, at the time you make contact?
</i>
<br>
It came at a time of great stress and reaching out to spirit for help...during my seperation. I wasn't eating or sleeping well but meditating constantly to help me with my nerves when everything started to unfold. Spirit said simply that it was time. I think I sort of had myself on a not planned, spirit quest.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 It's just you mention about when doing the "reading" saying, "When I focused in on him I kept seeing faces..... " Is it possible for you to be more specific as to how you achieve this focusing.
</i>
<br>
When I saw the faces I was looking at him spiritually... just like how you would see auras... softly focus on the person, relax and then let the focus go to whatever comes out for you to see...but be aware of everything you experience. You have to be very receptive and nonjudgemental about the information. For instance what your hear, feel, smell, infused knowledge.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 The basic question is focus what, where?
</i>
<br>
Now everyone is different we all come from certain strengths, such as a feeler, visionary, audio etc. I started out beng very visual but now have developed the other sides so I get knowledge coming at me from every direction about the person. Sometimes I even become the person, which is not always a good way to go about the task *grin*
<br>
My focus area is in the third eye, I can even generate voltage from my third eye. My boyfriend who is a great healer generates voltage from his hands. The area in my head would be from the third eye back, up the forehead and then into the middle, upper of the brain...but there is also a connection to spirit and energy flowing through that *is* the focus.
<br>
When I channel info its more like opening up the crown chakra..so very top of head and then having what youwould visualize as a funnel coming down into my body.
<br>
One thing I would like to suggest, if you haven't already is to get into an energy/healing practice such as reiki, seichim even trantric where the energy exchanges are very powerful. I feel that you need a real teacher to help you learn. Reading is good but the actual practice and energy exchanges from your teacher are a real asset.  If you try tantric be very careful and take baby steps, even I get my kundalini messed up once in a while and it's hard to get it balanced out again....can become very uncomfortable.

WF: I've been working on understanding what you have said so far, and I have some more questions, if I may.
<br>
<br>
You say you softly focus on the person and see whatever comes about. But where do you see whatever it is that comes about? Are the visions seen with the physical eyes or are you perceiving visons at the front of your mind with what is often called a 3rd eye? You say you focus with your 3rd eye but I'm confused as to what organ you are using to see the visions.
<br>
<br>
You see, this morning I think I discovered something. I found out that I can activate my 3rd-eye (or Astral Visual Interface, as I call it) without doing any of the "letting go of the body" stuff. I got the idea from your doing the "reading". It's quite tricky to do because the moment I "see" something my physical eyes try to look. Which is basically the same problem I used to have with projection, before I learnt how to relax to the extent where I had very little feeling of the physical.
<br>
<br>
Now, because I was fully aware of the physical, I did not have any of my normal pre-projection symptoms. Oh, and I fully understood where you say about it's like a funnel going to the top of the head. With me it feels like some kind of tractor-beam.
<br>
<br>
So it appears, then, if you "let go" of the physical and active the areas of your brain that are in contact with the Astral, then you project within it. Which is what I am familiar with.
<br>
<br>
However, I am now coming to realise that these areas of the mind can actually be accessed without letting go of the physical at all. Is this correct?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Frank,
<br>
When softly focusing on a person I try and become open to the possibilities. So don't focus on visual only...That's where you can't limit yourself with judgement about what and how you perceive things. Everyone is different, almost like each person has a different language of communication. I've found that each reading is a learning experience and never the same. For me I see the energy of the person and receive a feeling, emotion, smell or feel a pain. I then follow that to see what is causing it, (I think at this point my energy is focused out of my body or I open up as a receiver) then I will get a picture or something like a little movie that runs in my mind. I'm sorry but I can't tell you where it's processed because sometimes I blank out for a second and wake up with the information. Other times I get sort of an infused information with amazing details. Other times just a name or a word.
<br>
<br>
Heres a few questions for you:)
<br>
Do you see auras? do you have any channeling experience?
<br>
<br>

Which is basically the same problem I used to have with projection, before I learnt how to relax to the extent where I had very little feeling of the physical.
</i>
<br>
<br>
On waking is excellent too because your not quite all with it yet and still pulling your energies back from the astral. Right... I understand about looking at it... so if you are aware of it, whatever you are seeing. It has popped out to say hello. Then you need to find out what it is... I would just ask spirit/guides, what is that? Understanding that even if you don't see it anymore it is still there. Now that we're talking about it..I have the third eye going when I see the energy, then I can sort of detach my third eye from my physical eyes and they then can move etc. The third eye feels thick, heavy, pulling and almost protruding from my forehead and moving. (the first time I felt it move like a large ball rolling around under the skin and focusing onthings, my stomache kind of flopped, it felt different)(It used to get sore and ache too when I was getting it going so be aware of that)
<br>
So by keeping my eyes active but relaxing everything else except that third eye area more visuals would open up to me.
<br>
I remember when I was practicing to consciously obe and I'd be 'out' and in a few seconds I would become aware that I was out..I'd get so excited and think, I did it!! and slam back into my body:)

<br>
Absolutely, but it's harder to get and maintain a clear/true experience when your still connected to the world around you. But then you can talk, write, carry on a simple converation.
<br>
I wonder if when I go and 'visit' a person while I'm doing this..it would be seen as bi-location?
<br>
<br>
You know you'd probably be an excellent channeler if your so inclined and not already one. the tractor beam feeling on your head sounds like it to me.
<br>
<br>
Well this has been fun and great for me to try and figure out how all of this has come about for me. I'm sort of like the chicken without the egg?
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

<section>
WF: I'm sorry but I don't really know what an Aura is. Something about colours that are radiated from people but I never saw any. I've seen lots of whirling colours on the Astral, though. As for channelling, well, I read about it on some website but it all seemed a bit far fetched if I may say. Thing is, with me, the moment I start hearing any kind of mystical terminology my mind has great difficulty trying to reason with it.
<br>
<br>
But thank you again for a very informative reply. The last line holds a particular resonance with me because that is exactly how I used to be with Astral Projection. About 3 or 4 times a week I'd wake up early morning and, about half an hour later, I'd get pre-projection vibrations and shoot off (rather like I'd been shot from a cannon) and I'd come to rest within the Astral somewhere.
<br>
<br>
I had been doing this for over 10 years, and found the experiences very enjoyable. Though for around 5 years prior to that, I had spent fighting demons, and the like, in a region I later termed the "training ground".
<br>
<br>
Basically the Astral, to me, was a huge adventure playground and it was only when I came across this BBS that I began to try and slow things down so I could analyse what, exactly, was happening. Mainly so I could explain the process to others. However, in doing so, I discovered all kinds of new sensations.
<br>
<br>
The most interesting discovery, that I made recently, is I can develop a focal point of awareness and place it in what I perceive as different areas of the brain. I also discovered that within my brain there was a kind of tension, in a particular area, that if I "massaged away" it would simply switch off all feeling of my physical body.
<br>
<br>
Now I am realising all kinds of other sensations. It is still *very* hit and miss but if I place my focal point of awareness about my forehead something seems to "switch on". There's a kind of zuuump feeling then I see a flash of something or other, then I snap back as the physical eyes try to look and see.
<br>
<br>
Another interesting notion you have given me is the idea of something "popping out". I have only ever thought of it as me "stepping in".
<br>
<br>
It's also interesting you talking of asking guides because I realised, again just recently, that I can communicate with other entities just prior to projecting within the Astral. It's at the point that I call the "stepping in" stage. Where normally all sensation of the physical has gone, I can see the Astral in front of me, then I mentally step into it.
<br>
<br>
Only now, and it's very weird for me, I can do very much the same but I have total awareness of the physical. However, I cannot step into it like normal. Which is why the term "popping out" feels much more apt.
<br>
<br>
I also like your term "spirit" so this morning I focused to the top of my head where I felt a kind of resonance and asked if anyone was in tune with me. And I swear I heard this friendly male-sounding voice welcoming me. I forget exactly what was said because I got so surprised I snapped out of it immediately!!!
<br>
<br>
There were two aspects of his response that really threw me. The first was the fact that he knew me, as he welcomed me by name. And the other was that he said he'd been waiting for me, or it was perhaps more like he was expecting me. Now that was weird. On the Astral I have spoken to loads of people but it all seems very natural. But to be lying there, fully in the knowledge that I'm in the physical (I can even hear my wife breathing by my side), and have some Astral entity wanting to chat like we were long lost friends was rather mind-blowing.
<br>
<br>
I did try and do it again but for some reason the protective aspects of my awareness got really nervous, which prevented me. I have long since learnt that trying to "will" yourself to do things is rather self-defeating. But I hope to be able to coax my protective sense of awareness into accepting the new sensations, I suppose, in the same way I had to when learning how to project.
<br>
<br>
Okay, if I may, another question: You say, "the first time I felt it move like a large ball rolling around under the skin." Could I ask please, what were you doing prior to this? In other words, how did you get to activate it the first time? Is there some kind of excercise in particular that is necessary?
<br>
<br>
Also, the past few days, I have a kind of sensation about the middle of my forehead which I never used to have. The sensation is there constantly and it feels like there's a small circle of paper stuck to the middle of my forehead. Only it feels like it's actually underneath the skin.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your responses, they are very helpful to me.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

G,day Frank
<br>
<br>
I,ve been having that same problem for a couple of months now &amp; from most metaphysical books the problem is diagnosed as an over active brow chakra or third eye, however from the more science based information sources &amp; sources that don't come from religous text e.g Pagans, remote native tribes; it is the pineal gland which is refered to, the little sucker that sits exactly centre of the two hemispheres of the brain.
<br>
<br>
It's really been bothering me &amp; at times has got to the point where I just want to claw at it &amp; dig the little sucker out of my head &amp; the symptoms sound the same as what you are describing Frank, a small circle in the middle of your head only just under the skin, I'm sure it was the same thing Waterfall was describing too.
<br>
<br>
From all metaphysical books I've read, it is suggested to stop all OBE activity for a little while, maybe a week. The problem is I tried this for two weeks &amp; still no relief so I went to the doctors. He said it was nothing to worry about &amp; that it was similar to when the glands in your neck just under the jaw line go up &amp; down periodically during your life. I wasn't happy with the answer as I had to leave with no more answers than when I started.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, to my way of thinking, because the pineal gland sits in the middle of the two hemispheres of the brain, it is somehow a junction or a mixing point of information or energy produced by the two hemispheres. For some reason we don't use both sides of our brain in syncronisation, that is using equal amounts of thought from each side to make decisions, most people are either predominantly left brain thinkers or right brain thinkers.
<br>
<br>
You can use physical execises to promote syncronisation, use a compound or application (not advisable) &amp; there is Hemi-Sync, which does it with sound.

I've read some amazing stories lately in my quest to find out more about the third eye/ brow chakra/ pineal gland, as it something I personally have to deal with &amp; is a bit annoying, also the last time I had this much activity in my brow chakra/ third eye/ pineal gland, I received a huge strobe to my forehead &amp; this time around I hope to be prepared for it.

Thanks, Mobius, for your informative reply. I wasn't thinking of the feeling as a problem. More of simply a new sensation. In a sense it feels like a kind of awakening. From what Waterfall has said it appears to me that the brow chakra, to more advanced students of the art, can be felt constantly: with a greater or lessor depth of feeling depending on whether it is activate or not.
<br>
<br>
It's funny you should mention about using the two halves of the brain synchronously. Because that is exactly what I have been practising. I scouted the Web for information on seeing Auras and came across a site that gave this picture of two circles and you look at them and form a third circle in the centre.

They said that when you see this third circle in a particular way, you are focusing your awareness at the dead centre of the brain. The website talks about this exercise increasing the sensitivity of the physical eyes. But, personally, I think they are mistaken on that.
<br>
<br>
What I think they are doing, by holding a focal point of awareness at the very centre of the forehead, is activating the brow chakra. And I think it is the brow-chakra that "sees" the Aura, not the physical eyes. Which aligns with Waterfall's reply to my question on this.
<br>
<br>
It is quite tricky to do as your focus tends to flip from one hemisphere to the other. But yesterday I managed to hold it constant for about 15 minutes. Then I got this weird feeling and suddenly I saw these visions all around me. They looked like simple line drawings of objects that were slightly out of focus. The first thing that came to mind, as to what I might be "seeing", was stray energy. Of the like I often see just before mentally stepping into the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Oh, when you say a huge strobe, do you mean a bright flash of light, like a camera flash? Because I experience these sometimes and I wondered what they were.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hey Frank
<br>
<br>
That is good that your brow chakra is not a problem for you &amp; is not actually hurting, as mine has got to the point where it's just plain annoying. I was practicing some music today &amp; the music soothed it for a while, so maybe I should play more music,hehe.
<br>
<br>
On the strobe effect, yes , just like a camera flash, brilliant white &amp; appears to come through your forehead. I have had many little ones over the years, but the big one I was talking about happened about 13 years ago &amp; came in a series of strobes. I could feel this energy build up inside me &amp; I felt a bit like I was a human tesla coil.
<br>
<br>
The problem is when it happened, it was spontaneous &amp; I wasn't doing anything more than laying down on the bed. I was actually trying to escape from it, like I was under attack from some unseen thing trying to shoot brilliant white balls of light or energy into my head. I wish I knew back then what I know now as I would have gone with the flow. From all accounts though, they seem to be associated with psychic growth, some psychic execise of a sort.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the link I'll give it a try. On exercises for strengthening syncronisation between the two halfs of the brain, I've heard that one of the best methods for doing this is 'juggling'. It manually forces the two halfs of the brain into working together by using your left &amp; right arm. I've been trying this on &amp; off for a while, not that good yet, with 3 balls I mean &amp; 2 hands. It can't be one hand juggling or juggling with any less than 3 balls. I've got to sit on the floor to do it, as I get sick of bending down to pick them up.

Waterfall,
<br>
<br>
Wonderful posts...I would like to know more about the face changing phenomena. I have been told, and accused, by past girlfriends and several stranges, that on occasion, my face had changed with what appeared to be afterimages or alterations which resembled people of different cultures and time periods. I have connected with this on only 3 or so occasions myself when also feeling like such people but never gave it much thought after that. I was certain that the phenomena was somehow linked to possible past lives but the way you describe it, multiple souls in a soul group would also make perfect sense.
<br>
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
Oahn
