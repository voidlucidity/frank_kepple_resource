Hello, All:
<br>
<br>
I'm presently co-authoring a book with Robert Bruce called "Mastering Astral Projection: A 90-Day Guide to and Out-of-body Experience".  This is based (very loosely) off the 90-day guide I developed, available for download on Robert's web site.
<br>
<br>
I'm currently working on the chapter on fears and wanted solicit your thoughts.  What fears do you have (or did you have) re: having and OBE?  I think we're addressing pretty much all of the common fears, but I wanted to get any idea of what your fears are (or were) to make sure we're not missing anything obvious.
<br>
<br>
So, describe your fears here.  No fear is too small or dumb.
<br>

This is not exactly a fear but something I'm sure bothers others as well.
<br>
The actual exit sensations that, at least for me come, rather unexpectedly tend to startle me out of focus. Having felt them once I sometimes get in a loop trying to brace for them thus failing to feel them at all. Then once I realize that I'm blocking myself I relax and get startled out of my concentration again by the feelings.
<br>
<br>
As far as fears I don't have any big ones really, just a little queasiness after some experiences. But make sure you cover sleep paralysis and astral noises. I think these are what freak a lot of people, at least after suddenly waking up to them (bin there, got freaked).

I know that most people will say that demonic posessions can't really happen, but I'm extremely terrified of it.  That's why I take extra precautions to make sure my body will be safe (i.e. praying for a safe journey).

I am actually more concernd about the other people in the house.  As in I may attract some thing and it going after some one else in the house.  I see this as a problem because they are mildly touched as well and are largly unaware of what I do.  I also feel that they are not as capable of protecting themselves as they may think.  Such issues have arised in the past.

Hey there BriMercer....
<br>
<br>
How about the fear that you are condemning yourself to an eternal punishment for messing around with such things as OBE's?  I know that many people have been indoctrinated into strict, religious belief systems.  Although they feel that OBE's need to be explored, there is also a HUGE burden on them, because they have always been told that these types of experiences are "of the devil."
<br>
<br>
So I would think a fear worthy of mentioning in your book would be the fear of everlasting condemnation due to some religious indoctrination in the past.
<br>
<br>
I was a born again Christian who converted my entire family in the not too distant past.  Once I started to have my OBE's a few years ago, this completely changed my way of thinking.  I ended up breaking away from the church and my lifestyle (looking like a fallen backslider), but that didn't stop my family (and sometimes past thoughts) to enter my mind, trying to convince me that Astral Projection was only leading me down the path to hell.   Fortunately, I am a strong person and I try not to be swayed by these alternate points of view, but I have talked to many others who are literally tormented by these thoughts (ex. Am I doing something bad?  I don't want to go to hell for this. etc.).
<br>
<br>
If you need anything else for your book, I'd be more than happy to help.
<br>

<br>
Keep smiling,

<section>
My worst fears come from ignorance, i.e., having something happen to me (most of my experiences are spontaneous) and not knowing what is going on.
<br>
<br>
Guideposts would be a big help.  For instance, if someone KNOWs there is a good possibility that they will experience paralysis, loud noises, odd hypnogogic imagery, the dweller on the threshold, "negs", possible guides, etc., then the fear of the unknown will be tempered a bit.
<br>
<br>
Also important is to emphasize how CREATIVE our minds are and how they will literally create situations for us that meet our deepest expectations.  A lot of the "work" we need to do for the sake of Astral Travel must take place in the here-and-now, in "boring" mundane reality.

These are all great!  Keep them coming.
<br>
<br>
All of these so far I've covered or thought of covering, but in some cases I thought they might not be perfectly legitimate "fears" and was considering leaving a few out.  Your feedback has impressed me to cover them.  Definitely.
<br>
<br>
The trouble I find with addressing fears too thoroughly is that I'm concerned that I might be giving people more to think about/worry about than they might otherwise have had.  I had that experience the first time I read AD a few years ago.  That experience of, "Well, I *wasn't* afraid of that...  But I am now!"

Laying out fears for people, without giving them the tools to overcome them, would definitely be irresponsible.  The goal is for people to feel empowered after they're done reading your chapter on fears.  So test it on a few strangers before you publish it!

Tisha,
<br>
<br>
The chapter isn't on fears but how to overcome them.  The focus is on practical, hard-nosed techniques for addressing, mitigating or even eliminating fears.  I just didn't want to leaving anything out, hence my request to hear what people find intimidating about OBE.
<br>

It's putting your faith in the unknown.  It's giving up control.

When I start to disassociate/fall away from my body, I freak out, grab onto my body as hard as I can, and partially come out of trance.

The idea the title conveys is that the tools for mastering astral projection are contained within.  The second part of the title, "A 90-Guide to an Out-of-body Experience" specifies the goal of the program, to achieve an conscious exit projection in 90 days' time.

I think you should address the question of motivation and overcoming the fear of the unknown. The few obe experiences I have had were not of great quality, however i felt no great fear, but I feel there is some quality of the unknown that I am trying to grasp.Sometimes when i am about to project i reach a state that I realize i don't know enough about where I want to  go that I abort-maybe this is fear of the unknown. This may be somewhat subconcious so I am still trying to figure it out. Someone suggested to contact your guides/higher self and ask for direction before doing an obe, this has helped somewhat.
<br>
Maybe saying something about the benefits of obe would help people's motivation, cause in AD there was really no answer to the question-why do astral travel?

<section>
Brian,
<br>
Here's my input on fears ...
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHANGING of BELIEFS affecting RELATIONSHIPS:
<br>
- What is the REAL long-term impact that OBEs will have on my relationship with my wife and immediate family?
<br>
<br>
To be straightforward, we're Christians and, as some of you know, Christianity has specific beliefs on eternal life, what it's like, who is and isn't there, how to get there, etc.
<br>
<br>
My personal spiritual experiences with God/Jesus have helped to form *some* of my beliefs (baptism was an INTERESTING one).  Likewise, my OBEs have lead me to re-evaluate some of what I believe and why.  I'm keeping an open mind and as I encounter more and more Astrally, I will naturally continue this re-evaluation and formation.  I'm very curious and want to know what's really REAL when it comes to Reality.
<br>
<br>
I remember hearing a saying, "How do you eat an Elephant? ... one bite at a time."  For those of you that have had a family member AFRAID of the consequences (their *ideas*) of OBE's, how have you handled this?  My wife is OK with my doing OBEs, she's not sure if it's good or bad AND has expressed fear of what it will do to our marriage.  How do you handle this?!?!?  Not talk about it at all ... talk about it freely ... feed them the elephant one bite at a time?  There are some Elephant bites, that I think she won't want to eat ...
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>
