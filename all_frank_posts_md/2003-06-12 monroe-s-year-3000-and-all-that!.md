<section>
I finished readng Monroes' second book Far Journeys, highly recommended, with lots of interesting ideas!
<br>
<br>
I was wondering what people thought of the part about 'The Gathering' which was dealing with a supposed event which is to happen around a thousand years from now, our time.
<br>
Monroe described beings arriving from all over the place to 'watch the big event' as it were, there's even a flying saucer there!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the crux of it is, that there will be some kind of 'cosmic ray' re-alignment around the year 3000 which will have dramatic efects on anyone still on the planet. Apparantly, Monroe was told that this will definatly happen, the only question is what effect it will have.
<br>
Either it will transform humanity, turning them into 'superhumans' and making the earth an 'upgraded learning centre' rather than what we have now. If this happens then the earth school will outshine many (or maybe all) other 'learning centres' (physical civilisations) in the material universe, of which there are countless numbers apparantly.
<br>
The other option is that it will have a devastating effect, basically finishing off humanity as a biological species, in which case the project will have to be started off again on some other planet.
<br>
<br>
What does everyone think of this scenario?
<br>
<br>
I just can't help be a bit sceptical about this, I left my scepticism at the door when reading Monroe's material and I agree with almost all of his findings, but I just can't help but have a problem with this, even although I want to believe it!
<br>
<br>
The problem is that I have always been sceptical about 'cosmic ray scenarios' which come along and transform humanity overnight and solves everyone's problems, it just sounds a bit to 'new age', it just doesnt seem right. It sounds like wish fulfilment. Much more likely in my view is a long slooooooow steady progression taking hundreds, or even thousands of years, maybe more.
<br>
Not as exciting I agree but a hell of a lot more realistic.
<br>
<br>
Do you think that this is a likely event then? I don't doubt that Monroe was told this, he was just reporting what he was told. However, perhaps the beings, 'inspecs' as he called them, wanted to feed him this scenario for their own reasons, perhaps as a learning tool or whatever.
<br>
<br>
a euro for your thoughts!

Sounds like Mr Monroe is 988 years out if the Mayans are to be believed, they say the same sort of alignment will happen in 2012. This page has some basics on the mayan callendar and links to more info.

hmm,
<br>
yeah, I still think that Monroe's vision was some kind of learning scenario, it just doesnt seem very likely, especially given the past history of our world!

I think Monroe would not have suddenly switched from being calmly analytical to crazy in the space of a few pages. Perhaps he was being shown a different Earth-like physical reality system and he didn't realise it.
<br>
<br>
I've read about this Mayan calendar and how it ends in year 2012 or whenever. But that kind of doomsday talk has come and gone for God knows how long. There will be a time when 2012 has long-since passed and all the "Mayan" talk will be forgotten. Does anyone remember the Millenium Bug?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps, though, that is not a fair comparison as the latter became known generally throughout the world. Who knows about the Mayan calendar outside these kinds of circles? Err, no-one.

Hi there folks !
<br>
<br>
I too was struggling with a few things Monroe said in his books. Not specifically with his learnings during his travels... but I found it a little hard to swallow when he claimed to have tripped on some concrete stairs, only to fall into a cushion of air instead of breaking his skull open !!
<br>
<br>
Re. the year 3000 event, I guess I would concur with Frank's view. True, it could be a learning scenario, but Monroe didn't record it as such... I'm making an assumption here that he could actually tell the difference between a physical reality system, and a learning scenario.
<br>
<br>
This raises another issue, I'm assuming that there is a difference between the two ??!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm digressing now. If we accept the idea that there are countless realities / dimensions, and not just the one we are familiar with, and that they are all as "real" as each other, then Monroe's account may well be true.
<br>
<br>
Often when we consider multiple realities we imagine them as seperate entities or fields. E.g. A collection of DVDs on a shelf represent distinct realities, each following their own story line.
<br>
<br>
Instead of seeing dimensions as seperate, perhaps multiple realities actually overlap each other, like currents in a river.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats my euro's worth Douglas, sorry its a bit garbled !
