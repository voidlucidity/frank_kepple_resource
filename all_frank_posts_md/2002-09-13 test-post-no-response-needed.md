This is a test of the emergency posting system.  In the event that this was a real emergency, please DUCK. NOW, back to our regularly scheduled program!
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I'm just testing out the POST DELETION possibility!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Delete the post and post again under the original heading and that'll bump up your post-count by one. Rinse and repeat for an hour or two and, hey presto, instant Gold status. Which means then you get paid for your posts.
<br>
<br>
But you'll have to be quick, they only need another 3 applicants.
