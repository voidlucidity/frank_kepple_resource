Hi. A couple of nights ago I was falling asleep and I started feeling tingling/vibrations on my body. I must have played around with this feeling because suddenly it felt like an event horizon opened and I was going somewhere else. I was scared but went with it. I must have blacked out.
<br>
<br>
Next thing I know I was travelling through a succession of places on different worlds, finally ending up travelling through space seeing stars and other amazing sights.
<br>
<br>
Then i'm in my bed!
<br>
<br>
I'd like to think this was a projection but the skeptic in me wonders if this was a dream about me projecting. Because I love the idea of flying through space and it would be the 1st thing i'd do out of body.
<br>
<br>
I've had a lucid dream before where I was floating through my house, but afterwards I realised things were different to reality which gave it away
<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on how to seperate a possible projection from dreaming?

Seems to be a projection to me. May have been in the astral planes. At any rate a dream is an unaware projection.
<br>
<br>
If in a dream you are in a higher body than real-time. Just focus on your real-time body and sort of grab onto it, and roll to the side or move and you can separate into real-time from a dream/astral experience.

Please post your experiences on the Group Efforts thread. As of this posting we are in week Two. This would be more powerful for you and everyone involved, and we'll all grow faster.

most important thing is to be aware and keep your awareness then you can do anything and break out of dreams. Â once you know you are dreaming all you do is start observing the things around ie the texture/colour etc.. knowing it's fake eventually what will happen everything will disappear/shutdown and you will see through your closed eyelids and just slowly walk out and you will be out, now maintaining awareness so you don't fall back to another dream or wakeup thats something else you have to work on by being aware all day that helps it carries onto sleep.

What you describe are the very beginning stages of the awakening process. Suddenly you find yourself with a degree of realisation but with little control. Hopefully your curiosity will be engaged to the point where it will lead you further.
