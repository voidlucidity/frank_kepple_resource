There have been many time that I have tried to return to my body and reconnect, so to speak, with it. It never works. It seems like when I leave my body there is an allotted time that must past before I can reenter my body again.                                                                                                    I have heard of this so called silver cord. I have never seen one. In fact I have never seen anything that connected me to my body. Most of the time when I leave my body I can see it laying there on my bed asleep. But, there have been times that i have awoke into OBE and been on my bed and not seen my body at all. I suppose this would constitute for entering another dimension?                                                                                            My big "Q" is why can't we reconnect with our bodies when we want? If our souls are only fitted to our bodies, then why can't we enter back into it when we want? I have had times that I actually thought I had died because I tried and tried to get back into my body and couldn't. Has anyone else had this problem? What are your theories about this?

Ha ha, yes, it's amazing people spend all that time trying to get "out" then they complain when they can't get "in". Why bother trying? Stay out and enjoy yourself, revel in it.

MT is, of course, quite right. You are engaging in a belief construct. There is no actual "in or "out" these are objective translations of the experience. You are never actually out of anywhere, so there is no getting

to struggle with. You are already where you want to be at any moment. Simply realise that and that's how it will become for you.

I know what you mean, Dagalvyi, mostly from my twin dreaming practices. I have been ejected many times when I tried to take the twin position. This has the same feeling of suddenly slipping into a "deeper trance." One of my limbs jump out (mostly my arm) or without any conscious effort from my part, a force will simply push me out. It is not a belief construct, or at least not more than eating is, because I've ejected many times, even at my first when I expected reconnection.

It happens after the brain has slip into a deeper sleep. Highly synchronous activity of the cortical neurons (delta sleep) makes the brain a very unfriendly place for cognition. It locks out the brain associated energy field in which our personality actually resides. When you reach delta sleep separation happens automatically and you can't reconnect.

Because twin dreaming is a very good practice that not only able to stabilize your projection (take the position in F22 then slip inside to reach deeper sleep), but it could also teach you layered and simultaneous dreaming, that is, using two or more dream body at the same time. Also, sometimes, when you take the wrong position or lay back in the opposite direction, it may let you to wake up in a parallel F22 where your other incarnations or probable selves dream.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this. Unless you are saying that we actually do not leave our bodies. If that is the case, then I have to disagree. 50% of my experiences start with me actually getting up out of bed/body. Sometimes I think I am awake until something weird happens. For instance, a few weeks ago I went into the living room and noticed wall hangings I never saw before. So, I realized I was still asleep, physically. When things like this happen I usually just fly out the closest window. I just don't understand how we could see our physical, leave it, experience things that are so real that my memory of it is just as clear as my physical memories, but yet not really be out of my body. Unless I am misinterpreting what you are saying?  TY!

I have no personal experience with it, but I seem to remember a section in astral dynamics about this.  The idea is that your physical body has fallen deeply asleep and you're locked out until it wakes up a bit.

I would love to have that happen to me!  I am out and I always black out and find myself back in my body within a short time.  You have a gift!

TY Mark! At first I thought I thought I had some sort of evil curse put on me. As I get older I realize that I am blessed. I thank GOD for letting have such a gift. I hope that everyone that wants to, will master this gift too.                             Happy Astraling!
