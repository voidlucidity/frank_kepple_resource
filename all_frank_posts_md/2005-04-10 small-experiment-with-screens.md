<section>
Last night, I started seeing "screens".  At the time, I was convinced I was totally awake, because I was incredibly lucid.  However, this morning (and in the cold light of day) I believe I was fast asleep and dreaming.  My lucidity was focused on the screens, and not on how conscious I was.
<br>
<br>
The first image I saw was a computer.  Actually, come to think of it, it looked like my laptop.  I was so aware of what was happening that I was very hesitant in moving my "eyes" to look at the image, for fear it might disappear.  I observed it for a while, and then when I was sure it wasn't going to fade away, I started moving my inner eyes.  The computer stayed and I remember thinking to myself, "this computer looks a bit old fashioned, and it's black – that's unusual."  (My laptop is black so I don't know why I thought that.)

<br>
<br>
I decided to try an experiment.  Very slowly, I put my hand into the image and onto the keyboard.  And there it was, large as life and looking very real!  I pulled it out and it went.
<br>
<br>
Just as I was about to get obsessed with putting my hand in and out for the next three hours, the image disappeared and another one appeared.  This was a wall; I think it was an interior wallpapered wall.  I don't remember what happened, if anything, between the first and second image.  I had one of those fleeting thoughts, "why am I getting really boring screens, like walls – when other people get beautiful landscapes?"
<br>
<br>
Then I put my hand into the image and wondered what would happen if I touched the wall.  What happened was NOT what I expected to happen – my hand went through the wall, as if I was having an OBE.  It was
<u>
 utterly
</u>
fascinating watching this, probably because of my level of awareness and control over the screens.  Once my hand went into and through the wall, I could no longer see it; just my arm remained.  I played with this for a while (I was totally transfixed – if a herd of elephants had come past me, I don't think I'd have noticed!) until the wall disappeared.
<br>
<br>
Then another wall appeared.  Cor blimey, what is it with walls?  I looked at it for some time and put both hands in.  This time, much to my surprise, the wall was solid and my hands couldn't go through.  I pushed them into the wall (this works when OBE, the wall "gives"), but the wall wasn't pliant.
<br>
<br>
Then I must have lost lucidity, because my boss walked into the bedroom (so I obviously fell into a dream).
<br>
<br>
I have to say, it's another small step in the direction I want to go, albeit a very teeny weeny step!!

<br>
<br>
LOL, I wonder that sometimes too, and somehow I learnt to appreciate the experiences even when I'm in an empty room and can't get out. You can always look for something else, a magazine, a different object, or explore your physical possibilities (like floating, shooting light or electric beams), things tend to show up.

I dont get anything yet, either im staring into 2d blackness or in an obe.  No in between things.  Is this unnatural?  Everyone I hear talking about obe's tends to experience 3d blackness or hypnagogic images before they leave the body, but I havent once.  Any ideas??

<section>
Have you tried thinking beautiful landscapes? Maybe the reason some people get these is because thats what they THINK is supposed to be there? Maybe since this was your first time you had no idea what was supposed to be there, so nothing was!
<br>
<br>
Or, perhaps just wait for the screen to turn into an image you like and hop on in!
<br>
<br>
Cheers, Ben

Ha ha, I thought your "boss" walking into your bedroom was quite significant. He must have his eyes on you, lol.

Selski, what you describe sounds like a wonderful experience! Who knows, perhaps you will go from lucid dreaming right into OBE. I would be interested in any updates on your experiences.

Kool!  Can I ask you; when you were putting your hand threw the PC could you feel the layers of what you were going threw? It is hard to explain. I had an experience once that I was going threw a wall. I could feel the wall layers as I passed threw it. So, I am wondering if you felt the same but with a different material. Also, I have had an experience that I was watching a TV type screen and different pictures of things were being shown to me. It was weird! I saw plane crashes, forest fires, volcano's and earthquakes on this screen. What exactly were your pictures?

Hi Dagalvyi
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your response.
<br>
<br>
Well, this one is hard to explain.  In my traditional OBEs, I know exactly what you are talking about, because I spend A LOT of time pushing my hands/body through walls, and I get so fascinated with this sensation that I forget everything else
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
<br>
And yes, I feel everything.  I've had different sensations though.  At times, my hand (for example) feels like it's experiencing an electric shock while it goes through a wall.  Other times it's more like pushing your hand through jelly, where you have to push a little more before it "gives".  And another time, it felt like a sort of "dddddddddddddddddd" sound and vibration as the hand went through.  I've explored this to death, so I feel very qualified to answer!!!
<br>
<br>
Now, the screens I mention are
<u>
 completely
</u>
different to having OBEs, or projecting.  They are just like your TV type screen experiences, where you are aware that you are lying in bed (or wherever) but you are watching something going on in your head/mind.  You are also aware that you are "connected" somehow to this screen in that if you put yourself in the image, you will be there.  It's almost impossible to explain, but I think you know what I mean.  So when I put my hand into the computer screen, it obviously wasn't my physical hand, but I had no conscious thought as to what hand it was.  I just did it.  And it amazed me.  I couldn't feel what my hand went through, it was simply there.  However, when I started putting my hand through the wall, I did experience the same sensation of "dddddddddddddddddd" that I feel with OBEs, which surprised me somewhat, because I thought the experiences were not connected.
<br>
<br>
My pictures exactly were as I described - a computer keyboard and screen (picture 1), a wall (picture 2) and another wall (picture 3).
<br>
<br>
I have experienced screens before which have been marginally more exciting than this batch!
<br>
<br>
I think they are something to be worked on - and I just need to understand how to make them happen, rather than have them happen to me

Hope at least some of this makes sense
