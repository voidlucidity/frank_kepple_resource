The end off all of the Mayan calander's end on that same date, so it must be something. The end of the world? Probably not. I'm 23 years old and I've lived through about 20 "ends of the world" already. There really isn't anyway to know until it gets here. I guess you can't really ask for more in this life than to see the end of the world though, right? That way you're sure you didn't miss anything.

OK, after that intial question, I'll provide a bit more info. My recent inquiry into the nature of the Mayan Calender and 12/23/2012 is that the Mayan Calender has periods or ages; the last one ended in 1987, and the next one begins in 2012. This in-between period is called Armageddon, or 'The Revealing.' I used to think 2012 was going to be the end of the world too, but deeper probing revealed that it's more like a time of major change, a 'Golden Age.' After this discovery, I sought to hear what others thought about this, hence the purpose of the initial post here.
<br>
<br>
As I understand it, Armageddon in the true meaning is not a bad thing, or the end of all, but more like a rollover period. Another interesting note is the mechanics of the Mayan Calender and the 13:20 ratio. The Mayan timepiece is based on the natural cycle of the moon, whereas the Gregorian calendar with the 12:60 ratio is illogical.
<br>
<br>
Now, any thoughts? =)

<section>
The calender is based on cycles of time that reveal a divine purpose. The calender's cycles are used by a being to make the most of the energy delivered by the rhythm of time.
<br>
<br>
Time is mistakenly thought of as a measurement by the majority. So, the majority are not in flow with time and its purpose-filled rhythms.
<br>
<br>
As you have stated, there is no "end" or "beginning" (unless for the relative measurement of a period) but "change after change" - or the dynamic ever-changing moment.
<br>
<br>
What you will see is the ascending of thought forms of the consenus of earth and the human collective. As you may know, anything you cleanse goes through a period of detoxification.
<br>
<br>
If you are in flow with time, you will know what is occuring.

Dear Bitsmart,
<br>
<br>
I definitely do not think it is the end of the world.  The little glimpse (view) I have had of the future took me to my daughters future apartment (20 years from now) there were still many of the same commodities in 20 years that we have now.  I do not know what type of art will be popular though... it is hard to say because my daughter like me seems to be a minimalist.  Not big into fancy decorating just plain, simple but what she did have was very nice...especially her computer.  If you saw my house you would understand the humour in this.
<br>
<br>
I think the change will be in consciousness.  My feeling is that mankind will be forced to realize that thoughts are things. As people start picking up more and more on others thoughts and feelings it will be those that have learned self mastery, humility, self respect and respect for others that will be well liked.  People will become more and more aware of the subtle ways in which they are being controlled by others (the insincerity of some people) and many will start breaking free of these bonds.  A very positive look at the future...yes.  However, for others it will not be so positive.  Those that insist on controlling and manipulating and those that decide to stay in a victum role will not only experience this negative environment more intensely but they well even 'see' to their horror the product of this type of thought pattern, more intensely.
<br>
<br>
Change will be the only constant but will ensure that people undergo some of the greatest spiritual growths ever.  Even right now our parents wonder how we handle such constant and relentless change in technology and learning....we will wonder the same of our children.  It will only get more not less.  The great thing about constant change is that it provides that little extra something that brings things to the surface so we can not hide them from others or much more importantly we can not hide them from ourselves. External change forces internal change.
<br>
<br>
Love and Light to the One and All,
<br>
Violet

<section>
Heh, that's what I was looking for. I'm aware of all that has been said here and now we can open this up to discussion. So, this is a very exciting time to be alive. This 'detoxification period' will have its high points and its low points, so the important thing for all of us to do is listen to our hearts, not so-called governing bodies. Some truths will be disclosed that have been kept secret for decades, and it will be hard to discern what is true. The saying 'everything you know is WRONG' will be appropriate in a short time.
<br>
<br>
Some may feel scared, but if this happens have trust in the Divine Plan and live a life motivated by love, not fear.

I have read that on December 23rd, 2012 a wave of energy (a border crossing) will pass through our solar system on its routine cycle and a large % of the human race will cross this border and step onto a higher plane of existance as the border crossing swoops through the Earth.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I have read is that on December 23rd, 2012 a cluster of comets that passes close to Earths orbit every 3600 yrs will impact the Earth (because this time Earth will be in the way) the impacts could be large enough to wipe out life on the planet or cause large scale cataclism if we're lucky.

I know a little bit about this stuff, and I know that the Mayan calendar has been the most accurate calendar to date and quite a few people have predicted that it will happen. What will happen is our crossing over into the fourth dimension, christ consciousness, astral planes, or whatever else u want to call it. I've even read that this is what the the bible calls "heaven". I firmly believe it's happening, and I've found reason for all the recent events. I think that it's not just gonna be one day that it all happens, it'll probably be a slower, more gradual process from now til 2012. I think it could happen anytime in between. I could go on and on about this stuff, but i'll stop. Just in case anyone wants to know more i'll leave my email and AIM screen name.

Another thing I know is that anytime we make an advance in technology, we "devolve" a little. The ultimate technology is the external merkaba, and that would cause us to lose touch with our emotional bodies. Again, i could go into it and give examples, but only if you had an open mind. We need to stop relying on science and technology and realise that everything we need lies inside ourselves.

This is in response to MJ-12. Technology can devolve humans simply because it makes our lives easier, and deters us from looking to ourselves for answers. Insetad, we look to outside sources. get it?

<section>
This is interesting....
<br>
First I agree that technology makes it easier to slack, and therefore gives little impetus for spiritual development. I also think it quite likely that there is a golden age coming, have had a few confimations of my own (prophetic dreams etc). But I do not think that the next 10 years will be easy, not at all (OK I admit I am a conspiracy theorist nut, but eg go read
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.almartinraw.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.almartinraw.com
</a>
)
<br>
The date mentioned, 23rd december, is quite significant for me because a little while ago I was attempting telepathic communication with my gran who passed away a little while ago, and asked for some significant dates. I don't have access to what I wrote down at the moment but I am pretty damn sure it was december 23rd, or 27th. Another one which I am less sure about could well have been february the 12 (feb = 2nd month, ie 2-12...and I wasn't listening for years at the time, just dates). So reading these posts kinda made me go "whoa!". But if I am wrong about the dates, I will find out in 2 weeks, and admit it.

Ha, another conspiracy theorist. I'm reading 'Rule by Secrecy' by Jim Marrs right now, it focuses on secret societies like Illuminati, Masons, and Skull and Bones and how it ties into everything.
<br>
<br>
The next 10 years will not be easy, as this is Armageddon ('The Revealing') but it will turn out OK in the end (12/23/2012).

Yes, there can be a positive use of advanced technology, but only after humans realize that we need to turn back to our spiritual ways. We can use technology to help us to look within ourselves by actually using some sort of brain implant. Technology mostly just separates us from ourselves and you can plainly see that we have lost touch with God. Technology causes us to act as individuals, rather than as a race.

<section>
I think some advances in technology are quite exciting, such as new energy sources, nano technology, and new scientific healing modalities. I think they could definitely be part of a new golden age. But they could exist just as strongly in a dark age. It's all in our individual attitudes. All of those things could be used positively or negatively, it all depends on the mindset of our governments (or perhaps some lone genius will discover cold fusion, then it's his mindset, but normally, the governments are the ones who have the people that are going to make these technological breakthroughs), and in a place where the people have a voice, their mindsets also. I just feel that the new golden age will be a melting pot of new spiritual awakenings spreading through the majority of the populous, new technologies, and perhaps some out side source helping us along (an energy wave, aliens, Mother Nature, magic returning to the Earth (that's from Shadowrun), etcetera). But the main thing has to be a change in the mindset of the majority of the people, because without that, we'll just have a world filled with better weapons. MJ-12, the only technology you mentioned that I don't like is the manipulation of the human genome, that feels "wrong" to me. Nature has a plan, and that's screwing with it, even if it means that babies will still be born with birth defects, I think it's worth it not go there, because they'll never stop at that. It'll be like Gattaca.  Ben

Well said Goku. You made me remember something I read in an interview with Drunvalo Melchizedek (sp?). He said he we in contact with the government, and they were allowing him to use a device to clean up the earth. He says this small device (which runs off of a 9v battery) can clean the pollution in a major city overnight. He believes that after people see how beautiful it becomes, people's attitudes will begin changing with it. The actual device supposedly contains tiny coils of sacred geometry. I know this sounds a little far-fetched, but I think Drunvalo is a very trustworthy source, so we'll just hafta see.

I found the article interesting, but it was way too negative. People always seem to associate Armageddon with death and destruction, when in fact it's going to be the most beautiful thing any of us has ever experienced. It's not going to be easy to get there, there's going to be chaos, but we will unite.

Technology doesnt make our race act as individuals. There will always be groups of friends, and in times, big groups of people act together. If you think about it, you can sort of blame Religion on both seperating and joining people. I dont hate muslims or anything, i have 2 muslim friends, but arent muslims susposed to make the whole world muslim with a revolt?

w/ reguard to the natural evolving process... we are the only species on the planet to be able to have cracked the genome. the n atural selection process was bound to happen. i was thinking that this was wrong in a way too until one of my friends pointed out that we evolved to that point. as humans we can only evolve so far w/out the use of technology. we are not where we could be w/out the use of technology but, if we were at that point, then would the next step be? it's possible that cracking the genome is natural and everthing is following as it should. i dont know where i stand on this but i think this is a good point that hasnt been brought up yet on a  good topic.

As people start picking up more and more on others thoughts and feelings it will be those that have learned self mastery, humility, self respect and respect for others that will be well liked.  People will become more and more aware of the subtle ways in which they are being controlled by others (the insincerity of some people) and many will start breaking free of these bonds.

<section>
these are great debates. i think the most interesting one raised here is the is science progressive or destructive. I havent made up my thus far. consider the progressive aspect of science we're using it now! the world is at your fingertips, also medcine people who design computers, teach, or make great contributions to mankind may have died 200 hundred years ago from influenza!
<br>
on the other hand science makes mankind greedy, lazy, selfish etc in so many ways.
<br>
<br>
do they balance each other out?

We were watching a video in history class that told us about this.  If the world does end then or anytime really, I wouldn't mind.  I would rather die with the whole world than have loved ones die while I'm still alive or die while loved ones are still alive.  That way, I won't have to grieve over the deaths or they wouldn't have to grieve over my death.  Ya know?

As with all things you can not have one with out the other.  Atomic power which gave birth to the Atom Bomb and the Nuclear Power Plant.  One a weapon of mass destruction and the other a form of cheap clean energy with limited depletion of natural resources.  The automobile which has allowed us to expand our who world, we can go further, faster, but we create things like smog and acid rain by doing so.
<br>
Even in resposible hands technology is dangerous.  Science does, has, and will continue to bring the human race closer to thier dreams.  The good ones and the bad ones.

Balance in all things.

lysear: i must disagree with you when you say "on the other hand science makes mankind greedy, lazy, selfish etc in so many ways". mankind has always had greedy, lazy, selfish, and such people. science has merely given them more ways to be greedy, lazy, selfish, etc. but science has also given the good people of the world more ways to be helpful, cooperative, healing, etc.
<br>
<br>
science is a tool, and as the saying goes, "Don't blame the tools".

<br>
The Mayan Calendar - The World Will Not End
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; CARLOS BARRIOS was born into a Spanish family on El Altiplano, the
<br>
&gt; highlands of Guatemala. His home was in Huehuetenango, also the
<br>
&gt; dwelling place of the Maya Mam tribe. With other Maya and other indigenous tradition keepers, the Mam carry part of the old ways on Turtle Island North America). They are keepers of time, authorities on remarkable calendars that are ancient, elegant and relevant.
<br>
&gt; Mr. Barrios is a historian, an anthropologist and investigator. After studying with traditional elders for 25 years since the age of 19, he has also became a Mayan Ajq'ij, a ceremonial priest and spiritual guide, Eagle Clan.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
Years ago, along with his brother, Gerardo, Carlos initiated an
<br>
&gt; investigation into the different Mayan calendars. He studied with many teachers. He says his brother Gerardo interviewed nearly 600 traditional Mayan elders to widen their scope of knowledge.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; "Anthropologists visit the temple sites," Mr. Barrios says, "and read the steles and inscriptions and make up stories about the Maya, but they do not read the signs correctly. It's just their imagination... Other people write about prophecy in the name of the Maya. They say that the world will end in December 2012. The Mayan elders are angry with this. The world will not end. It will be transformed. The indigenous have the calendars, and know how to accurately interpret it, not others."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; The Mayan Calendars comprehension of time, seasons, and cycles has proven itself to be vast and sophisticated. The Maya understand 17 different  calendars, some of them charting time accurately over a span of more than ten million years. The calendar that has steadily drawn global attention since 1987 is called the Tzolk'in or Cholq'ij. Devised ages ago and based  on the cycle of the Pleiades, it is still held as sacred. With the indigenous calendars, native people have kept track of important turning points in history. For example, the daykeepers who study the calendars identified an important day in the year One Reed, Ce Acatal, as it was called by the Mexicans. That was the day when an important ancestor was prophesied to return, "coming like a butterfly." In the western calendar, the One Reed date correlates to Easter Sunday, April 21, 1519 the day that Hernando Cortez and his fleet of 11 Spanish galleons arrived from the East
<br>
&gt; at what is today called Vera Cruz, Mexico.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; When the Spanish ships came toward shore, native people were waiting and watching to see how it would go. The billowing sails of the ships did indeed remind the scouts of butterflies skimming the ocean surface. In this manner was a new era initiated, an era they had anticipated through their calendars. The Maya termed the new era the Nine Bolomtikus, or nine Hells of 52 years each. As the nine cycles unfolded, land and freedom were taken from the native people. Disease and disrespect dominated. What began with the arrival of Cortez, lasted until August 16, 1987 - a date many people recall as Harmonic Convergence. Millions of people took advantage of that date to make ceremony in sacred sites, praying for a smooth transition
<br>
&gt; to a new era, the World of the Fifth Sun.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; From that 1987 date until now, Mr. Barrios says, we have been in a time when the right arm of the materialistic world is disappearing, slowly but inexorably. We are at the cusp of the era when peace begins, and people live in harmony with Mother Earth. We are no longer in the World of the Fourth Sun, but we are not yet in the World of the Fifth Sun. This is the time in-between, the time of transition.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; As we pass through transition there is a colossal, global convergence of environmental destruction, social chaos, war, and ongoing Earth changes.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; All this, Mr. Barrios says, was foreseen via the simple, spiral mathematics of the Mayan calendars. "It will change," Mr. Barrios observes. "Everything will change." He said Mayan Daykeepers view the Dec. 21, 2012 date as a rebirth, the start of the World of the Fifth Sun. It will be the start of a  new era resulting from and signified by the solar meridian crossing the galactic equator, and the earth aligning itself with the center of the galaxy. At sunrise on December 21, 2012 for the first time in 26,000 years the Sun rises to conjunct the intersection of the Milky Way and the plane of the ecliptic. This cosmic cross is considered to be an embodiment of the Sacred Tree, The Tree of Life, a tree remembered in all the world's spiritual traditions. Some observers say this alignment with the heart of
<br>
&gt; the galaxy in 2012 will open a channel for cosmic energy to flow through the earth, cleansing it and all that dwells upon it, raising all to a higher level of vibration.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; This process has already begun, Mr. Barrios suggested. &gt;
<br>
&gt; "Change is accelerating now, and it will continue to accelerate." If the people of the earth can get to this 2012 date in good shape, without having destroyed too much of the Earth, Mr. Barrios said, we will rise to a new, higher level.  But to get there we must transform enormously powerful forces that seek to block the way.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; A Picture of the Road Ahead
<br>
&gt; From his understanding of the Mayan tradition and the calendars, Mr. Barrios offered a picture of where we are at and what may lie on the road ahead: The date specified in the calendar Winter Solstice in the year 2012 does not mark the end of the world. Many outside people writing about the Mayan calendar sensationalize this date, but they do not know. The ones who know are the indigenous elders who are entrusted with keeping the tradition.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; "Humanity will continue," he contends, "but in a different way.  Material structures will change. From this we will have the opportunity to be more human." We are living in the most important era of the Mayan calendars and prophecies. All the prophecies of the world, all the traditions, are converging now. There is no time for games. The spiritual ideal of this era is action. Many powerful souls have reincarnated in this era, with a lot of power. This is true on both sides, the light and the dark. High magic is at work on both sides.  Things will change, but it is up to the people
<br>
&gt; how difficult or easy it is for the changes to come about. The economy now is a fiction. The first five-year stretch of transition from August 1987 to August 1992 was the  beginning of the destruction of the material world. We have progressed ten years deeper into the transition phase by now, and many of the so-called
<br>
&gt; sources of financial stability are in fact hollow. The banks are weak. This is a delicate moment for them. They could crash globally if we don't pay attention. If the banks crash ... then we will
<br>
&gt; be forced to rely on the land and our skills. The monetary systems will be in chaos, and we must then rely on our direct relationship with the Earth for our food and shelter. The North and South Poles are both breaking up.
<br>
&gt; The level of the water in the oceans is going to rise. But at the same time land in the ocean, especially near Cuba, is also going to rise.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; A Call for Fusion
<br>
&gt; As he met with audiences in Santa Fe, Mr. Barrios told a story about the most recent Mayan New Year ceremonies in Guatemala. He said that one respected Mam elder, who lives all year in a solitary mountain cave, journeyed to Chichicastenango to speak with the people at the ceremony. The elder delivered a simple, direct message. He called for human beings to come together in support of life and light. Right now each person and group is going his or her own way. The elder of the mountains said there is hope if the people of the light can come together and unite in some way.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Reflecting on this, Mr. Barrios explained: "We live in a world of polarity:
<br>
&gt; day and night, man and woman, positive and negative. Light and darkness need each other. They are a balance. Just now the dark side is very strong, and very clear about what they want. They have their vision and their priorities clearly held, and also their hierarchy. They are working in many ways so that we will be unable to connect with the spiral Fifth World in 2012."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; "On the light side everyone thinks they are the most important, that their own understandings, or their group's understandings, are the key. There's a diversity of cultures and opinions, so there is competition, diffusion, and no single focus."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; As Mr. Barrios sees it, the dark side works to block fusion through denial and materialism. It also works to destroy those who are working with the light to get the Earth to a higher level. They like the energy of the old, declining Fourth World, the materialism. They do not want it to change.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; They do not want fusion. They want to stay at this level, and are afraid of  the next level.  The dark power of the declining Fourth World cannot be destroyed or overpowered. It's too strong and clear for that, and that is the wrong  strategy. The dark can only be transformed when confronted with simplicity and open-heartedness. This is what leads to fusion, a key concept for the World of the Fifth Sun.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Mr. Barrios said the emerging era of the Fifth Sun will call attention to a much-overlooked element. Whereas the four traditional elements of earth, air, fire and water have dominated various epochs in the past, there will be a fifth element to reckon with in the time of the Fifth Sun: ether.  The dictionary defines ether as the rarefied element of the Heavens. Ether is a medium. It permeates all space and transmits waves of energy in a wide range of frequencies, from cell phones to human auras. What is "ethereal" is related to the regions beyond earth: the heavens.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Ether the element of the Fifth Sun is celestial and lacking in material substance, but is no less real than wood, stone or flesh. "Within the context of ether there can be a fusion of the polarities," Mr. Barrios  said. "No more darkness or light in the people, but an uplifted fusion. But  right now the realm of darkness is not interested in this. They are organized to block it. They seek to unbalance the Earth and its environment so we will be unready for the alignment in 2012. We need to  work together for peace, and balance with the other side. We need to take care of the Earth that feeds and shelters us. We need to put our entire mind and heart
<br>
&gt; into pursuing unity and fusion now, to confront the other side and preserve life."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; To be Ready for this Moment in History Mr. Barrios told his audiences in Santa Fe that we are at a critical moment of world history. "We are disturbed," he said. "We can't play anymore. Our planet can be renewed or ravaged. Now is the time to awaken and take action."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; "Everyone is needed. You are not here for no reason. Everyone who is here now has an important purpose. This is a hard, but a special time. We have the opportunity for growth, but we must be ready for this moment in history."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Mr. Barrios offered a number of suggestions to help people walk in balance through the years ahead. "The prophesied changes are going to happen," he said "but our attitude and actions determine how harsh or mild they are."
<br>
&gt; We need to act, to make changes, and to elect people to represent us who understand and who will take political action to respect the earth.
<br>
&gt; Meditation and spiritual practice are good, but also action. It's very important to be clear about who you are, and also about your relation to the Earth.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Develop yourself according to your own tradition and the call of your heart. But remember to respect differences, and strive for unity. Eat wisely. A lot of food is corrupt in either subtle or gross ways. Pay attention to what you are taking into your body. Learn to preserve food, and to conserve energy.  Learn some good breathing techniques, so you have mastery of your breath.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Be clear. Follow a tradition with great roots. It is not important what tradition, your heart will tell you, but it must have great roots. We live in a world of energy. An important task at this time is to learn to sense or see the energy of everyone and everything: people, plants, animals. This becomes increasingly important as we draw close to the World of the Fifth  Sun, for it is associated with the element ether - the realm where energy lives and weaves.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; Go to the sacred places of the earth to pray for peace, and have respect for the Earth which gives us our food, clothing, and shelter. We need to reactivate the energy of these sacred places. That is our work.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; According to Mr. Barrios' reading of the Mayan calendar, if war happens in November 2002 or after, then it's bad, but not catastrophic. But if it happens between April and November 2003, it will be catastrophic. Really bad. It could eventually result in the death of two-thirds of humanity. "So stay active," he said. "If we are active, we can transform the planet. The elders watch to see what happens." Many Mayan elders and knowledge keepers may be eliminated in the next few years. For the first half of the current Katun (20-year period) the dark side has a lot of power. But that will pass
<br>
&gt; 3 to 4 years from now. The tide can turn. Amazing things are going to happen.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; One simple but effective prayer technique is to light a white or baby-blue colored candle. Think a moment in peace. Speak your intention to the flame and send the light of it on to the leaders who have the power to make war or peace.
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; We Have Work to Do
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; According to Mr. Barrios this is a crucially important moment for humanity, and for earth. Each person is important. If you have incarnated into this era, you have spiritual work to do balancing the planet. He said the elders have opened the doors so that other races can come to the Mayan world to receive the tradition. The Maya have long appreciated and respected that there are other colors, other races, and other spiritual systems. "They know," he said, "that the destiny of the Mayan world is related to the destiny of the whole world."
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; "The greatest wisdom is in simplicity," Mr. Barrios advised before leaving Santa Fe. "Love, respect, tolerance, sharing, gratitude, forgiveness.  It's not complex or elaborate. The real knowledge is free. It's encoded in your DNA. All you need is within you. Great teachers have said that from the beginning. Find your heart, and you will find your way."

  I think the change will be in consciousness.  My feeling is that mankind will be forced to realize that thoughts are things. As people start picking up more and more on others thoughts and feelings it will be those that have learned self mastery, humility, self respect and respect for others that will be well liked.  People will become more and more aware of the subtle ways in which they are being controlled by others (the insincerity of some people) and many will start breaking free of these bonds.  A very positive look at the future...yes.  However, for others it will not be so positive.  Those that insist on controlling and manipulating and those that decide to stay in a victum role will not only experience this negative environment more intensely but they well even 'see' to their horror the product of this type of thought pattern, more intensely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Change will be the only constant but will ensure that people undergo some of the greatest spiritual growths ever.  Even right now our parents wonder how we handle such constant and relentless change in technology and learning....we will wonder the same of our children.  It will only get more not less.  The great thing about constant change is that it provides that little extra something that brings things to the surface so we can not hide them from others or much more importantly we can not hide them from ourselves. External change forces internal change.

<br>
Most likely, people will misinterpret the events that lead to these changes as they did around the year 1000.  More specifically, they will attempt to match spiritual signs with material objects.  Most of the time, this promotes misunderstanding(s).
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Since 1413 we have been in the 5th post-Atlantean period.  This period will last 2,160 years and will end in the year 3573.
</b>
Hence we are really at the beginnning of our period, and in its course a great deal will happen through the development of spiritual science.  All this, however, can only reveal itself gradually, step by step.

Yeah I think a lot of people misinterpret the 2012 "prophecy"  If it is true, it doesn't mean the end as in death, but the end of the current WAY of life (in a good way).  Basically it will be when Earth acends to the 5th dimension and all sorts of information that supposedly has been hidden from us will be revealed.  Ex: 45 books from the Bible, entire sections from the Declaration of Independence...
<br>
Also supposedly the Sun is changing from Hydrogen to Helium which will make nuclear weapons duds and Xenon gas will start forming in our atmosphere which will supposedly give us back a lot of our abilities we once had.
<br>
<br>
It would be nice... but who knows if it's all true.  Guess we just live life to fullest till then, and then we'll see what happens!

   I read about this date in history....  Supposed to be the end of the world, and the Mayans havent been wrong yet.
   <br>
   <br>
   It actually scares me to know this information.  It correlates exactly to my friend's "big bang" theory that the universe is reborn every thousands of years or so.  That scares me more.

<section>
I think what is happening is a deep cleansing of the earth. About six-nine months ago, I was asking a lot of question of myself about the future, the New World Order, terrorism, etc. and I had two dreams that answered some of my questions (well, my personal relation to these issues).
<br>
<br>
The first was, I was standing on a balcony - and I was looking down on the earth. It was a deep red, and I could not see the continents. There was this incredibly deep and powerful feeling that was present, like a very deep feeling of anger, but impersonal. Now, this was the earth, but it I was also like I was looking down on myself.
<br>
<br>
Then my vision 'zoomed' into one part of the earth (which was myself as well) and I could see an oil rig being destroyed - there were explosions ripping through it, and people lost their lives, but that didn't seem to be important. It was like a parasite was being eradicated (which was happening to me as well).
<br>
<br>
This dream communicated to me that the earth is being cleansed on a very deep level at the moment, and I feel that I am very strongly affected by this cleansing (obviously, because I'm being cleansed as well). I feel that in my life, I am undergoing a transformation, but I cannot put my finger on it - it's happening to every part of my being.
<br>
<br>
The second dream, I think, communicated to me a warning - that danger will enter my life when I don't expect it - the only warning will be a feeling of, 'ohh... that doesn't look too good..'.  Like the first dream, it was very symbolic, there wasn't that vividness that a lot people here talk about in their visions.
<br>
<br>
I think a lot of crazy things will come to pass in the next 10 years, but this conflict in the world at the moment must deepen before we progress. I personally see terrorists as a blessing - because I think they will destroy parts of this world that need to be destroyed, otherwise the path we go down would be into complete darkness, fear and control.
<br>
<br>
My view of technology is that it doesn't matter what level of technology we have access to, but rather the spitirual advancement of the people whom have access to it.

In my oppinion, i think that some technology does render us from progressing in one part of our existance.... but Isn't it odd how something else in our lives just happen to make a change in our life to 'make' us learn that part of our life that was once before hindered?  There are also technologies that can help us raise our spiritual existances from the depths one may have sunk to... I think that things will even out one wa yor another... notice how these prophocies are stateing that we will hit an age of enlightenment from were we are.... notice how were we are, just so happeneds to be a day and age were money, and technologies govern our societies? Things will clear up... Just don't lose sight, and always keep an open mind to things. With this, nomatter what kindof life a person lives, they'll eventually raise in existance.

the date isnt set, it could fluctuate as to what day and even what year, since it's so late in the year. i've heard everything from february to december. the orbit of nibiru can fluctuate just as a comet, or just as earth does. 2012/2013 is just a good guess based on all the prophecies/calenders/myths/biblical code/etc. i'd say the mayans are going to be most accurate though [

<section>
i have seen just as meaning readings of people living in the future as i have prophecies about everyone dying. i think this supports the theory that not everyone will die from whatever may happen.
<br>
<br>
on sightings, a medium similar to john edwards read three people at the same time in the same room. she saw too of them as old men, living and working in what she described as underwater chambers.. possibly small underwater cities. she could not, however, see the third person's, or at least that far into that person's future. when i saw this it interested me, because they were all young, healthy people, and were all being read at the same time, looking into the same date in the 2040/2050's. there's always the possibility of an automobile accident, drowning, etc., but for me this helped confirm my belief that only most of the people on earth will die. 1/3 to 2/3 is the figure often offered. it wasn't as much as the 3rd person had no future as it was the underwater installations.
<br>
<br>
after a catastrophic event, such as a comet/asteroid or contamination of water, underwater installations wouldn't be so far-fetched. ie, in the case of a comet, the land would become soaked and unfertile, there would be mass extinction of animals. we would have to rely on continental plant life and ocean life for our food. we would have to rely on desalinization plants, as well, to extract the salt from ocean water. in case of water contamination, we would also need water-purifying plants.

On December the 21st, 2012 we will pass into the 5th dimension which is the etherical/astral plane. Our consciousness will be able to travel vast distances among other things. At the moment we live in the 4th dimension which i think is time.

It has been said that this date is the end of the world but I think this is highly unlike. If anything is gonna happen, it will be something good. Hey even if we are all gonna die then it will still be good coz we all die together!

In this entire forum, there is a common topic... a fifth demintion, or altered conciousness.  There is talk of spiritual people leaving and others being left behind.  Questions are being asked, such as "why would spirtual people leave, when the good is just beginning?".  But, is the good beginning, or is the good being disguised by something else?          I am from the Christian faith, and believe in 1 true God.  I believe in creation, and also the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  I believe that God has a plan for his people (believers and followers of Jesus Christ, his Son).  In the Bible, God promises the return of His son(Jesus).  In this return, Jesus takes all the Christians to heaven (altered consiousness, or the 5th dimension, possibly?).  The non-believers in Christ will be left on earth, apart from God, and all that is good.  After a period of time they, along with the devil, will be cast into the Lake of Fire for all eternity (Hell).  Do you people not realize that all of these things fit perfectly with the Mayan predictions?  Read the book of "Revelation" in the Bible, and you will see how it all ties together.  I urge you to read it, and maybe talk to an expert about it.  I am no expert by any means, but to me it is simple.  I love the Lord, and trust Him and his plan for my life.  It is blind faith, which is scary to people... but please, just check it out, and see if it impacts your life in any way.

God Bless,

<section>
Let me be clear about this, the maya existed long before christ, their prophecies, their astronomy and mathmatics were well beyond in relation to our own current status, any average means.
<br>
The bible is a book, written not by one person, but by many, translated and missinterpreted many times, and always individually interpreted(Which is the most important way to interpret it). It is a good book, not one for which I myself believe wholly in because it should be obvious to the reader, although I am not criticizing anyones take on it, that only parts of it could be true or closest to that, and many other parts are not to be taken as literally, as they are symbolic personally/emotionally/eventfully/spiritually.
<br>
If you feel the need to put "blind faith" into such a religion as christianity, go into it without any misconceptions about what religion itself actually is. It is not spirituality, and it is not about being close to god, it is about massing together and following guidelines/rules that man has placed before us in place of god. Spirituality is a personal thing, that can be found at times through religion, or through other means.
<br>
You tell people to read the bible, but the book isnt the answer, its yourself that holds the answer. What you need to do is not just read the bible, but other bibles as well, from the Qua'ran(Koran), to the Bhagavid-gita, and the mormon bible, to the satanic bible and the Urantia Book.
<br>
Don't ever limit yourself when it comes to spirituality, because although you may hold the same beliefs you have now, you can also find for yourself different paths to follow in the same light.
<br>
The mayan prophecies does not "fit" with revelations, revelations and many many MANY other religious myths/prophecies/legends/truths/stories fit with each other and the mayan prophecy.
<br>
Chronology isnt even important when it comes to this subject, but realize, that christianity was in no way a new concept, just a new form of that concept.
<br>
Jesus, like Pacal Votan, helped his people and became more than human. Many different opinions on these subjects, so I'll try to make the rest brief.
<br>
Faith in yourself is one thing, blind faith is another. It is not scary, it is absurd.
<br>
<br>
I hope you realize that your belief does matter, but don't let that confuse you with the truth....and there are many.

<section>
Im sorry, but I dont consider Christianity as a religion... religion is not what I was looking for when I became a Christian.  Christianity is a daily walk and relationship with Jesus Christ.  I believe wholly in the Bible.  I do not believe at all in the other books you mentioned, because I believe in one true God, not many gods.  I realize that the Mayan writings were long before the Bible was written, but there were also over 400 prophecies about the coming of Christ written hundreds of years before he came.  Every one of these prophecies were fulfilled... But one.  The prophesy of Jesus' return to take his people into Heaven (and cast all others, regardless of how "good" they are or what good deeds they have done, into Hell).  My God is a selfish God, but also a very loving God.  He cares about everyones needs, and he has left one way to get to him.  And that way is through Jesus Christ's death on the cross.  I believe that it is the only way to Heaven, or paradise...and all others will soon realize this.     If I have offended any of your "religions", then I am sorry, but this is my sole belief, and no others will be accepted by me.

<section>
Im not going to make this a debate, there is no need to apologize, I was not offended. I am not religious, I study religions, spirituality, and the human factor.
<br>
Believe what you will, thats fine, but dont confuse the prophecies here. Every walk of life had their own, and all were very different but very similar.
<br>
Im sorry, you may have beliefs similar to christianity, but to call yourself a christian is to relegate your postition as one who is religious. Christianity is a religion, not much you can do of that. The belief in the book, the prophecies, church, affiliation and all the rules that apply; if you are involved with this, you are involved with a religion. Now if you read the bible, believe in it and christ, but do not go to church then you are believer but not christian.
<br>
Theres nothing wrong with that. If you think you must call yourself Christian in order to get into heaven, then that is where I will debate.
<br>
If you call yourself a Christian but do not consider yourself religious then those are your own personal terms for your beliefs and not any others.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The only point I was trying to make, is that religions are all the same. If you see one over the others as having more pertinence to your life then that is probably what you were meant to believe for certain reasons.
<br>
If you are going to debate about religions not being similar get ready for a long long long discussion with someone who does know what they are talking about.
<br>
My knowledge doesnt just come from a desire to know these things, it comes from a pull, whether fate, god, the universe, whatever you may deem it, I followed my path for reasons just as you have yours, this doesnt make me any less special nor you, but know that because you were raised one way or decided to go one way because it felt right, good, but never attempt a theological argument about the only religion you have made apparent to want to know with someone who makes attempts at every angle to know as much as possible about the subject beyond the topic. That entire sentence I wrote was completly pointless, and I can admit to my faults and laugh at them and accept them..hehe (giggle giggle).
<br>
<br>
I hope I have not offended you, or tried to come off as more competent, that was not my meaning, I just become passionate about these topics because of how much involvement I have had with many ideas of beliefs, and it is difficult at times to restrain myself.
<br>
<br>
My final thought though, just because I learn about all these things and try to research them and put my entire being into them, does not mean I don't have my own belief. These things I do strengthen the bond with my belief, as I believe it does with everyone when they can see from all sides of the spectrum rather than the one they refuse to let go of. Yours is your own...

J_K40,
<br>
<br>
Firstly, welcome to the Astral Pulse Forum.
<br>
<br>
As a new member I would like to pass on to you one piece of advise with regards to individual beliefs -
<b>
 please do not evangelise your beliefs here by trying to force others to accept them as the one and only true way.
</b>
This forum does NOT tolerate religious evangelism, be it Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Pagan, whatever.
<br>
<br>
If Christianity is your belief, as it is also the belief of many others on this site who also follow the path of Jesus, then that is fine. We respect your beliefs, your rights to your choice of beliefs and your spiritual path. We would ask that you also respect the beliefs of others who have not chosen christianity as their spiritual path.
<br>
<br>
As long as you are not intent on denouncing the beliefs of others, and you are able to speak from your own heart and your own belies rather than just quoting doctrine, your perspectives are welcome here.
<br>
<br>
With that in mind, sit back, relax and enjoy the conversations.[

 Jesus takes all the Christians to heaven (altered consiousness, or the 5th dimension, possibly?). The non-believers in Christ will be left on earth, apart from God, and all that is good. After a period of time they, along with the devil, will be cast into the Lake of Fire for all eternity (Hell).
</i>
<br>
<br>
I just love it!
<br>
btw the 'mayan prophesy' as it is portrayed is in no way related to the christian scenario. For a start there is nothing about 'non believers' burning in hell, or indeed any kind of mass-death. This is all fantasy and is also the influence of, may I say it, Christian apocalyptic mythology; that is, you are trying to view other traditions through the lens of christian mythology, which leads to all this nonsense, including all the recent crap about 'demon wars' etc, which have absolutly nothing to do with Mayan tradition, but plenty to do with Christianity.
<br>
<br>
<br>
To my point:
<br>
You know, I recognise that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs but the constant harping on about various 'doomsday' scenarios really gets on my t**s, mainly because thats all Ive heard for the past 10 years+!!
<br>
<br>
First it was Nostradamus and July 1999, which everyone had 'good' evidence, whats more it was even 'backed up' from other non-related 'traditions',
<br>
then we had the millenium crap, even when it turned out that due to a re-arangement of the calender, the millenium had already passed sometime around 1996 our time!
<br>
<br>
I was hoping for some sanity after 2000 and a hope... just a single glimmer of hope, that maybe, just maybe, once people had went through all that without any of it happening, then they LEARN not to be obsessed with all these kinds of 'revelations'.
<br>
<br>
But no, now its '2012' and we have to endure another 8 years of this stuff. In the past i would have said that i was looking forward to 2013 when (of course) nothing will have happened, but I now know that by that time, excuses will have been given and attention will have been transfered to some all new great prophesy. Add to that a whole new generation eager for their own 'doomsday' prophesy to call their very own, (which is what this mayan one is actually), and the rest of us basically have no respite.
<br>
<br>
btw, I would just ask that some of you who are into this 2012 stuff might want to check out some of the fact (proper facts!) about this as I have read in some academic journals that this whole thing has come about through a complete mistranslation and distortion of the original texts which in reality mean nothing of the sort.
<br>
Hoevever, now that the story is out there, it has taken on a life of its own, promoted by money grabbing new age writers and credulous readers.
<br>
<br>
I am in no way saying that this is the case IMV, so dont hit me with complaints about this opinion. I don't know either way. I just want to point out to people that there is actually a controvesy about this whole issue and people who are interested might want to check out the facts and not just rely on 'mayan prophesy websites' or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Above all, I would just like to invite all readers to remember this post in 9 years time when they wake up on the 1st January 2013 and find that they have NOT been elevated to a higher vibrationary level or whatever the theory is.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.
<br>
Goodnight.
<br>

I just think that people who like to come up with these prophecies came acroos this Mayan calendar thing and used it to back up yet another doomsday type prophecy.
<br>
<br>
Here is mine: In 2050 all of the ice on the north and southpole will have disappeared as can be proven with some very difficult scientific calculations. This means Santa will not have a home anymore and will be very ticked off. Now everyone knows that Santa is some sort of divine being because he can travel around the world in one night and deliver gifts to every household using his flying sled and reindeer. After melting his ice, Santa will use his powers to end our world as we know it.
<br>
<br>
This is my doomsday prophecy so let's start the discussions and the terror!

]For anyone who reads thess..fear not. The Mayans may have a very accurate calender, but who are they to tell us what is going to happen in our life time, I belive in Jesus Christ, and ot everyone who knows abotu him, then u know that there will be a rapture, where God takes all of his belivers on Earth and save them from evil forever! NO ONE knows when this will takes place.  Trust in God, pray and read the bible, attend church and u will find hope.  In God all things a possible. I am a religous guy, So i am saying to everyone who reads this that Dec 23, 2012, could just be another day, and if it is Gods will, then anything that happens on that day will be for his purpose, and trust me, His purpose if the best!
<br>
<br>
God Bless Everyone

i did some research and i believe that the day is the 21st, not the 23rd (sorry cindy!) because the calendar ends on the winter solstis at 10:24 AM. Also, the Mayans never really said the world would end. In my opinion i believe its more of that we are going to move into a "golden age." Im also pretty big on the Nibiru stuff so thats what i believe is going to happen, but thats just my opinion...

and lets not forget that an equinox is supposedly in the mix during the 21st of december on the solstice as well.
<br>
The planets aligning in across the milky way at a 45 degree angle I believe it is and the sun in the center at a certain point in time. If anyone has any extra info on that or more precise info be my guest.
<br>
This crossing alignment is seen as the birth of the tree of life to the Maya.
<br>
<br>
btw I am biking to Chitchen Itza and palenque tomorrow, should be to chitchen itza by the end of the day and palenque two or three days after that.
<br>
Im camping there and getting up early to watch the morning sun hit the temples, although it is not the harvest time of the year so Im not going to see the serpent rising upwards the steps to the top.
<br>
Anything weird happens (Winks) I'll let you all know.

i am going to laugh so hard when, 2012 passes by and nothing happens, and then people start BSing about how the mayans got it wrong and that it is actually 2020 or something and then that doesnt happen and people keep moving back the date.
<br>
<br>
well if something does happen, its coming from waco, texas. The place where the branch davidian thing happened. baylor university is a college in waco and they are planning on completing some big project in 2012. here is a link

Its the largerst military compound in the free world. really close to waco. Dr. peper, was created in waco, actually thats a good thing but i just had to through it in.  just a bunch of ironic stuff.
