For beings in the astral realm to follow you back to this realm and effect your life? I wake up almost every morning in the astral realm, I'm curious if what I see there can effect my life here. Lately every morning I see spiders, any clue to what that might mean?
<br>
Thanks, I appreciate any advice!

They crawl across the ceiling over to the bed then lower themselves down until they are just above my face and dangle there. It's odd because I'm wide awake with my eyes open, but I see them. I can pass my hands right through them.
<br>
I once had a fish do the same thing, it came through the wall, swam from one end of the room to the other then through the opposite wall. I thought maybe I was loosing it and going mad, but I know they aren't real (of this world) and that I'm just "seeing" them.
<br>
Is this astral projection? Usually when I would go astral, it would be in a trance type state, but this is when I'm completely awake.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It sounds like you are offering yourself a typical F1/F2 overlay experience. This is where your primary focus is Focus 1, i.e. the physical, but over that you superimpose images from your areas of individual consciousness that is Focus 2 (of the Phasing model of consciousness). A lot of artists do this naturally. They can overlay the image they want to draw, paint, model (or whatever) onto the blank paper, canvas or whatever it is they are modelling with. So to them they are just duplicating physically what they can already see as an F2 overlay.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hi Frank,
<br>
Thanks so much for the reply. Overlaying images makes sense, I wondered if it might be some kind of merging of different realms. I'm curious if it might peak at times when one is using their creative senses more, as I am doing right now while trying to start a business.
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
Crystal
