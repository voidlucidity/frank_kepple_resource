The same way you move your arm. Its automatic for me (but harder).

after i do my relaxation exercises i begin to run energy(i use NEW). after 5-10 minutes of full body sweeps i run a couple of sweeps through the major chakras. by this point my whole body will be humming. the time it takes varies from day to day but with practice it gets easier to achieve.
