Hi Tao,
<br>
<br>
I practice by concentrating on my heartbeats. The point is to let the body fall asleep while I stay awake, and forget about my body completely (which is basically the key element of all techniques).
<br>
<br>
I most of the time lose my concentration however, and my mind wanders in something else. Or I have these blank (unconscious) moments where I fall asleep for a moment. When I wake up again a few seconds later, it is with a jolt and I'm completely aware of my body again.
<br>
<br>
So some more practice, I guess...
<br>

hey eeb,
<br>
how do you concentrate on your heart? I've tried before but i can never feel it pumping. Im sure that if i was able to hear/feel it then i would be able to concentrate on it. Any suggestions&gt;?

Hey timmerdog,
<br>
<br>
I concentrate on the feeling of my heartbeats. I use to practice laying in my bed; my bedroom is on the first floor, so when I am there laying in my bed, I have gone up the stairs and it's not a problem to feel my heart beating. Once I caught the beat I don't lose it anymore. It becomes softer with time and relaxing ofcourse, but if I focus on it and look for it, I refind it again without problem.
<br>
<br>
You also can feel it ofcourse[

]! You don't have to detect precisely the pumping-feeling. If you relax, you will feel your heart throb; with every beat it makes, you can feel it almost whereever you want in the body. To get technical: with every heartbeat there is an increase in pressure in your arteries/veins throughout your body. This means a change of pressure, and changes are the things your senses perceive!
<br>
<br>
If you have difficulties I recommend you to just jump up and down or something that makes your heart beat faster, till your heart increases beat-frequency and you start to breathe faster. Then lay down and start to focus.
<br>

There is a search function which you may find useful. Also, a number of people here have read the book Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce. Both of which should get you up to speed fairly quickly.

<section>
Thanks for the replys.
<br>
Yes I know about Astral-Dynamics book - and i am using it, sorry if this topic already exists - i`ve thought about that.. but i`ve never used the search option (i missed it)..
<br>
The reason for this topic was not only to initiate me - i thought it would be usefull to know what technique is using everybody..
<br>
Well.. thanks again Frank - but your reply was a little offtopic - could you tell me what technique are you using anyway ! I mean thank for the tips.. but i was really intersted in your reply - but you didn`t said what technique you`re using.. I read on a topic about you Frank that you keep all your answears in folders - so when someone asks an ordinary question you can answear it faster- so I think this was an ordinary question

Hi Timmerdog,
<br>
<br>
To aid focusing on the heart take several long deep breaths. Breathe in for a count of ? (whatever you can manage) , hold in for half that. Breath out for the same time as the inhale, hold out for half that. After repeating this two or three times you should be able to feel your heart beating noticeably.
<br>
