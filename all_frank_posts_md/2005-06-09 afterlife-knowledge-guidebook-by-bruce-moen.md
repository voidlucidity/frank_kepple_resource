I thought I would throw this question to the board for those who have read Bruce Moens recent book Afterlife knowledge guidebook.
<br>
<br>
Would you consider this one of the best sources published on phasing at the moment?
<br>
<br>
Does this book have good exercises to lead you through the focus 10 through 12 states and beyond?
<br>
<br>
Any opinion at all on this book or his exercises is welcomed.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.
<br>
<br>

Hi Jeff,
<br>
<br>
There was a long thread on Bruce Moen that has since been moved to our

forum. You may find that reading through that thread may answer some questions and possibly raise others. You can access that thread if you

Hey Nick,
<br>
<br>
That thread you gave me was fantastic.  I think I had searched it but never read the entirety of it.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to receiving his book.  I didn't grab the audio cd's as I don't have the funds as a student at the moment but I will diligently work through the exercises.
<br>
<br>
Since its been a number of years since you received the book and went through the workshop how did your experiences shape up with his work?  Have you moved on?  Or holistically put together other phasers knowledge?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Cannot comment on that particular book of his as I've never read it. But regarding his exercises, yes. I have read about his work in other books. He is not actually Phasing. Well, not in accordance with the Phasing Model of consciousness that is. His work is based on what he calls his Focused Attention concept. In terms of my Phasing Model, he would be teaching people how to achieve an F1/F3 overlay experience. Which, in a sense, you could say is a little easier as you are not making a full "switch".
<br>
<br>
One of the ways in which Bruce's Focused Attention concept is similar to the Phasing Model is in the way he uses the imagination to get things underway. From memory Bruce calls this "priming the pump". The Phasing Model uses a person's faculty of imagination to create a mental rundown that they "step into" in other words they make The Switch from Focus 1 into Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
What Bruce is doing is rather than seeking to make The Switch to Focus 2, he skirts around that and looks to remaining within F1 primarily, but to overlay that, in the mind, with an experience of F3 using the imagination as a kind of primer or kickstarter. Quite a nifty technique that does certainly work as I've researched it myself. But at the end of the day, even though it is a little trickier, there is nothing like fully "stepping into" the area proper, IMO. But if you are looking for a straightforward, non mystical approach then it's certainly one worth considering. Has been tried and tested too as this is the approach Bruce teaches in his seminars.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Jeff,
<br>
<br>
The Afterlife workshop I attended was in February of this year, perhaps you were looking at my start date as member which was a few years ago.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
The workshop followed the book and audio cds though. I did find the weekend workshop to be a completely worthwhile experience and would recommend it to anyone.
<br>
<br>
What I have been doing the last few years is to work on
<i>
 phasing
</i>
. I first learned of it here at the AP from the posts by Frank which I began reading after I joined this forum.
<br>
<br>
As Frank describes above, there are some differences between Bruce Moen's
<i>
 focused attention
</i>
and
<i>
 phasing
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I do fully respect what Bruce Moen is doing, and I believe that
<i>
 retrievals
</i>
are a very worthwhile, helpful endeavor. At present though, I find myself continuing along with the
<i>
 phasing
</i>
approach that Frank has been teaching here. It has brought me the most success of anything that I've worked on so far.
<br>
<br>
In any event, I am a full believer in reading and learning all that you can. That said, I would certainly recommend Bruce's book.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick

Thanks Nick and Frank
<br>
<br>
Appreciate the feedback.  You have cleared that up for me.  Unfortunately I should have posted this before purchasing the book
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.  Don't get me wrong I am sure the book is great read anyhow but I guess I thought Bruce was doing a phasing thing like Frank.  I was just looking for some food to tie me over before Franks book.  hehe.  Typical impatient me.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow I will probably keep reading Franks back posts as they are starting to make more sense for myself now.  Franks phasing model is truly what I want to stick with for now and I have uncovered some posts today that really helped clear some ideas up.
<br>
<br>
Thanks guys.
<br>
