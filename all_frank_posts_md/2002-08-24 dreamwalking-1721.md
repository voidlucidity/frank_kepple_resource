Hi all, I don't post here very often, but I do read some posts here every so often. I have a quesiton for you guys. Have you ever tried Dreamwalking? How does it work? A friend and I would love to do a shared dreaming experiance and I think this is the way to go.
<br>
<br>
Any links, advice, stories would be grand.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
