<section>
Today I thought I was having my second OBE but think it was really a lucid dream.
<br>
<br>
I was having a couple of short dreams where I tried to force myself to ask my self the question if this was a
<br>
dream when In the dream state. I drifted back into a dream where I was laying in the floor and tried to sleep
<br>
but for some reason Students came into my room and looked into my aquarium. I first faked that I was sleeping but reveled myself
<br>
after a while. One girl said asked me why I had fishes and turtles in the same aquarium since the fishes was eating on the turtles.
<br>
I was also startled by this and wondered who had messed with it, I then realized that this wan´t even the same size as mine.
<br>
I think it was here that I realized that I was dreaming and excused myself. I ran out and to the front door and thought that I should try to
<br>
levitate up to make my astral body rise and initiate an OBE. I raised through the roof but found myself back to the bed and began to rise
<br>
from it instead. I found myself hovering above my bed but like the last time I couldn't´t see.
<br>
I said something like "I wan´t to see" but nothing happened. I tried instead if I could see anything through the void.
<br>
I suddenly found myself in a classroom I think, I flew out into the hallway and could see some female students lined up outside.
<br>
They could see me and I walked up to the and gave one girl a hug and a kiss.
<br>
It felt as though I could do whatever I wanted.
<br>
I then flew out through the schoolhouse and found it to be winter outside, I didn't´t think this was odd since I had heard
<br>
that the real-timezone could have reality fluctuations.
<br>
I then tried to fly over the city, I thought I couldn't´t really gain altitude so I concentrated harder. I then
<br>
Realized that I had jet rocket boosters on my arms and legs and this gave me faster speed.
<br>
But I suddenly became lost and found myself at apparently another city, the odd thing was that the name of the city
<br>
was engraved into the house I was standing in front of. I don´t know how but I managed to get back into my own city, I
<br>
thought I should visit my mum who lives just outside the city. When I got closer I thought the the size and configuration of the houses didn't´t add
<br>
up to what I remembered, I tried to fly back to the city and just as I left I saw some strange futuristic cars and thought
<br>
that maybe I was seeing the future. I then tried to get back to my house too see if it looked the same but this had also changed and
<br>
I got confused and the I waked up.
<br>
<br>
As soon as I waked up I thought that this couldn't´t have been an OBE since there was too many reality fluctuations.
<br>
<br>
- There is no school where I visited.
<br>
- First it was snow then It turned too summer but I didn't´t notice the change.
<br>
- I saw real people that I talked to and touched.
<br>
- I didn't´t thought that a name engraved into a building indicating which city I was in was strange
<br>
<br>
And the end of the dream where I tried to get back to my house but didn't´t exactly recognize the surroundings
<br>
When I now think about it It reminds me of the way to my hotel room in Turkey.
<br>
<br>
It is possible that the beginning was me hoovering above my bed although It didn't´t felt the same as the first time.
<br>
If my astral self was hoovering above I think It began too dream too when I tried to see.
<br>
So instead of opening my eyes I had a lucid dream about having an OBE
<br>
<br>
Does my theory sounds good?
<br>
Can the astral self dream too or was i never really conscious in astral form?

one of the first lessons to learn is that dreams, lucid dreams and obes are all THE SAME THING. The only difference is your level of conscious awareness. Aim to raise that and the sky's the limit!

I know there are alot of different of opinions out there regarding OBE´s and Lucid dreams. But I can´t say that I agree that they are all the same things. I´m waiting for the next real OBE (the first one I had was really short and I could´t see anything, and this one that I had I think was really a very conscious dream). Hopefully I will able to open my eyes next time, and then I hope It will be different then this "dream"

From my experience I think they are pretty close to the same thing.  I have had lucid dreams that seem like OBE's and visa versa.  However I can project from a lucid dream and it feels like my astral body is floating up from somewhere.
<br>
<br>
I figure a lucid dream is just an astral plane that you are on and with an OBE you generally project into the RTZ.

In my opinion, for what it's worth, I've come to the conclusion that they are
<i>
 very nearly
</i>
the same thing.  But not quite.
<br>
<br>
It's funny, because when I started having OBEs (my first was on 21 June 2003 - that's summer solstice isn't it
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
), I thought that they were the best thing since sliced bread.  I mean, to be able to wander around in some sort of second body and go off flying (or at least trying to) was just the bees knees.
<br>
<br>
I can very much understand folks who want to experience that - it
<u>
 is
</u>
the biggest thing that has happened in my life.  But that's circumstantial I suppose - I was always looking for "magic".  I wanted secret doorways and unknown adventures.  To be able to actually walk through a wall still astounds me - even now, nearly two years later.
<br>
<br>
These types of RTZ experiences seem more "real" - I can fully understand that.
<br>
<br>
Whereas my lucid dreams are just getting going, so to speak.  Because I've experienced a shedload of RTZ OBEs (and a few "astral" ones to boot), I am finding that my lucid dreams are more interesting - to me anyway.  I meet other characters who I'm convinced exist beyond me and I am able to interact with them.  This is much more exciting than spending my time pushing my hands through walls.
<br>
<br>
My OBEs and my lucid dreams have the same level of awareness - that is total consciousness at times - just like you have right now as you are reading this - and there are differences.  OBEs are lonesome, but you tend to be in familiar surroundings, which make you
<i>
 think
</i>
they are more real, whereas lucid dreams are less familiar, with characters you don't necessarily know, and if you are so inclined, you can pass them off as "just" dreams when you awake.  Of course, I don't do this.
<br>
<br>
My tuppence worth.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
We are now realising that people do their dreaming, lucid dreaming, basic astral projecting and a number of other things besides in the very SAME area of consciousness. Such that the only real differences between them all are your beliefs and your expectations regarding your experience.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
