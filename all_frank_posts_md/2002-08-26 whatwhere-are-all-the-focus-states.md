<section>
Hi Everyone,
<br>
The various FOCUS "states" have been discussed here quite frequently ... I am only mildly familiar with Focus 10 and 12 from reading Robert Monroe's 2nd book.
<br>
<br>
Is there a website or some reading material that DETAILS EACH FOCUS "state/locale" ... or could someone break them down for me and list the details of each?  For example, Frank has mentioned that F-27 is the true afterlife and that F24, F25 &amp; F26 are where the belief-system locales reside.  I'm interested in visiting the different Focus(es) and would like to know which are which.  Thank you!
<br>
<br>
Enquiring minds wanna know!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>
Greg Taylor

<br>
Main ones are:
<br>
<br>
F22: People suffering chemical dependency such as alchohol, i.e. being blind drunk; people suffering from delirium, or those who are otherwise comotose.
<br>
<br>
Prospects: reasonable to next-to-none (depending on Physical circumstances).
<br>
Power: very little to none.
<br>
Hope for the future: reasonable to next-to-none, depending on Physical circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<br>
F23: Dead but stuck close to RT zone. Could be for a number of reasons, for example: strong feelings of wanting to get revenge; confused suicide cases, etc. These people have normally suffered some *major* emotional trauma at the point of physical death. Like, being executed for a murder they didn't commit, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
Prospects: maybe get listed in the Physical as a ghost.
<br>
Power: limited to scaring people in the Physical who should really know better.
<br>
Hope for the future: very little (rescue is possible but highly dependent on age and circumstances).
<br>
<br>
<br>
F24, 25 &amp; 26: Dead, but when physical accepted various premises and concepts. These would normally include (but are in no way limited to) religious and philosophical beliefs: but who are entirely unaware that thought is a primary energy that creates their surrounding circumstances. Therefore, range of possible actions is limited to whatever are the acceptable range of actions within the adopted belief system (concensus reality, in other words).
<br>
<br>
Prospects: limited to "rising within the ranks" of the adopted belief-system.
<br>
Power: more or less, depending on belief-system position. But always restricted, ultimately, by overall constraints of belief system.
<br>
Hope for the future: mental realisation of limitations of belief-system leading to escape and/or rescue to F27 (highly dependent on age and circumstances).
<br>
<br>
<br>
F27: True afterlife region. Dead and aware (to a greater or lesser extent) that thought is a primary energy that creates your circumstances. In other words, people in this region are free to have all the fun they can muster, in whatever way, shape, or form they choose.
<br>
<br>
Prospects: unlimited.
<br>
Power: unlimited.
<br>
Hope for the future: unlimited.
<br>
<br>
<br>
HTH

Hi Frank,
<br>
Thank you for the explanations, that clarifies A LOT.

<br>
<br>
F22 - So, this contains physically alive people then.  Are those with chemical dependancies there, only when they're "under the influence" of the chemical?  What do you mean by "Blind Drunk"?
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_blush.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_blush.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
F24/25/26 - These are the various "heavens" of the various belief systems, then.  OK.
<br>
<br>
F27 - I'm gonna have to visit this one ... when I get some more OBE control and mental clarity.

<br>
<br>
I Just discovered (research ... not OBE) there's a F3, F15 and F21 ... what are these?

Blind Drunk is a colloquial term meaning being totally intoxicated, i.e. out of your box, completely mashed, etc. (I'm not sure what the equivalent north American colloquialisms are.)
<br>
<br>
There are introductory states that start from C1 which is ordinary Physical consciousness. But the obe stuff basically begins at F23 (I'm a bit pushed for time, at the moment, to explain the prelim states.)
<br>

<br>

Hi Frank,
<br>
Thanks for additional feedback!

<br>
<br>
"Blind Drunk" in my state (Michigan - USA) would be the equivilant of "Sloshed", "Totally Wasted" or "Knocked Out" ... also an older saying is "Three sheets to the wind!"

Apparently, I am missing something here ... the Forum states that Frank was the last one to post (prior to this one) on "27 August 2002  05:44:01" ... so where's his post?  There must be some "gremlins" messin' with the forum!

Thanks for the link ... the article is very thought provoking ... now I REALLY want to visit F-27!  I'm already imagining the possibilities!

Thanks for all your explanations of the Focus States.

I just found some more details on Focus States under the Gateway Voyage Program page on
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.monroeinstitute.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.monroeinstitute.org
</a>
<br>
<br>
Focus 10 - mind awake, body asleep
<br>
<br>
Focus 12 - expanded awareness
<br>
<br>
Focus 15 - no time
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 - other energy systems
<br>
<br>
Also, the Bruce Moen article (see clandestino post above) mentions the following:
<br>
<br>
Focus 34/35 - The Gathering:  Non-human intelligences from our physical universe, other universes and other dimensions ... are found here.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Yeah, I didn't mention The Gathering stuff because the Jury is still out on that one as far as I am concerned. Problem is, I've never actually projected within that region, so cannot really say if the place definitely exists or not. The only info I read about, to date, sounds a bit wacky. (Well, to me at any rate.)
<br>
<br>
It would be nice if I could make contact, as I'd love to review the kinds of technology they were using.

Hi Frank,
<br>
If/when you make contact at Focus 34/35, that would be very interesting to learn about your visits.
<br>
<br>
The other evening, I had a dream (perhaps an OBE) where I visited an alien "buddy" on his home world.  They were humanoid, from what I remember, and into high-tech.  We hung out at some eating place, cafeteria, chatting.  Then, the time came for sundown ... and they all went to sleep at the same time.  My alien "buddy" was inquiring me, as to why I wasn't preparing for sleep, as well.  After that point, I left, flying up into the air above the city.  Aparently this "race" enjoyed casinos for entertainment.  As I flew higher and higher, I reached a point far into orbit over their planet.  The surface was mostly water, with a large continent that was shaped like the "Nike Swoosh" (on tennis shoes).  There continent was so developed with real estate buildings, etc., that the continent resembled a large rough metalic formation, with various levels of formation on the surface.  Along one edge, the formations appeared almost spinal-column like.  Seeing the sun cresting over the planet surface was beautiful ....
<br>
<br>
Have you ever projected to a place like this?
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>
