How do you overcome the fear of leaving your body?  For me it is like an instinct to fear this state.  What do you think?  Is it just me?

All I can say is, you get used to it.  I struggled with fear while leaving the body for ages, and when I would get out I would be attacked by NE's and thrown back into my body.  I had a sever struggle with NE's and fear, but after a 1.5 year period I feel that the sensations from obe's are the most insane and awesome feelings anyone can feel.  I have grown rather fond of them.  If you ever have problems with NE's, just show them whos boss and get out of your body as much as possible.  The more effort they put in the sooner they give up, especially if you dont give them the satisfaction of fear, that is what they live for.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Instead of getting scared simply learn to laugh at it all. Don't take it too seriously. Look in the mirror and laugh at yourself. I don't know what it is about this topic that people think a humour bypass is a compulsory prerequisite. Taking it too seriously causes all manner of problems and eventually you can end up riding a ghost train that never ends.
<br>
<br>
People are also
<u>
 way too quick to judge
</u>
what is happening around them. They see something and instantly think it's potentially harmful. Even the slightest movement or a shadow or whatever, immediately they judge it to be harmful. So they get scared and then, because of the nature of the environment, everything starts going haywire. But if they would just laugh off whatever it was in the first place, there would be no problem.
<br>
<br>
The big hurdle everyone has to get over is the fact that within Focus 2 of consciousness (which is where most people do their projecting) everything that is normally
<i>
 within
</i>
yourself, while physical, becomes
<i>
 outside
</i>
of yourself. The whole setup reverses. What was once within is now without, and what was without before is now within. Problem is, people don't see themselves as being within their own mind. They think they have "travelled" to "astral realms" like they have gone to some separate place. But you're nothing of the kind. You are actually within your own mind engaged in the fulfilment of a belief construct called astral-travel.
<br>
<br>
So all those niggling little fears that you'd normally hold inside of you, while physical, are now on the
<u>
 outside
</u>
of you! So you can often end up meeting the objective manifestations of those fears face to face, as it were.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in the past, people have failed to understand the way your reality reverses. This is mainly because, as I say, they saw themselves as being in some kind of separate place (the Astral) rather than actually being within their own mind. When they came upon the objective manifestations of their fears, they saw these manifestations as being in some way "resident" within that place. Which is, after all, exactly how it looked.
<br>
<br>
So all kinds of ideas about devils and demons were created, which just makes the situation worse. This is because the more you subscribe to the notions of these constructs the more "real" they become for you. So you hold them in mind more... the very same mind that you are projecting within. So the more you hold them in mind, the more you meet up with them when you go there. And the more you meet up with them, the more you hold them in mind. So the more you hold them in mind, the more you meet up with them when you go there. That's why I say, you end up riding a ghost train that never ends.
<br>
<br>
But if you just laugh at it, hold laughter in mind, so to speak. When you project within, you meet all the objective manifestations of your laughter. In other words, you meet up with fun circumstances rather than the scary awful stuff many people create for themselves, but without realising it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Now that I think about it, in the past I have met negativity with pity and it has worked.  When I've done this I've realized that the situation wasn't as bad as I originally perceived it to be.
<br>
<br>
It is interesting what was said about taking things too seriously.  I have a tendency to do that but it never occurred to me that it could be my hang up here.
<br>
<br>
I've been having lucid dreams lately that have turned into what I think are OOBEs but I am considering trying to induce an OOBE on my own.  I really need to get over this fear thing before I attempt to do that!
<br>
<br>
Thanks!

I think it took me about a decade until I was truly fearless-It can be a very confusing state of conciousness to experience, it's so drastically different than our normal sense of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///reality.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 reality.It
</a>
seems that due to the "unkown" factor,it's absolutely possible to take it too seriously.Most,if not all of us have probably been guilty of this in the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///beginning.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 beginning.It
</a>
took me a long time,and a lot of experimenting to learn that there's literally nothing to be fearful of.
<br>
<br>
BTW-Franks' post was,as usual,incredibly lucid and enlightening.

Well Frank pretty much said it all so I can't contribute a whole lot...
<br>
<br>
You have lucid dreams you say?  I know this sounds kind of silly but like when I have a problem, astrally or physically, I kind of try to work on it in my lucid dreams.  Like I had this encounter with this really scare negative being(or it might of been a manifestation of my own) and I got scared.  So my next lucid dream(s) I shouted out, "I need to talk to my courage!"  And the first time this really nice dog came out.  And I told him, "okay we need to give you a workout and build up our courage."  So I started making him run back and forth and telling him to attack the negs, and just drilling him.
<br>
<br>
Works with anything really!  The next time I encountered something hostile in an OBE I ran right towards it without fear and it disappeared!

I get these INTENSE CRAZY LOUD vibrations whenever i dream.  Usually it is associated with dream paralysis.  I would be able to feel myself fully conscious and aware that i am unable to move.  I am feeling these vibrations at the same time.  I have no idea what's going on with me when i dream.  I don't understand it at all.  Most of the time i get really scared, and I put all my effort into getting out of that dream.
