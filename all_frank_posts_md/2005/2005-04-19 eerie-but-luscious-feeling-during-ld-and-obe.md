Many times when having an OBE but more especially during a Lucid dream scenario....I have had this ..what can only be described as a "luscious eeriness" sortof feelig when participating in the LD environment..Robert Monroe explains this by referrring to it as "Going Home"...which sort of makes sense.
<br>
The feeling that you are in your "real" (spiritual) home environment..the pathos and sort of obscure nostalgia is tremendous..
<br>
Anybody know what I am blethering onabout?or can desxcribe it bettr than i can?

Dunno, maybe it is that sense of being free from mortal concerns? I have thought should the roof fall in and leave me with no body to go back to that it wouldn't bother me too much, it's not like I'd have to cook to stay alive anymore or pay the gas bill. Â Wherever I am in a projection I tend not to feel out of place apart from RTZs, when I usually have a distinct feeling of not being home, of being neither fully 'there' nor 'here', interesting as it is.

Obscure nostalgia - I guess there is a kind of 'history' that you feel in what are generally called astral projections and lucid dreams, bit like walking into your local pub on a summer's evening having been away for some time. You don't have to do anything or say anything, and no one makes a fuss, but everything's normal. There's an undercurrent of things being in their place, god is in his heaven and all's right with the world type stuff, Smashy. It kind of runs effortlessly, doesn't it? No need for a Blair or local council. Thinking about it, that's one of the most appealling things about astral travel: Wherever you are, it seems to run itself free of charge

there's nothing to grumble about. hadn't looked at it quite that way till now. Astral travel is all about being free from beaurocratic madness... I'll go and sleep it off now..

While in dreams in general (in these I had control over myself as far as I can tell; they all have been lucid just to that point) I have a sense of peace, many with a false memory backstory are of returning to a familiar place I've known or of meeting people again after a long absence. They are nostalgic dreams, even if these are people that never existed, though most are of or include people I know.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It's hardly surprising people get these feelings as you are actually within your own individual areas of consciousness. The "astral" is a part of Focus 2 of consciousness and it is the area where most people do their dreaming, lucid dreaming and all manner of things besides. You are actually dwelling within your own imagination, your own family of belief constructs, you own sense of ideology, sense of being, etc., etc. Everything about this area pertains to the individual in question.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
