Hi,
<br>
<br>
I've finally found myself coming here and posting.  It took long enough is all i can say.
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
A short introduction... I just recently finished the Mastering Astral Projection workbook though I've been trying for many years off and on to successfully OBE.  I've had some successes though they still elude me.  Regardless I've had many spiritual insights from the path it's all taken me on and it's been well worth the trip.
<br>
<br>
If you want to know more about me feel free to PM or otherwise message me... or perhaps we'll just cross paths in the forums sometime!
<br>
<br>
Peace,
<br>
ZenTiger

Hello Zentiger
<br>
<br>
Nice name!
<br>
<br>
Welcome - spend some time looking around the getting to know the place - it's a minefield of information!
