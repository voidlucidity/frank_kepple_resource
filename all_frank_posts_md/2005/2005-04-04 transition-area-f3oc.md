<section>
I have a question about F3oC. I am currently rearranging my sleep schedule so that I get up after about 6 hrs of sleep and then try to do the phasing exercise Frank mentioned in his Phasing FAQ. This morning I was able to get up and write down my dreams and I saw some slight hypnagogic imagery before falling into the abyss of sleep. Tomorrow morning I am goin gto get up and try from my lazy boy in an attempt to stay more aware.
<br>
<br>
I have had quite a full lucid dreams, and I figure that if I fall asleep and have a lucid dream that I should try and reach F3oC from that dream. My question has to do with the nature of F3oC.
<br>
<br>
In Monroe terms, he described F27 (which is in F3oC of Frank's model) as feeling almost the same as the physical. I know that when I have a Lucid Dream, it is hard to keep remembering that I am dreaming and I either have to wake myself up in order to remember the dream or I go back to being non-lucid. If I convert a lucid dream to a F3oC experience, will I have to continual stay aware as in a lucid dream or is it more like physical awareness where I generally stay lucid without considerable effort?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The big problem with trying to do anything from a lucid dream (as I'm sure Doug aka Gandalf, will testify) is you can never really get the high level of awareness necessary to make full progress. It is far better to Phase from the physical direct to F3oC. This area is equivalent to the Monroe focus states F23; 24; 25; 26 &amp; 27. Basically, this covers the Transition Area as it is called.
<br>
<br>
Experiences in this area are extremely lucid and are not subject to anywhere near the kinds of fluctuations that are typically experienced within F2oC. Problem is, F2 is essentially your imagination. So anything you think automatically comes about all around you. This is darned inconvenient and confusing for a large majority of people. But it is perhaps the easiest non-physical state to Phase into, which is the plus side.
<br>
<br>
In terms of reliability in objective perception, F3 is the focus state to head for. The experiences to be had here are generally as stable and as clear as your physical experiences. Provided, of course, you can hold yourself in check. I mean, if you ran down your village high street shouting and swearing like a maniac then you are likely to meet with some opposition. :) Â In a sense the same applies with F3 experiences. Provided you can act as normal as you would while physical, then your surroundings will be very physical-like also.
<br>
<br>
Within F3 you are free to think basically what you like, and you don't get all your surroundings chopping and changing to suit. But still, if you start releasing lots of emotion then you will be subject to F2 overlay experiences (chances are). If you fail to check this right away, you will transition to F2.
<br>
<br>
I like F3, it was my favourite area but I'm now totally intrigued by F4. Thing is with F3 are the wide variety of experiences you can have. The lower branches are to be avoided in the beginning as these are typically the "hell" constructs. But get to F26 and F27 and you meet all manner of jolly characters all "dead and proud of it" as I call them.
<br>
<br>
Because the people on the top branches are so lucid, you can generally ask them about their physical lives and, now and again, you can get info you can check on. It's really amazing getting info you know nothing about. Then keying it into a search-engine and having the evidence come up before your very eyes!
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for the reply, Frank. I kind of expected the answer to be that converting an experience from a lucid dream will still involve the problems with remaining lucid, but I thought I'd ask anyway.
<br>
<br>
I will try to get there via direct phasing, and am assuming the way to do that is via the instructions in your phasing FAQ along with the setting of intention to skip past F2oC and head straight for F3oC.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again...

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Just want to make a small point here: when you say to go past F2oC, that's go past
<i>
 in a manner of speaking
</i>
. Or at least it should be. The 4 primary focus states are immeasurably entwined, so there is no need to go from one to the other. You probably realise this as I've mentioned it a number of times. But thought I'd mention it just to qualify for others who may develop a different understanding thinking they necessarily have to go from one to the next.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck in your attempts.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
