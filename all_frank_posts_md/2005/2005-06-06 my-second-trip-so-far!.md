<section>
It's been a long time since last time I posted a topic
<img alt=":oops:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/embarrassed.png" title="embarassed"/>
. I was working on remembering all my dreams but I wasn't disciplined enough. Somehow in an evening before drifting to my dream I had my second trip so far.
<br>
<br>
I was asleep but consciously aware of my surroundings. I wanted to open my eyes but couldn't. It felt like sleep paralysis. I was excited but a little scared and hesitated as well. I just moved away from home, being away from family and friends, everything felt different to me and I did have some negative thoughts. I was afraid this might take me to a  negative energy place, but then when I thought about how seldom this chance was to me I couldn't help but going on. I told myself not to think this in a bad way.
<br>
<br>
With my eyes closed I tried to make myself see the surrounding and raise up. It felt like I floated up from my body but everywhere was still dark.  I tried to look at myself starting from my hands. I was amazed when I saw my hands like seeing them in X-ray, instead of bones they were very thin and long and pointing at the end of every finger. They were not stable images either. I couldn't believe it. I straightened up my neck and bent it again to see my hands and
<img alt=":!:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
again I saw the strange images. Then I saw my feet in a same manner too. I stood still didn't know what  to do.  There might be other entities looking exactly like me, I thought to myself feeling scared. After a while nothing happened though, I floated to the balcony-I wanted to fly.
<br>
<br>
I was going to jump over my balcony then I again chickened out by seeing the height(I live on sixth floor). I climbed on the outside of it looking really silly but then I saw a light switch on the wall next to me. It left me no space to think it was unusual to have a light switch on the outside wall next to the balcony, then I saw a light below it.  I was standing on the outside of the balcony holding the fence and the light was below me too.  I couldn't help myself, I wanted to turn the light on, it, of course, didn't work.
<br>
<br>
To my surprise, everything changed since then. My balcony turned to be on the second floor. I climbed down to the ground and at the same time to a different place. I was back in the Victorian-styled lounge again(See my first trip:A smiling vision), but this time nobody's here. Walking through it, passing a concierge(he didn't move at all making me wonder whether he was dozing off or dead) there was an open-air space. Many people from different places were there dressing quite modern. I asked a man(white skin)where I was. He told me the name of this place. I didn't think this was Shanghai.
<br>
<br>
There were questions in my mind for a long time maybe the answers were here. I started to look for answers and approached to a door with curtain.  Several people(yellow skin like me) were outside the curtain dressing in an old style. I started to ask them questions but strange enough they didn't notice me like they couldn't see me.  Then I decided to enter the door.
<br>
<br>
At this point, I heard something back from my own room. Somebody was talking outside my room and it  became louder and louder. I could sense that I was going back to where I was from. What a pity! I haven't figured things out yet!  After that everything went in a blur. I woke up finding my heart beat really fast.  After I was calm again I wrote it down on my notebook.
<br>
<br>
All in all, it was an amazing experience. I will never forget the moment  I saw my distorted hands.

However, I didn't find the answers to my questions. Is there anything missing? Anything else I could try out in this kind of experience? I know my broken English is a big drag, but I want to share it with anyone who has the strength to finish reading my experience

and I will be more than happy to exchange ideas with all of you:o

It's been a long time since I posted too
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
. So I'll declare myself back in!
<br>
<br>
I had a similar thought in my last lucid dream where I wanted to jump off a building to 'test' whether it's a dream. I believe it's a far safer option to try to take off from the ground first though

<br>
<br>
One question. Last time you said you thought the name of the place was important. This time back in the same place the man told you the name. What does it mean?
<br>
<br>
As for your questions. Is there anything missing - no. Everything is the way it is for a reason. Everything's always perfect (until we start judging, quantifying and analysing.)
<br>
<br>
Love, love.

I wrote down the name as soon as I was back but it didn't make any sense to me. Last time it was a place the woman was going and I recalled a vague pronunciation, this time it was the name of the place I was at and I remembered it clearly.
<br>
<br>
Maybe it's not the time for me to choose to understand it but I am sure the meaning is there.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your message and tell me more about your lucid dream if you don't mind.
