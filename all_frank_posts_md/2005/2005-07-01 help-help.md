I am very new to all of this..Actually I read on it yet havent tried any of it yet. How do I do it? I read about but I dont understand how? Can anyone help me? I heard about something like back and forth but I dont understand.. I want to start meditating but I think this would be much more fullfilling.. How do I start?

read the Astral FAQ's section.  All of it.  Multiple times.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
As has been previously suggested, please read the FAQ section and we have a handy Search facility also. Naturally if you have points that you cannot get to grips with on any topic then by all means ask in the appropriate forum. All the best.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Antrophec
<br>
<br>
As you are very new to it all, perhaps you ought to learn to simply relax first?  Don't have any goals except relaxing your whole being, including your mind.
<br>
<br>
You'll no doubt fall asleep more often than not, but once you learn to
<i>
 really
</i>
relax, you can then move on.
<br>
<br>
It's one of the most frustrating things about projection - you can't rush into it.  It creeps up on you when you least expect it.  You just have to learn how to get to that "least expect it" state.
<br>
<br>
Good luck, whatever you decide
