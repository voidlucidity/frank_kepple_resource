Hey Gang,
<br>
<br>
I'd like to share just a wee bit of background then describe what I'm feeling.  In response, hopefully some of you can give me some feedback as to whether I'm making progress or mistaking what I'm feeling for something else.
<br>
<br>
First, I believe it's usually pretty easy for me to find my crown chakra.  I calm myself, raise my consciousness (focus) to the center of my brow - watch my thoughts - and then just kinda wait for it to happen.  Upon doing this I soon notice a pulse there.  It feels sorta like short little bursts of air with a slight throbbing.
<br>
<br>
Well, anyway, I'm still waiting on my 90 Day course to come in - but in the meantime I've been making good use of the tutorials on this site.  This past weekend I also spent quite a long time working on the energy exercises while finishing up listening to Robert's audio interviews.  (awsome stuff by the way)..
<br>
<br>
After that I lay in bed and almost immediately felt my crown chakra - very nice and soothing I thought.  But not too long after that, without any real effort of my own I felt the same thing in my heart.
<br>
<br>
I was like a soft pulsating beat - at a hastened speed. - It was 'air-like' but not air.   It started slowly at first but quickly progressed in speed to that of a 'flutter.'  Then, soon after that,  I found the same pulse in my throat.  It was below what that which I'd call a flutter - but nevertheless faster than a heartbeat.  I think I'd also describe it as deeper, if that makes any sense.
<br>
<br>
Anyway - it was really pleasurable.  And I believe it was me finding these chakras.  But before I take that for granted I thought I might run the description by you guys and see if this sounds right to you.
<br>
<br>
Also - sorry for such a long post.. lol.. I'll try to be more succinct  next time..

I spend a lot of time doing the same things.  I recommend you keep practicing, because you only get better, and the sense of progress is what keeps me going.  I'd also recommend you spend some time doing energy raising every day (robert bruce describes the technique very well) because this will help your progress a lot.  Anyway, good luck.

That sounds about right, but make sure it's not simply your 2-heartbeat that you're feeling.  I'm saying 2 because in reality, your heart pumps out, retracts and than pumps again, which does give the impression of it pumping twice (at least for me it does).  When I take my pulse sometimes, (if I lightly touch my skin instead of applying a lot of pressure, it feels like there's an intermediate beat, but it's really just the pressure going down.
<br>
<br>
If you relax a lot, you can actually feel your heartbeat pretty much anywhere (that's actually a good thing since it implies that you are that much relaxed).  You'll know when energy moves because it feels kind'a like you are nervous/in love.  At least for me, it's like there are butterflies in your stomach, but of course, it's less intense than that.  it's more constant.  The stomach is the first big storage of the energy body, so naturally, if the energy can move from your body to it, you've triggered your energy body.  Initially, unknowingly, I was doing energy work and my stomach felt weird (like I was nervous) for about a week after which it calmed down and became very light (like being in love, but less intense)
<br>

Hope it helps,

Hello Gorilla - and Legend....  Thanks, so much..
<br>
<br>
I'm almost certain this wasn't a heartbeat.  I was at total rest - calm - and the speed was that of a flutter.  It seemed the more I relaxed and just let it be the more pronounced and faster it would become.  But whatever the case, I wanted to do a double check on myself to make sure I'm just not experiencing the fruit of wishful thinking..  lol
<br>
<br>
I think I'm going to hold off for a few days though - at least until my copy of MAP comes in.  Having read the site a little further now I see it's impt. to work on the small energy centers before moving onto these larger ones - or at least that's the way I understand it now.
<br>
<br>
But man - was Robert ever right about the dreams.  I'm about 4 days into this now.  I rarely ever dream.    But I seem to have dreamed all night last night.
<br>
<br>
Hope this keeps up - I like it..

JK:

<br>
When you say short little bursts of air that's what you internally hear, right? As if it were a sound like an air release? In other words, you
<i>
 hear
</i>
it in your head more than you feel it as pressure?
<br>
<br>
The other sensations re: heart and throat I recognise in that you are at the stage where you are "finding" these energy centres (sorry, but I tend to avoid the term Chakra as there are just too many ridiculous belief-constructs attached to that word). The heart, for example, you should be able to amplify to the point where it feels like your physical heart is racing and your whole body has expanded to about 4 times the size. It gives you the feeling you are made of some lightweight jelly-like substance and you get all light and floaty.
<br>
<br>
The other thing you might do is when you feel the (green) heart centre "fluttering" send the energy down to your yellow centre, and then send it further down. I won't say what that feels like. I'll leave it up to you. :)  But once you get the feeling in mind, with a little tactile manipulation you can also transfer it to your significant other. Let's just say it helps them shed a whole new light on the term, foreplay.
<br>
<br>
Let me know on the Crown question.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Unfortunately, I guess, I can't say I 'hear' it.  On the crown it is internal, but not audible.  It's like a pulse and truth be told I think it could easily be mistaken for one.  I guess what makes it seem different to me is that I only notice it if I still my mind - watch my thoughts - and center on that area.  It doesn't come up immediatly, but it's fairly easy to find.
<br>
<br>
I think the reason I mentioned air is because it feels like (excuse the analogy) a wuppie cushion underneath the forehead skin pulsating - as if were being tapped by an invisible finger - softly and repeatedly.  That said, - again - perhaps it's just a pulse.  But if so, it sure does get strong..  It seems too fast for a heartbeat too.  But who knows?
<br>
<br>
As for that other - lol - I guess I'll just report back later.  Thanks for the tip though.  No doubt I'll be working on it soon..
