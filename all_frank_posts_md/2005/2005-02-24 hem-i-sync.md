I was wondering what the connection between the left and right hemispheres of the brain does and how does this connection affects your phasing experiences.  I can already reach focus 10 and I have phased into the astral a couple of times through this bright multi-colored tunnel which I traveled through at a very high speed.  I am thinking of buying the hem i-sync tapes to facilitate this connection if it will enhance the experiences.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
People usually buy these products to get to the stage where you are basically at. If you can achieve a solid Focus-10 then that's half the battle. Not too far removed from that is the rest of it. I can't see the tapes would
<i>
 enhance
</i>
your experiences much (if at all). Initiate them, yes, chances are they would help and certainly worthwhile trying if you can afford them. But I cannot see they would give you anything over and above what you could achieve from simply practising what you do already. Well, that's my opinion.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I know focus 10 quite well but what is focus 12, more of the hypnogogic/image streaming stage? I have never had a formal definition of it. Also, the Focus 10 post should be on the top in one of the top sets of topics, Very good reading.

I found that reaching f10 was easy i did it on my first try, but i think that that might have had to do with the fact i have ben trying to ap for 3 years now and have done it about 2 or 3 times now....do you think that that heps when learning to phase?
