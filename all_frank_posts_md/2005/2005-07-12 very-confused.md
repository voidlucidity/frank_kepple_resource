<section>
I have been trying to astral project for about a year now with no success, I have been reading about phasing however and I am left confused.
<br>
<br>
When you astral project you are taken to the spiritual planes, where you can explore and blah blah blah.
<br>
<br>
I read a post on the astral pulse island which explained you can get there through phasing, but the island is in the spiritual planes?
<br>
<br>
<br>
So phasing and astral projection both lead to the spiritual plains? And if they do how so?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
When you "astral project" a person typically engages an action-equation within the area known as Primary Focus 2 of consciousness that incorporates a particular mix of the elements of Beliefs, Desires, Expectations and Intents for a given Outcome.
<br>
<br>
Phasing is also an action-equation in consciousness, but the balance of the elements that go to forming that equation are rather different. This is because Phasing is a term that represents an entirely different, more modern-day ideology. An ideology that does not incorporate any "spiritual" belief constructs, or any other religious or mystical belief constructs.
<br>
<br>
Your explanation presupposes a number of traditional, more mystical factors that are simply not part of the Phasing Model action-equation.
<br>
<br>
The "astral plains" model is a more traditional model of consciousness where, in the formation of the model, people assumed a number of aspects about the Wider Reality that we are realising now don't quite add up. As such, there is often no direct correlation between the traditional models and the modern-day models of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Phasing does not lead a person to any kind of "plain", spiritual or otherwise. Nor is Phasing about placing value judgements on any particular experience. Phasing, in a nutshell, is the action of a person shifting their mental focus of attention to a different part of their own consciousness continuum.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Thanks a lot for taking the time to help Frank. It's kind of a relief. Because all the spiritual talk on other astral projection forums made me confused.
<br>
<br>
I am making slow progress with phasing but much faster then the progress I was making with APing.
<br>
<br>
So once again thanks for the help and thanks for all your writings on the subject. They are helping me greatly
