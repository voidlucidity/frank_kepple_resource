How do i search the forums for a collection of words, like say, "manifesting your reality"
<br>
Ive tried using speech marks and various other methods but i just keep getting results that have nothing to do with the topic or query im looking for.
<br>
<br>
Thanks.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Searching for Keywords...
<br>
<br>
You can use AND to define words which must be in the results, OR to define words which may be in the result and NOT to define words which should not be in the result. Use * as a wildcard for partial matches.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
