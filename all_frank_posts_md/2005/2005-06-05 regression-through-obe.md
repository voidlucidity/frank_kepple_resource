Is it possible to "regress" while having an OBE experience.
<br>
IÂ´m interested what my past lives might have been and does I need to be hypnotized by another person in order to do this or could I do it by myself while Out of the body?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The concept of "past lives" is an interesting one. Problem is, once you step outside of the physical "time", as such, doesn't exist. So there can be no past or future outside of a physical-system linear time construct. So to fly directly in the face of the zillions of mystics who claim otherwise, none of us can possibly have a "past" life. It's just that these people do not realise that we can, of course, merge with other focuses. But our other focuses are not us, as such. We can merge with them, but we are not them. We have never been them and we will never become them. Sorry to anyone who ever paid good money for a "past life reading" and all that.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I'm still confused about this issue Frank. You say that we were never 'them' and will never 'become them', but in your description of focus 4 you talk of becoming your 'total self' which presumably is the full 'you' that sent out all these focuses into physical lives... I would have thought that once all focuses 'return' to focus 4, i.e. realise that they are their 'total self' in focus 4, they would all in effect become part of the focus 4 personality and therefore all one.
<br>
<br>
Or do all the individually created focuses still retain their own individuality somehow?
<br>

Doug:
<br>
<br>
I understand your questioning because this very aspect has been on my mind for two years. All this time I have been trying to form an understanding based on the facts of what actually happens.
<br>
<br>
The big, BIG difficulty is in the understanding of the nature of the relationship between Simultaneous Time and Linear Time. The other major problem is in the understanding of that relationship in terms of the comprehension of these Trans-Dimensional areas of consciousness that I mentioned a few times in other threads. These Trans-Dimensional areas in consciousness not only provide a kind of continuity interface between a Simultaneous and a Linear time construct they also allow each physical-reality universe to overlay each other and yet (for the most part) remain separate. Which is quite a tall order both in terms of understanding and in effect. To cap it all, there is a third major problem in the understanding of the relationship between the subjective and the objective in terms of translation of energy.
<br>
<br>
On all these counts, presently, I do very much fall down in my explanation.
<br>
<br>
I fully admit that I do not know the answers. I don't even know the questions to ask at times. I said a little while ago that if I had written a book on Focus 4 six months ago I'd want to scrap it already. My knowledge gets updated every week to the point where I look back to a month ago and I think, wow.
<br>
<br>
Your total self is a term I use knowing that the term "self" is related to a bodily construct. People do get body fixated but as I've said a number of times, a body is merely an objective representation of the accumulation of a particular set of expectations regarding the enactment of certain types of actions within particular areas of consciousness. It holds no other purpose.
<br>
<br>
When you adopt Focus 4 as your Primary Focus, you become a point of consciousness that encompasses all your reality. Your focuses never, ever "rejoin" you. You simply become a kind of "umbrella self" that views
<u>
 all
</u>
your focuses as a conceptual reality, not as a reality in themselves in terms that we, here, would understand it. That is what you are doing now. You are engaging the focus of Doug as a reality in objective terms within a linear time framework. Once you have completed your current venture, you may (or may not) engage the focus of xxx within yyy linear time framework. Or not, as I say, as you choose. But while we talk about the linear engagement of these ventures in such actions in consciousness, from a "total self" viewpoint they are all concepts, all possibilities that are open to us at any one moment. Because from that Focus 4 perspective, there is no "time". And that, my friend, is the big stumbling block. The explanation of how can there be no-time and time occurring simultaneously. Once I work out how those Trans-Dimensional areas function then hopefully I'll be able to present a solid explanation.
<br>
<br>
I am hoping that as more people engage Focus 4 and present themselves with an objective knowing of their current focus
<i>
 as a concept
</i>
then a completely rational explanation shall emerge. Rather in the same way we now call the 3D-Blackness Fz. In the meantime, I introduce the concept as best I can and hope for the best. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

a lot of people talk about levels up &amp; down, but seldom side to side. from my experience all i can say (and i'm not the expert at this forum), but i have no problem with the ideas of past lives. i do believe that we have lived many, many times over...and yes i have accessed these during obe's/AP. there are also parallel lives (i believe) millions. different versions of yourself that would appear similar to standing between two mirrors that are facing each other and seeing your reflection go on forever. millions of reflections of your mind. one mind overseeing them all. very easy to access during AP. i also believe these to be very well balanced...ranging from versions of yourself that would scare the excrement out of you, to the most serene and gentle...and everything in between. all learning lessons and gathering experiences for the collective mind. if you exist here...why not elsewhere? why is it so easy (or correct) to imagine there is only one version of you? and so hard to imagine that you are limitless. once again...what is the purpose of the box? why must we draw lines around something completely beyond us in an attempt to better understand it??? i think it's very male (stuck-male). it's vivisecting the animal so as to better understand it's nature. forgetting that it's nature has now changed. it's dead!

i guess we all have many many focuses that we engage with and therefore experience almost every possible aspect of physical existance.
<br>
<br>
This kind of makes sense as one of the most appealing aspects of reincarnation theory is that if you dont manage to expererience certain things during your life, you can always do so in the future.
<br>
<br>
However, with the traditional version of reincarnation in doubt, this led to me thinking well, looks like if you miss something then your screwed, you'll never get a chance to do it again.. which almost brings me back to the dismal 'one life, one chance only' concept of secular, sceptical thought.
<br>
<br>
However, from what your saying about your 'total self' engaging a whole myriad of physical focuses, silmultaniously, then it appears that we do after all get to experience every possible aspect of physical experience (from a focus 4 perspective), through these myriad focuses... this approach actually sounds far more extensive than the traditional approach!
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
PS Frank, are you aware of Bruce Moen's theory? He calls these 'total selves' his 'disk'.. but then he goes further and says these 'disks' are in themselves part of an even greater 'total' self somewhere else, which in turn is belongs to something even greater and so it goes on until you arrive finally at the total self that IS everything ie what traditional accounts call 'god'... nice idea but completely unprovable!

I was just reminded of a post by Ginny once upon a time, in which she talked about visiting an area where there was a group of beings who were actively focused on creating things. The interesting thing was, Ginny noted that it wasn't *what* they were creating that was important, it was the *act* of creation that was the point. All these beings were 100% focused on the act of creation, that is, they became the embodiment of the *concept* of creation.
<br>
<br>
I didn't understand what Ginny was on about at the time and I don't think she had any idea what the encounter was about either, but judging from Frank's description of F4, I would say that we have a good example of a group of beings/individuals engaged in a *concept* of something, in line with what Frank has been describing. By some means or other, she was given the opportunity to objectively view this in operation.
