My mom got this in her mail from a friend. Seems weird... if it wasn't for the reference to July that some others have posted about here previously I'd probably just disregard it as the usual spam but now I'm posting it here instead. Any comments?

Hello everyone,     I would suggest, because this text can be quite dense,
<br>
that it be read with the heart and not the mind.  This information was
<br>
received by Judith Moore who I know personally and for whom I have a high
<br>
regard. Ed
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Family of light,  I rarely send out mass mailings but this feels
<br>
really important.  I also am not an alarmist and rarely get a call to get
<br>
people throughout the world to focus together to help our planet in this
<br>
time of transition, BUT this one got my attention. The Arcturian Council and
<br>
the Council of Aboraha came through at 5 a.m. this morning really strong.  I
<br>
<br>
received this channeled information.  I did not have time to edit it
<br>
properly as I leave in  the morning to be with my daughter for surgery on
<br>
Wednesday.
<br>
<br>
PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.
<br>
<br>
Remember we can make a difference when we unite with love to help our
<br>
planet.
<br>
<br>
Mitakyue Oyasin, We are all related, we are all one.

Blessings

<br>
High priority message from the Arcturians
<br>
<br>
<br>
The two Councils are telling me that Earth is going through some kind of a
<br>
time warp, that the time fields are in flux right now, and that the
<br>
Arcturians have
<br>
had  to place a stabilizer field. I can see four Mother ships around the
<br>
planet.
<br>
They have put an energy device on the planet that is assisting the cohesion
<br>
 of the particles. (I do not understand exactly what they mean).
 <br>
  <br>
   <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Earth is at a crucial point where mass and
    <br>
    matter are in, well, we are in a transitional phase: in the way that
    <br>
    electrons adhere to each other in photon energy with the molecules,
    <br>
    the protons and neutrons inside the molecules. There is something called a
    <br>
    'cohesion field' and it is the way that protons and neutrons relate to
    <br>
    each other in an electromagnetic field.  The nature of magnetism has gone
    <br>
    into a phase of acceleration and I hear the words 'transmugenative
    <br>
    metamorphosis' and we are at a critical point whereby all mathematical
    <br>
    probability in this transference pattern, the changing of the electrical
    <br>
    charges in protons and neutrons, would cause an instability of mass and
    <br>
    matter, thus we are at a peak of planetary chaos.
    <br>
    I can see four great ships, bigger than Mother ships.
    <br>
    They are something like space stations. They are huge and they are cloaked,
    <br>
    from Nassau. They are cloaked but are there. They have their equipment
    <br>
    there but without being seen by people or detected by satellites. I can see
    <br>
    this force field and they are projecting it from the both poles and
    <br>
    the equator; this force field is around the planet to help us stabilize. But
    <br>
    they are telling me that the probability of some major Earth changes between
    <br>
    now and the first of July is very high. That the greatest time of
    <br>
    instability is now. We are presently at a time of one of the peak points
    <br>
    when massive Earth changes can occur. We are all feeling this on a cellular
    <br>
    and individual level and the chaos factor is at its peak.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We are being told that there will be reports of birth anomalies, of human
    <br>
    and animal defects.
    <br>
    When women are during a certain stage of pregnancy a disorientation
    <br>
    of electron particles occurs when the DNA is forming the map for
    <br>
    the physical body. This can cause abnormalities in babies and
    <br>
    animals because it would mainly affect those that are in their 1st
    <br>
    trimester, a very critical moment when the DNA map is formed. Our
    <br>
    extra-terrestrial
    <br>
    friends are actually focusing a special kind of energy, called
    <br>
    'congenative embryonic restoration fields'. It is somewhat similar to the
    <br>
    monitors that are put into baby cribs that reproduce a mother's heart
    <br>
    beat. They are projecting, broadcasting these from the space stations.
    <br>
    Similar to the idea of entrainment where you establish a beat that the
    <br>
    planet
    <br>
    follows in alignment. It is like the heart of the cosmic mother
    <br>
    that is helping to stabilize the embryo.  What is happening now is that we
    <br>
    can have a whole spate of abnormal births because of the stage of the
    <br>
    embryonic development and due to this disorientation to the electromagnetic
    <br>
    fields.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am being told that it is very important to send this
    <br>
    informationout by email. That we are being asked to visualize ourselves as
    <br>
    grounding rods as lightening rods. We are to see ourselves as conductors for
    <br>
    stabilizing energy fields.
    <br>
    We are being told there will be disturbances in interpersonal relationships
    <br>
    because of the very powerful flux of the time fields and
    <br>
    the electron particles right now.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The hologram that keeps the apparent reality stable, itself remains stable
    <br>
    right now but although there seems to be a substantial stability field,
    <br>
    there are massive areas of the hologram that are wobbling, at present.
    <br>
    <br>
    One way to describe this is as when a movie gets out of focus and everything
    <br>
    seems to become blurred.
    <br>
    There are whole fields of the hologram that are currently unstable.
    <br>
    The majority of the field is stable which is sufficient enough to keep us
    <br>
    from disintegrating. But there is much area of our perceptual reality that
    <br>
    is unstable and in a warp pattern.
    <br>
    The areas that are blurred will be the ones that are subject to earth
    <br>
    changes and this may well include the west coast of North America.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This information is for those who are aware they can be conductors for this
    <br>
    energy that is attuned to the heartbeat of the universe.
    <br>
    <br>
    Right now we are like an infant in a crib and the Arcturians are emanating
    <br>
    this force field, it is a heartbeat of the Universe. The intent of that is
    <br>
    to
    <br>
    establish a rhythm to help the electron particles to reorient because it is
    <br>
    a stabilizing energy of that heartbeat of the universe. It is being
    <br>
    sent in a harmonic wave through the planet right now and those of us who are
    <br>
    aware, can be grounding rods to help that energy to stabilize the planet.
    <br>
    <br>
    This message needs to get out as soon as possible. They are telling me
    <br>
    that they do not use the word 'urgent, but rather the words 'high
    <br>
    priority'. Those of you who receive this message are asked to relay it to as
    <br>
    many people as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are being instructed to set our intent to communicate to our own body's
    <br>
    electron fields to communicate telepathically the message of the energy
    <br>
    <br>
    of stability to everything. Think of the web of life and the fact that we
    <br>
    are all related.
    <br>
    <br>
    If we can focus on being the microcosm and our planet
    <br>
    and all of humanity as being the macrocosm, we can create stability in our
    <br>
    microcosm and thus help the macrocosm to stabilize.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the challenge is the extraordinarily high instability right now. Let us
    <br>
    be encouraged and stay focused on stabilizing peaceful energy and
    <br>
    communicating telepathically to our cells, encouraging our cells that the
    <br>
    transition can be made.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are all being asked right now to be midwives to the birth of our planet,
    <br>
    Earth. Just as a midwife helps the mother to breathe, we need to do the same
    <br>
    to our own cells, to our microcosmic orbital fields encouraging a birth that
    <br>
    is smooth and gentle and stable.  We are at a point of extreme instability
    <br>
    on the planet.
    <br>
    TI woulhe tsunami was like the breaking of the waters in the birth process
    <br>
    for Mother Earth.

With all the respect, this sounds me to bovine excrement.
<br>
<br>
Nowdays its very common seing this type of messages and everything day say never happens.
<br>
<br>
Even if this is a real message i will keep acting as normal, trying to improve myself and my inner peace. If Arturians are real and want us to believe on them, they must be crazy! Suppose that its real (for me its not): why should we believe in aliens taht we dont see that contacted us by chanelling into a specific person of this planet?
<br>
<br>
I love this part of the message;
<br>
<br>
<br>
"The hologram that keeps the apparent reality stable, itself remains stable
<br>
right now but although there seems to be a substantial stability field,
<br>
there are massive areas of the hologram that are wobbling, at present."
<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but...are we in the Matrix?! lol..NEO! HELP US!

Typical new age nonsense. All this energy stabilizing won't help, scientific parts only seem to be valid and etc.
<br>
Nothing interesting will happen as with hundreds of messages that were before this. If all those new agers would concentrate on destroying negs and healing world by healing specific people's like greed, hatred, etc. maybe they could acheve some effects, but fantasy channelings like this are a waste of time.

Neutrons never had an electrical charge to begin with!

 in the way that

<br>
<br>
Is this guy serious?  Electrons adhere to each other in photon energy??  Photons are quantized energy packets emitted through electromagnetic radiation.  The only way I can think of that electrons and photons interact is through the photoelectric effect, where a photon tossed at short frequency wavelength impacts an electron on a metallic surface and knocks it off.
<br>
<br>
This guys needs to get his chemistry and physics together if he wants to attract any followers into his religion or belief, especially if it includes super intelligent animals from another planet.

<section>
Agree with you Caco. The message that new agers pass its this: heal the world because the end is near...heal it or you wil lbe destroyed" my message is "heal the world because we we need a reacher life..heal the world because you want to create happyness inall beings".
<br>
<br>
In other words, they send messages of terror, when they should be sending messages of peace.

Maybe. Of course that will not disregard any possibilitie. Maybe  there are arturians, aliens, whatever trying to warn us about the earth, but in this case i bet thats a lie.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I was trying to think of the most descriptive phrase and
<i>
 pseudo-scientific gobbledegook
</i>
I thought rather apt.
<br>
<br>
I never know where these people are coming from who produce this kind of tosh. I notice a number of religious people/organisations/sects/etc. today are putting a more kind of "scientific slant" to their work in order to usurp a sense of credibility where none would otherwise exist. But they just trip themselves up. They forget there are people who actually do understand the basics of how atoms organise themselves, or whatever branch of science it is they are pontificating about. Usually Physics it would appear.
<br>
<br>
I learnt the other day that it's all the rage amongst various religious groups to claim that all manner of so called "scientific truths" exist in books such as the bible. Trying to make out these books were some Physics text book from long ago or something, and leading in the gullible under some pretext of scientific credibility. It's pitiful really the lengths some of these people will go to in order to try and deceive people. The answer to why they feel at liberty to preach to others about a wider reality they have no first-hand experience of, always did have me flummoxed.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Lol, interesting - please, satisfy my curiosity, what were these "scientific truths"? I remember hearing about the dimension of Noahs Ark making it a perfect candidate for long, difficult ocean journey - but I guess I must have missed the show where they discuss Jesus' lessons on collective electrodynamics

This set out the basic theme and another member came along and pointed out people were saying the same thing about the bible. I thought the original post was based upon some ramblings of a single "mad professor". But no, as a result I did a little digging and it's just incredible what goes on in terms of pseudo-science these days.

<br>
Neutron 1 (N1) and Neutron 2 (N2) collide
<br>
<br>
Before : N1 = Charge 1 (C1), N2 = Charge 2 (C2)
<br>
<br>
After : N1=C2, N2=C1
<img alt=":!:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Clearly, neutron 1 gets the same charge as neutron 2 had before the collission, and neutron 2 gets the same charge as neutron 1 had
