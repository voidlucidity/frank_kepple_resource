Hey Gang,
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Are there any specific mantras associated with Astral Travel?
<br>
<br>
I've also heard that burning "Copal" can be  conducive to astral travel.
<br>
<br>
Any merit to these claims?

Hey JK,
<br>
<br>
Good to see there's someone here from MS as that's where I originally come from. Now in Memphis though.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, to answer your question, as far as I know some believe there are mantras that can specifically help with AP. If you want to PM me your e-mail address, I have a PDF file devoted specifically to the use of mantras for astral projection I can send you.

Om-Mani-Padme-Hum, "Hail to the jewel in the lotus", the mantra of Avalokiteshvara(Lord who attained enlightenment thru the contemplation of sound, not the sounds you hear externally, but the sound you hear when you read a book silently to yourself, or thinking a thought).
<br>
<br>
Get yourself a mala, and do 2-3 rounds, each round is 108 beads, so 108 mantras 3 times. It creates the necessary sound vibration necessary to achieve an OBE.
<br>
<br>
It's kind of like being at the beach, in the ocean for a couple of hours, later that night while going to sleep, you can still feel the ocean waves running thru you.
<br>
<br>
Or you can use a Photo/Acoustic Mantra form such as a Light and Sound Machine like the NOVA PRO 100.
<br>
<br>
I have also used the Migtsema prayer, that is helpful too. I'll be saying it with a mala while going to sleep, and wake up in the dream saying it, and then notice the change in the environment, from there LD, from there OBE.

Hey Astral Man -  S7 - Potential -
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Astral, thanks for the feedback.  Perhaps that will be on the PDF from S7.
<br>
<br>
And S7, nice to meet you.  Memphis is such a nice place, or at least that's how I recall it.  I spent my summers there when I was young.  My father was head of the philosophy dept. at Memphis State (it's name then.).  I'm in McComb, MS now (where it's always raining on 'color radar' - lol).  But nice to meet ya, and I'll be sending you that PM as soon as I finish.
<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you also, Potential. (Deep Bows to ya) My other name is Konchok Samten.  I tool my vows from Garchen Rinpoche about two years ago at the
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.garchen.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Garchen Institute
</a>
in Prescott, Arizona.  It was the purpose of the trip, but I was lucky to stay for 4 weeks.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again everyone...  Talk to ya later - And Cheers!

I looked in one of my books and could find no historical use of copal resin for astral projection. A popular incense blend (which I believe originally comes from Dion Fortune) is 1 part Benzoin, 1 part Mugwort, and 1 part Jasmine. Mugwort has a long history of being used in astral projection. I would say the most important thing is 1) to choose an incense that you find pleasing in its aroma. and 2) as RB and BM point out in Mastering Astral Projection, an incense that you don't use for any other purposes except astral projection. So whatever incense you decide to use you will associate strictly with astral projection.

Hey again, S7 -  Thanks..
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I'll see if the supplier I use (Tibetan Spirit) sells that.   My thoughts on the subject has been simply that the more care taken in selecting an incense the more effective it will be.  If we take a little time to research something like that it shows more care and makes it a little more personal.  The result is that if you're making it as an offering it means a little more to ya, and I will be burning this on my alter.
<br>
<br>
Anyway - thanks again.  Best of luck.  And cheers!

<section>
JK,
<br>
<br>
I personally believe that is the best way to use incense and other natural tools. When you research and ultimately formulate your own incense you infuse your own personal energy into it. Even with just a few carefully selected herbs, a censer, and a roll of charcoal tablets you can create your own powerful incense. Most people just go in a store and look for a packof incense that says "Astral Projection" or "Healing Incense" or whatever with no thought as to what synthetic ingredients comprise it. The most important thing though is to take whatever incense you decide to use and use it only for the purpose of AP. That way you come to associate that scent with AP.
