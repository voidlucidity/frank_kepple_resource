Hi:
<br>
<br>
What we observe as physical body death is the objective translation of the subjective action of a person shifting their Primary Focus of mental attention from Focus 1 to Focus 3 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Reincarnation is a religious belief construct formed from the early explorers' misunderstandings of the nature of the subjective/objective relationship (in terms of energy) between Focus 4 and Focus 1 of consciousness. In particular, misunderstandings regarding the relationship between Simultaneous Time and Linear Time.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
