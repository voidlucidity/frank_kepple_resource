Hii I have been practicing obe training for more then 2 years now. When I focus on my eyelids while trying to get into trance I get symptom of 3rd darkness where it feels like im suspending or getting bigger counscously visually sensed. It is visually seeing my counscousness expanding 3 dimensional threw closed eyelids. This last for about 5 25 mins at most and it all vanishes. Reason because I might of stoped my trance inducing behavior therefore countering 3d darkness. Anyway I just need some help. Any useful 3rd darkness information?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The Internet is full of info on 3D Blackness. Here we now call it Fzero or the FZ state for short. It's a very common phenomenon.
