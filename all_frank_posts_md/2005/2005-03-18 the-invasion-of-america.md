I don't know about this one. Fr. Wingate has had to take back some of his predictions because "heaven was testing his vigilance."
<br>
<br>
Oh well. This should at least provide some entertaining reading. It's the recap of Fr. Wingate's appearance on Coast to Coast as written on their website.

 Prophecy: The Invasion of America
 <br>
 Father Andrew Wingate returned to share his prophetic visions, which he says come to him from "heaven," and are confirmed with a group of other mystic priests, before he announces them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Here is a timeline of events that Wingate laid out: The Pope will be cured of a serious illness, but shortly after that he will go into exile for eight months, though the world will be told he has died. During this period he will "bilocate" and communicate with various religious communities. Around the time of the exile, the United States will be invaded by a united Russian and Chinese army, aided by additional communist forces. The US will already be fighting a war on three fronts when this happens.
 <br>
 <br>
 He outlined the devastating consequences of the invasion, which he expects to take place no later than four years from now: Around 30% of the US population will die before the invaders are stopped outside of Omaha, with some of the greatest losses occurring in Texas and the southern half of the country.
 <br>
 <br>
 Wingate predicted that the assassination of the leaders of France and Germany would precede the U.S. invasion. He also described a vision of an airborne bacteria that would take many lives, though he did not specify a time frame for this.

Why is it when people make perdictions sometimes they are always filled with doom and gloom? Is it in our nature to think this way? why?

I fail to see why China would waste the lives or the petrol for such overkill.
<br>
<br>
They could jerk our economic pants down to our ankles by just dumping the $1.9 trillion they hold in U.S. currency and Treasury notes.
<br>
<br>
Voila! instant defeat of Pax Americana.

<section>
well its because in the deluded mind of our mad preacher 'foaming Father Wingate' who probably doesnt know diddly squat about international affairs, is that he lumps in Russia and China as one because in his mind they come under the lame and out of date title of 'commies'.
<br>
<br>
The problem of course, if the whacked out crazyman bothered to look at what was going on in the world in recent decades, is that russia is no longer communist! In fact now its almost the opposite..a mafia state in some regions! As for China, yes they are officially 'communist', but there's something odd going on because if you go to Hong kong and especially Shanghai on the mainland, you will find a vibrant supermodern city, with a new rich growing middle classes and loads of people making money,places like shanghai are often said to be 'more western than the west' and certainly dont look in any way 'communist'.
<br>
<br>
The chinese are not interested in 'invading america'... the chinese just want to make money.. which they are doing... lots of it!
<br>
<br>
The reason the official 'communist' system is still in place, is because the chinese government prefer a longterm slow and systemised transition to full capitalist democracy, a slow controlled process that may take several *decades*, not months or years.
<br>
The reason is simple: they dont want the chaos and 'mafia state' situation that is the case with Russia, where they went for an overnight transition... they dont want the same situation as has happend in russia, and they are not going to hurry up just because the west told them to. It was the west and america which was constantly encouraging Â Russia to change ...but the change was too quick and look what happened.
<br>
<br>
Thats why the chinese felt threatened by Tianamen square in 1989. I know that was awful, but from their point of view, these idealistic and naive students were about to start a chain reaction that might overthrow the current system overnight.. sounds great, but look at russia, how many people have died since then as a result of organised crime and the russian mafia who virtually run half the country? probably more than the students in Tianamen square.
<br>
<br>
It may be the case that the slow scientific approach taken by China is the best way forward, no matter that it is too slow for the west. At least they have order and security and this has to be maintained and continued so that democracy can be brought in on a gradual, controlled level.
<br>
You cant have full democracy WITHOUT safety and security FIRST, as America has found out with Iraq. Peoples first priority is NOT freedom to vote.. its freedom to go outside and not be killed by roving bands of brigands and nutters on the streets.

PS oh, almost forgot, another important point is that since the 1950's Russia and China fell out and they really do not like each other! They really dont!

I agree Gandalf, I would also have to seriously question what Father Wingate knows about global politics. Apparently, he does not know that NATO, whom he says will attack America, is not the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without America. It sounds like a general case of xenophobia to me.
<br>
<br>
Is there anyone he left out that is not going to attack America?

Russia is on our doorstep. Many former countries of the "Soviet Block" are now paid-up members of the European Union. In Europe we are all getting on with celebrating our togetherness and putting all the war stuff behind us.
<br>
<br>
The Cold war was basically an American thing. They paid good money to rent the land to stick their airbases on. They subsidised all manner of defence contracts, blah, blah, blah... it was good while it lasted. Many people made a packet. But times move on.
<br>
<br>
Father Wingate, lol, sounds like he missed a double dose of whatever his doctor prescribed.
<br>
<br>
"Only in America" as we Europeans always say.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

if a vision occurred of an uneventful century, why would you mention it ? :p
<br>
people are more interested in 'doom'-stories (especially because if they are only predictions, people still have hope the future might change)
