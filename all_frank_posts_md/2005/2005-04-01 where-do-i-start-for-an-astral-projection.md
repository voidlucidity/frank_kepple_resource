Perhaps the FAQ section may give you some pointers, and the Search facility should throw up a wealth of information.

Search for meditation or "energy raising".  Those are going to be the first couple of steps to your journey.

<section>
In MajorTom's "What are the focus levels?" thread in the FAQ forum, there does'nt seem to be anything on focus 2oC, why is that? I managed to find an explanation in Frank's "What is Phasing and how can I do it?" however.
<br>
<br>
Also I think "energy raising" would only distract and hinder your efforts.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It is because the 4-focuses pertain to my Phasing Model of consciousness. Whereas Focus 10 pertains to the Monroe linear model.
<br>
<br>
Which, of course, begs the question of why do we have these models? And why are they different?
<br>
<br>
First, simply because it's not possible to explain it any other way.
<br>
<br>
In the physical, if I wanted to explain to you about water, for example, I don't need to present you with a model of its properties. Because anyone can just turn on a tap, or go for a swim in a lake, or stand in the rain, or something. But with inner realms of reality you can't just point to an objective example and say there, take a look at that. So to explain what we mean, we have to develop a model that represents the inner, i.e. subjective, reality.
<br>
<br>
Monroe was the first person, to my knowledge, to realise that the areas of consciousness we project to are not places, as mystics typically (and wrongly) assume. They are
<i>
 focuses of attention
</i>
. Monroe, therefore, developed a model of consciousness that took account of this. In his work, he noticed that the various focuses of attention had certain individual properties, which were objectively viewable and repeatable. So he labelled these states with an arbitrary series of numbers, in an effort to help other people understand the wider reality.
<br>
<br>
The Monroe model is really good in many ways, but it still falls short of taking account of the true extent of the wider reality.
<br>
<br>
For example, the Monroe model is excessively individualistic. This makes it ideal for beginners, but each of us is a focus-personality participating in a
<i>
 simultaneous
</i>
cycle of manifestation. As opposed to the reincarnational cycle that Monroe appears to support, along with mainstream religious and New Age models. Not that I actually know much about mainstream religion or New Age, but from what I gather they generally support the somewhat incorrect reincarnational model, as opposed to the correct
<i>
 simultaneous
</i>
model.
<br>
<br>
So the challenge, then, for anyone like myself, trying to map the inner reality in a more straighforward scientific sense (as opposed to the somewhat convoluted religious and mystical constructs) is how to translate the typology of all-that-is in a
<i>
 true
</i>
sense, into some kind of model that people can relate to.
<br>
<br>
The Monroe model is very good. For a first attempt by a lone explorer it was something special, and it is still very applicable today. But it was my frustration with the Monroe model in my attempts to "go beyond" Focus 27 that led me to develop a completely new model that I call the Phasing Model.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing Model does away with the arbitrary numbers of the Monroe model and labels just the 4 primary focuses of mental attention, within our system as a whole. It can be loosely related to the Monroe model as follows:
<br>
<br>
Monroe C1 – Phasing Model Focus 1
<br>
Monroe Focus's 3;10;12;15 &amp; 21 – Phasing Model Focus 2
<br>
Monroe Focus's 23; 24; 25; 26 &amp; 27 – Phasing Model Focus 3
<br>
No direct translation with Monroe – Phasing Model Focus 4
<br>
<br>
Like I say, it was my frustration in trying to go "beyond" F27 of the Monroe model that led me to discover Focus 4 of consciousness. Nothing about this area of consciousness, as far as I can tell, directly relates to anything Monroe published in Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey. So on that basis I am assuming it was not part of his knowledge. Which should not be taken as a criticism, as there was just so darned much of the wider reality that
<i>
 was
</i>
a part of his knowledge. And I, for one, would never have got as far as I did without having Monroe's work as a launch pad.
<br>
<br>
From knowledge gained from my being able to "plug into" Focus 4, I've managed to find out facts such as how the 4-Focus model can be related to early religious models. Amazingly, it would appear that all the major religious schools of thought based their thinking on a 4-Focus model of some description. Or what I mean is they held the notion of 4 primary areas in consciousness.
<br>
<br>
For example, Focus's 1 to 4 can be directly related to the early Christian model of Body; Psyche; Soul; Spirit, respectively. Though I'm not saying that everything they said from then on was necessarily correct, lol. Just that their primary thinking was based on the right lines, at least at some stage in the beginnings of their quest. But it all just developed into the ideological mess we see today.
<br>
<br>
The idea you
<u>
 always
</u>
have to hold in mind when adopting any kind of model, is that the words and the models are NOT the actual territory! My Phasing Model, is merely my best attempt yet at presenting a map of the wider reality, or what some people call "all that is". In your explorations, you must hold the idea of the map or model in mind, while
<i>
 simultaneously
</i>
seeking to "remember" what that model signifies.
<br>
<br>
Never forget, the map is NOT the territory.
<br>
<br>
I'm making a particular point of this because I see people fall into this trap all the time with the more mystical models. Which is all very well, I suppose, but I don't want people making that mistake with my own model, as it would defeat the whole purpose of my developing it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
all of sudden projection seems very complicated. from what ive read so far it should be something like this in short
<br>
<br>
1. relax
<br>
2. vibrate
<br>
3. project out of body
<br>
<br>
tho the methods still seems vauge, but im still looking into this vast knowledge on this boad
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
there is alot of stuff the focus stuff are interisting, but i thought that 'phasing' was like moving through solid objects as described on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.psipog.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

for example.

<section>
Ha ha ha ha, thanks for the link, passing through solid objects, lol. I'd like to see a demo of that. Here, take a run at this brick wall... splat!
<br>
<br>
Astral projection is a belief construct that people typically engage within the region of (in Phasing terms) Focus 2 of consciousness. The engagement of this action in consciousness sounds really easy... until... you actually come to try and do it.
<br>
<br>
But even if you do overcome all the inherent problems (as I did, for example, over a period of about 10 years) then what do you do next? As much as it may sound appealing, floating around your neighbourhood, for example, it does get boring after a while. The novelty of just projecting to the same area in consciousness does wear off, I assure you. So what then?
<br>
<br>
Well, if you are like me you will want to venture further "out" and discover all kinds of different realities. Try to get some answers to questions such as, why are we here? What is our purpose? How was the universe really formed? What really happens to people when they die? And all that kind of stuff.
<br>
<br>
In doing so you will eventually develop a wholly new mental framework as to the nature of the wider reality. To beginners, this may appear complex. Because to a certain extent the more intricate constructs are quite complex.
<br>
<br>
At the moment, for example, I am studying the interelationships between physical universes, in particular the Trans-Dimensional areas of consciousness that link these areas, and provide an interface between the simultaneous-time construct of Focus 4oC, and the various linear-time constructs pertaining to the physical realms in question.
<br>
<br>
I can tell you, for a start, the construct of simultaneous time is rather mind-blowing (to say the least). But the way in which simultaneous time interacts with physical-world linear time, and the interface that makes that interaction possible, is just unexplainable. Well, for me, at the moment that is.
<br>
<br>
So the challenge is to somehow "build a model" that accurately represents this section of the wider reality. Assuming I do that, I can then add this section to the existing model and go to work on understanding another section, then add that to the main model, and so forth. Eventually, I will have created an accurate picture or plan of the entire wider reality. Or at least as much of it as I can perceive.
<br>
<br>
But complete knowledge of the wider reality is by no means necessary in order to have experiences. Simply relax and start to use the Noticing exercise, for example. That's about as straightforward as it's possible to get.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Is that the reason Monroe did'nt go beyond Focus 27, because he got stuck in that trap of mistaking the territory for the map? Also, is what you call the map equivalent with what you call a belief construct and is that the reason why people returning from their physical experience go through a period of shaking off their belief constructs in Focus 3oC in order to enable them to merge fully with subjective reality, Focus 4oC? Or in other words, is it the beliefs which prevent the awareness of Focus 4oC and bound one to Monroe's Focuses 1-27? Should one not be bound by their beliefs, would that result in loss of usual sense of self and reality?
<br>
<br>
MajorTom, might it be an idea for you to add your first post in this thread to your focus levels thread in the FAQ forum because for someone unfamiliar with these models it can be confusing reading one thread with focuses 1-27 and another with focuses 1-4, just a suggestion.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the answer to the Monroe question. I can follow the model up to F27. It all checks out brilliantly. Then, Monroe and I veer off, unfortunately. At some stage, late in his career, Monroe came up with the F35 concept. He called it "The Gathering". Apparently, there is meant to be some kind of collection of alien spacecraft there monitoring "Earth changes".
<br>
<br>
Now, while I am a great fan of Monroe,
<u>
 anyone
</u>
starts talking to me about little green men in flying saucers I tend to hit the brakes and engage reverse gear pretty quick. :)
<br>
<br>
Monroe could well have made incursions into F4oC. There are parts where I think he perceived F4. Or at least an F4 overlay. All the 4 primary focus states are massively intertwined. They are not separate places all neatly laid out alongside each other. That's how I came to find out about F4 in the first place.
<br>
<br>
Once you recognise there are these 4 primary focus states, and you learn about the typical AIC's (actions in consciousness) that go on there, you can then pick out any overlays. Like, there was a member the other day who wrote about being in the RTZ and seeing WW1 soldiers. That's a typical F1/F3 overlay. People who project into the RTZ and have all kinds of "weird stuff" going on as well, meaning, they can see their room, but at the same time they perceive other stuff happening, are having an overlay experience between F1 and wherever.
<br>
<br>
WW1 soldiers marching about is a typical F3 AIC as F3 is the Transition Area. Meaning, the place everyone ends up after disengaging from the physical. So if you see a person or groups of people wearing soldier's uniforms wandering around lost, looking for their unit; or still attempting to fight a war, that kind of thing, you know that's an F3 AIC. I mean, all kinds of other stuff goes on there besides, but people in soldier's uniforms are a common and fairly obvious indicator of where you are.
<br>
<br>
If you think of something and it immediately comes to life, then you know you are focused within F2oC. So a typical overlay is an F1/F2 overlay. Where a person can perceive their room, but all kinds of fearful things are happening besides. That's because they are feeling fearful and they are seeing the objective manifestations of their fear coming to life, as it were, within F2oC but overlaid within F1.
<br>
<br>
Many people who are classed as mentally ill, are stuck in a kind of permanent overlay experience between F1 and wherever. People who "hear voices" and "see things that aren't there" that kind of thing. These are typical overlay experiences. Because, as I say, the 4 primary focuses of attention are massively entwined. It's just normally we place a kind of separation between here and there, so to speak. Which is a handy thing to do as it makes typical F1 AIC's a lot easier to perform. You don't want to be driving along in your car having all manner of F2 visual overlays, for example.
<br>
<br>
There are two basic types of perception in consciousness: subjective and objective. When transitioning between the two there is a period of adjustment necessary. It takes about 10 years to become fully accustomed to objective reality. Until such time as a person is fully integrated, they will have all kinds of F1 coupled with wherever, overlay experiences. Typically, children experience F1 and F2 overlays. Playing with an "imaginary friend" is an extremely common F1/F2 overlay. Not that your average child psychologist or parent sees it that way, of course. But that's what it is.
<br>
<br>
When you transition the other way, it all comes about in reverse. Instead of being primarily focused within objective reality and experiencing subjective-reality overlays, you are primarily focused within subjective reality experiencing objective-reality overlays. The time it takes to shake off the adoption of the constructs that cause these overlay experiences varies massively between individuals. Someone, such as myself, who more or less fully understands the process, will spend basically as little or as long as they want in Transition. But there are people, generally highly religious types, who have typically joined their particular idea of heaven, who I imagine have hundreds of years equivalent to go yet, before they finally realise it's all a construct they are subscribing to within F3oC.
<br>
<br>
We cannot help but be bound by our beliefs. Every AIC we engage within F1 relates to a construct of one type or another. Our perception creates our reality and one of the MAJOR factors influencing of our perception are the beliefs that we subscribe to. The key is to
<i>
 realise
</i>
that. So it becomes not a question of trying to get to a state where you hold no beliefs, no, it becomes an exercise in being very careful about the kinds of beliefs you take on board!
<br>
<br>
Changing your beliefs quite literally changes your physical reality. You will hear many spiritual "new age" types talking about how true change comes from within. Yes, that is true. But do these people actually know WHY that is the case? Not really. It is because your perception is creating your reality, not merely viewing it as virtually all people assume. And, as I say, the main factor that is heavily influencing of your perception are the core beliefs that you hold.
<br>
<br>
So again, it's not a question of dropping all beliefs, it's a question of only taking on board the core beliefs that influence our perception in ways that are beneficial, both to ourselves as individuals and to society as a whole.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I'm still learning about all this stuff, but I don't have much time to study.  When I get very tired or when I've been having insomnia I start seeing shadows, geometric shapes (like boxes in the middle of the road!), etc. and sometimes hear various sounds.  Could this be an "overlay"?
<br>
<br>
<br>
(By the way--as an aside--One day when I was really sleep deprived after I had my son, I had just put him down for a nap when I started REALLY hearing voices, loud and clear.  I could pick up words here and there too and just started freaking out thinking that I'd need to call my husband at work and tell him to commit me!  Well, turns out that the baby monitor was picking up the neighbor's phone conversation.  Whew!)

<section>
Your perception creates your reality and is heavily influenced by your beliefs. You cannot get around that. So the only real choice you have is to monitor very carefully the beliefs that you take on board, so to speak. For your beliefs are, in a sense, creating your reality. So in true terms, if you don't like the reality you are creating then change your beliefs. It's a little more complex that that, because we do have interactions with others we need to take account of. But that's the basics of it.
