<section>
I posted my introduction message in the main "Welcome to OBE Discussions!" forum...Didn't see this forum until now...Oops. At any rate, I'm terribly grateful to have found this community as these are topics and interests closest to my heart.
<br>
<br>
I'm here to share experiences and learn alternative theories, ideas and techniques to conscious projection. I have a special interest in all matters of the UFO phenomenon. I've seen UFOs throughout my life, both night time and day time sightings, and can consciously recall one interface with a being I think was an Extraterrestrial.
<br>
<br>
I've touched upon all the usual suspects in my life such as psychic phenomenon, ESP, deja vu, premonition dreams that come true, sensing and interacting with spirits and guides and so forth. Growing up, I always assumed this was natural and everybody experienced these things all of the time. Boy was I in for a surprise as I grew to know better.
<br>
<br>
My current AP/OBE level: I use the "roll out" technique (usually early in the morning after hours of sleeping when my body is still asleep), can float around my room and so forth, but I have trouble with my astral vision and being more decisive and commanding with my thoughts. The best I have been able to do so far is command "Take me to the Astral Plane!" where I was immediately flying upward and through star fields and galaxies...It was amazing.
<br>
<br>
I want to incorporate the Brainwave Generator and other techniques to help in my progress. I have an insatiable desire for knowledge of reality and consciousness. Looking forward to communing!
