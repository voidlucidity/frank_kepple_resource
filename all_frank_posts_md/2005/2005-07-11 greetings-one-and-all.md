Greetings One and All,
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I was just cruising around the web, looking for some interesting sites, when I came upon this one.  Have read some very interesting posts and feedback, so thought I might join in!
<br>
<br>
I practice magic, but generally on a solitary basis, so it is nice to have somewhere to go and speak with people who have similar interests and varying background (makes for more ideas and points of view!).
<br>
<br>
Hope to get to know at least some of you, and be able to stick my two bob in here and there!

Thank you for the welcoming!
<br>
<br>
I tend to stick my fingers in many magical pies (so to speak)... work with whatever seems relevant at the time.   Use elemental magics, summoned spirits, candle magic, etc.
<br>
<br>
Are you a fellow magic worker?
