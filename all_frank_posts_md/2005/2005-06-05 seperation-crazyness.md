I have been ap'ing for a while and every time before last night I felt myself sink down deep and bam I was somewhere else, my eyes filled with images without me having to open them, fully engaged.  Last night I was trying to AP and having difficulties to say the least.  I tossed and turned in bed, changed positions, and just decided to go to sleep.  I lay there for a while, not able to sleep, and I thought "well... what if I am already out and just dont know it?"  and I pushed down with my hands on my bed and I STARTED TO FLOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have never had this happen before and have always waited until my astral eyes opened by themselves.  Was I always taking the hard route and have seperated tons of times without even knowing it?  I didnt have any exit sensations and it didnt differ from any other night that I have a failed attempt.  I am having to rethink my approach all over again!!!

Any input would be great.

Hi knightlight
<br>
<br>
That's very similar to my experiences.  I'd never floated upwards.  Either I went down, or rolled out.
<br>
<br>
The first time it happened to me, it was just like you describe -

- ha ha.

I loved the rising feeling so much, I just continued up through the ceiling, the loft and the roof of the house!!  I got too excited and lost it once I'd left the roof.  Even now, I don't float that often, but when I do, I love the feeling so much, I go with it.  I don't control it, I just float around the room like I'm lying on top of water - it's such a feeling of freedom.
<br>
<br>
BTW, I never get exit sensations, unless I specifically request them.

Eureka!  How brilliant!  I never thought of asking for exit sensations.  Thanks for the feedback.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
After looking into the matter of the "exit" for a while, and after experiencing all manner of "exit sensations" over the years, there is no specific need, in my view, for any particular sensations other than you are free of your physical body. It is quite possible to simply find yourself in that state merely by wishing it. But there are specific belief constructs that people typically hold that do get in the way. The concept of "exit sensations" does help to overcome concerns regarding the attachment to contrary beliefs. In a sense these sensations help to introduce people to the "out of body" concept in a time scale and in a manner that is acceptable to them.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

agreed frank.  I just seem to have come face to face with the fact that out of the last 100 nights I have had what seemed to be no success, I may actually have, but didnt know because I didnt try to fly, or simply because I believed myself to still be "in".  What if even 10 of those 100 had actually been successes!!  What if I keep "separating"  without realizing it and lay there in the RTZ  or F2 without realizing I am "out"!!!!!  I have only had one or two phasing successes and I hope to make it my permanent method as the switch is noticeable and obvious.  My transitions by my current method used to be obvious until now!  I can hit a state where I am peacefully asleep, snoring with my mind fully awake as if I am not asleep.  I actually spend most of my time sleeping like this, lets me get more things planned and straightened out.  In the past I would hit this state, sit there for about 10 or 20 mins and I would start to feel myself sink or vibrate or SOMETHING!!! and then I would be "out", now I feel nothing, and have felt nothing for the past month, aside from a rushing of energy and maybe a tiny bit of hypnagogic imagery now and then, or recently a bit of a rocking chair sensation.  It is just very frustrating to have the method that seemed to be the best for me turn into nothing but frustration.
