Just another hello my mystical name is raffles im 35 male. ive just got back into spiritual side of things in the past couple of months. been having a bad bad time with depression (which i now realize are negs) split with girlfriend, lost job around same time, ive also tried suicide twice in the past year. Feeling a bit better now, so i hope to be around for awhile.  Im gonna give energy work a go in my spare time, as anyone any tips they could pass on ?
