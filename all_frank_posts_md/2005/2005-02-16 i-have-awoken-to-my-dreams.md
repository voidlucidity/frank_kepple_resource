Hello all. I've read about lucid dreams and the like for many years off and on, and practiced some meditation techniques. Although I've never actually attempted to enter a lucid dream, I have on occasion realized I was dreaming and been able to take control of it with moderate success. And at some point in my life I seemed to develop a very strong natural control over the energies in my body, making relaxation techniques very easy and powerful for me, from relaxing a part of my body, to almost being able to shut off the tactile perception of my mind. Now I think I'm ready to attempt a voluntary lucid dream, and I've browsed and read a few topics on this site, it's all just a bit overwhelming right now, trying to understand these techniques is difficult enough at this point, but with the added problems of terminology it's a little hard to understand what people are saying, is there any reference that would explain the different terms? I look forward to becoming an active member of this vast community, I just need a little help finding my ethereal sea legs.

Hi Terrorok
<br>
Welcome. It will probably take you a while to learn the lingo but there are some very good articles in the literature list and you can also do a search on different subjects.
<br>
<br>
Most people here have had hundreds if not thousands of Lucid dreams and may be further ahead, thats true, but so what
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
it really doesn't matter. This is your life and your experience, in which we play just the smallest of parts. I for one am glad to be even just that small part and help if you have any specific questions.
<br>
<br>
So good Luck and feel free to ask anytime
<br>
<br>
Regards Mustardseed

After reading some help topics on this site I found a link to
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://ld4all.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://ld4all.com
</a>
, this sight is like an all inclusive database on dreams techniques, biochemistry of dreams, and software to help LD. I recommend this site to any newcomer like myself, and I thank you for your willingness to help around here. This site really gives you the feeling of what Eamon Healy described as neo human development, where the collective exists to serve the individual, and perpetuate individual evolution. And therein enriching the collective in a non-direct, non-selfish manner.
