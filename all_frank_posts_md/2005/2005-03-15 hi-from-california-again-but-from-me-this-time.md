Hi,
<br>
<br>
I got into Lucid Dreaming in around 1995 when reading an article in Magical Blend. The article discussed Carlos Castaneda's 'The Art of Dreaming' which was quite inspiring. Since then I've read many of his books, but never managed to seriously be able to do much and have not devoted enough time.
<br>
<br>
I hope that will change this time around.
<br>
<br>
Nice to see such a friendly community. Hello!
