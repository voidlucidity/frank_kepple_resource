Hi,
<br>
<br>
See the forum bug section (under the thread PMs) regarding this situation where I moved this post.
<br>
<br>
Your post in API did go through I think.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The error does come up but if you look then the post may well have been made. I just tried posting and got the error, assumed the post had not gone through and tried again about 6 times and got the error each time. Then, going back to the forum I saw that the post had in fact been made each time I'd pressed submit and got the error.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
