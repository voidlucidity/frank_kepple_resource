<section>
OK, I don't have much time to review the other posts here right now.  I hope to this weekend perhaps.  Anyway, here is my story.
<br>
<br>
I've been having lucid dreams for years now, since I was in high school around 8-10 years ago.  They usually come in waves, many around the same time and then nothing for months.  I have probably averaged around 15-30 a year I guess.
<br>
<br>
Well, recently I think I've been having OOBE.  I have read there is a relation between them but I don't quite understand.  The reason I think I've been having OOBE is because they just feel different than a dream.  Here was the first one:
<br>
<br>
I am laying in bed after "waking" from a dream and sit up.  I feel strange and think, "Hmmm....I think I just left my body!"  I could see the room and it looked just like it would if my eyes were open and I was sitting in bed.  No cord, no glow, just the room.  Suddenly I'm fully concious and awake laying in bed.
<br>
<br>
The others I have been in the middle of sleeping, but they are not part of a dream (I always remember my dreams).  These are freaking me out because I have "met people" in the dreams/OOBE or whatever they are.
<br>
<br>
The first was a baby sitting in my hall way crying.  The baby was about my daughter's age, I'd guess about 8-9 months old.  I was afraid because he looked like a ghost but I couldn't stand to see him (I say he but I don't know if it was a boy or not) so sad and felt compelled to pick him up.  When I did he stopped crying and I felt so much love and pity for this baby.  Then he disappeared.  Shortly after I woke up feeling very numb in my bed.  I also had the sensation of someone touching me but I was not afraid.
<br>
<br>
The second was last night.  I was at my mom's house, though I don't know how I got there.  There was a man on the couch and we were talking about a ghost he had been haunted by.  We were having a nice conversation and all of a sudden this angry "presence" came.  It hurled me up in the air and I "fell" back to the ground.  I was not hurt and I could not see my "attacker" but I felt it was male and he was trying to intimidate me.  I was afraid he'd do something else but he didn't and might have left the room for all I know.  I was scared and for a moment couldn't wake up but after a minute I did.  I felt numb again and started praying over and over again, "please God, help me, I'm scared" over and over again.  Then again I had the sensation of someone touching me gently.  The touching again did not frighten me.  I felt that I needed to go wake my husband who was laying on the couch.  I was calm at this point but was starting to get a little nervous again as reviewed what happened.  I felt I needed to get up while I was still mostly calm and when I did my husband was awake.  He said he had been startled awake by a sound in the kitchen right before I came out.  It was really weird because he usually sleeps through anything!
<br>
<br>
Both times I felt someone was trying to give me a message.  Like a moral.  It is weird because I never had this happen in my dreams in the past.  The first time I woke up thinking, "There are people out there who need love." the second time, "There are people out there who hate you".
<br>
<br>
I don't know how much I believe in this stuff.  Maybe I don't want to believe.  But I do know what has happened and I'll admit I'm a little afraid to go to sleep tonight!
<br>
<br>
Well, gotta go get lunch for the kids but I will check back tonight.
<br>
<br>
My questions are:  Should I be afraid?  Does anyone know what is going on?  I am NOT trying to have these dreams/OOBE, they are just happening.  Can I get hurt?  Is this common?
<br>
<br>
TIA,
<br>

Don't know if it matters, but I felt vibrations upon awakening each of these times.  I often wake up feeling those same vibrations and numbness upon awakening, even if I have not had a lucid dream.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This question comes up often so you'd be best looking through the FAQ section and doing a search through past posts. One thing you find in this state is all your fears become objectified as you are entering realms where thought equals action. So you tend to come across scary circumstances. But it's just your own release of fear that's causing it. Or if you prefer you can go down the "devils and demons" route. In which case the PSD forum would be your best bet.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I don't have a lot of time to look through the FAQ but I will try.  My baby is napping right now but I don't expect she'll be down long this late in the day.
<br>
<br>
I browsed quickly through the "are OOBE just lucid dreams" post just now.  I'm guess I'll never really know what happened then?  How frusterating.  I just kind of want an action plan if it happens again.  I'm thinking just to be safe if I have any kind of lucid dream, OOBE, etc. I'm just going to try to wake up.  Sounds like the best plan to me for now!
