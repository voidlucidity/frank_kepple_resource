<section>
Forgive me for not introducing myself.
<br>
I should explain that I have been doing these things
<br>
since I was very little. I don't know much about books or terms on
<br>
dreaming or OBE's . I learned dreaming and OBE from the need to go there.
<br>
<br>
The only time I ever talked about these things before was a small
<br>
dream workshop when I was a teen where we just learned about
<br>
journaling and things like that (I never told them anything about my
<br>
dream walks/OBS's, or seeing in dreaming) And then to a very few select friends I have recently met.
<br>
<br>
So, I have experience and fall short in the ability to explain
<br>
things. It gets interesting sometimes trying to converse, but I am
<br>
glad to be with a group like this...And Robert's books are the first I have on the subject. So far it all makes sense. I am learning new things every day, and learning that I'm not alone (which is the best thing!)
