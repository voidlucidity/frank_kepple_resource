<section>
I have very mixed feelings about you people testing astral projection.
<br>
If you are to test astral projection, then allow me to be an advisor. I have been watching the military test astral projection for sometime now. I have just found out you people are testing it too. I'm a little wired, right now. I have sent a member request, with the name of Misazeno. Let Misazeno in. I won't let you become appart of the militaries research. They are monitoring your site.
<br>
<br>
LET ME IN... If you have read my introduction in this forum, you will have seen my experience.
<br>
<br>
Please take this into consideration.
<br>
<br>
Members of this forum, long time astral projectionist, people who escape to the world of the planes....
<br>
<br>
The military of America is testing out astral projection. Now another group is testing Astral Projection. Do you want the world of which you work and suffer to spread to the world of complete freedom? Let these who threaten our way of lives be crushed under there own weight of tyranny. Help the meek and ignorant, for they will be our soldiers against the on coming threat.

I think Above Top Secret is a joke, like basically every theory there. Everyone ends up creating these completly off-the-wall conspiracy theories; I think its nothing more than a subjective playground.

Take a chill pill mate, there is no American military conspiracy or government infiltration of this site; if only people took us that seriously, we'd be laughing!
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the cold hard reality of the matter is that as far as most people are concerned, including the political/military world, we are just another bunch of internet whackos! In fact, the idea that they are even aware of us at all is pretty far out!
<br>
<br>
Stay calm, relax and take a deep breath (not sure if that's the right order, but something along those lines

I at least appreciate your concern, but you have to understand that from all of the time that I've been here, I've read nothing to suggest that people can do any harm to others via the 'astral' or etc. without those target people tricking themselves into causing their own problems. 'Curses', 'black magic', etc. are the closest things I've heard of, and those are as belief-based as the placebo effect from what it seems to me. Nothing else will 'hurt' anything. The absolute worst they can do is some sort of recon, and unfortunately they've had military ESP programs up and running for at least the better part of two decades, so that's really nothing new. If you want something to worry about, figure out what the next terrorist attacks are going to be using. Now

This is rich.  I cant stop laughing.  I really dont see how monitoring this site will help the government use astral as a weapon.  It would take a long time for the government to teach a group to astral project at a level of complete control and to use it against others.  And its not like they can force someone to project even with drugs.  I should stop talking now, they might be listening in.

I was going to post the picture right into this post but I figured it would be moderated. Nonetheless, you should see it. I know you didn't mean anything by it really, but it's hardly a joking matter when so many innocent people are burned alive for no damned reason, and then people remark that the government would never harm their own citizens. Give me a break; I hope you weren't serious when you said that. You might also want to look up something about Ruby and Ridge and even 9/11.
<br>
<br>
And what's worse, we've already been told by high-up officials (ie, willy Cheney) what the next 'terrorist' attack is going to be: crude nuclear detonations in cities. In Cheney's own words, it isn't a matter of 'if', but 'when'. It may be easy to joke about now, but I have a feeling that it won't be a joking matter for much longer. Hopefully you won't be eligible for the draft when that happens, either. And I really hope you like Bush, because you'll be seeing a lot more of him.

If you want to know the true story about Waco get the DVD "Waco:  The Rules of Engagement".  You will never look at your government the same again.    Very powerful movie, it even won an Emmy Award.

There's nothing to fear but fear itself. Fear is the control mechanism. Buying into the lies they would have you believe (and seems most have since a certain date based on an event that was falsely engineered to cause fear) is just the ticket to make the powerless a little more powerless. They are not the enemy, they are lost souls. They've lost their souls to greed and power-lust. Hating them is pointless because on a spiritual level, hate breeds hate. Love breeds love. They are shooting themselves in the foot with every step they make. We need to let it be enough that they're making their own beds. They will never run the spirit world because it runs on something they know nothing about- love. We need to focus on our personal world, to live and grow as best we can regardless what they've turned the world into. Knowledge is good till it turns into paranoia. That's a mental sickness fearmongers have. I should know, I was one. When we get to the place the head games they play with us don't work anymore we can evolve into a world we're happier with.

Hhhmmm interesting.....to the people who find the idea of the government using AP ridiculous you should probably try researching remote viewing. Btw the (RV) program was supposed to have been shut down some time ago, but in reality they are still running it, just from a different place and with different admin. And given the obvious level of success, and that RV was impossible to keep the lid on once out, its more than likely that various militaries are quietly looking into other psychic skillz.

 LOCKHEED X-22A ANTI-GRAVITY FIGHTER DISC
 <br>
 The Lockheed X-22A antigravity fighter disc fleet, equipped with Neutral Particle Beam directed-energy weapons, and capable of effecting optical as well as radar invisibility, is deployed for worldwide military operations from the new U.S. Space Warfare Headquarters.
 <br>
 <br>
 A-17 EXPERIMENTAL STEALTH FIGHTER
 <br>
 Generally regarded as a fourth generation low-observable design, the A-17 is believed to have evolved from the YF-23 Advanced Tactical Fighter, and will replace the F-111 Fighter Bomber. The YF-23 lost out to Lockheed's F-22, but it's technology could easily be adapted for use on other projects. No positively-identifiable white world pictures exist of the plane, but sightings have been reported at RAF Boscombe Down in the UK, and Cannon AFB, New Mexico.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 THE SUPER VALKYRIE HYPERSONIC BOMBER/SPACEPLANE
 <br>
 Operating under the mysterious Aurora Project, the system is believed to comprise a spaceplane roughly the size of an SR-71 spyplane and a hypersonic launch vehicle resembling the experimental XB-70A strategic bomber designd in 1957-60. This large aircraft could perform a number of roles, but it appears to have been designed specifically to carry the smaller spaceplane to a suitable launch altitude.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 AURORA HYPERSONIC SPYPLANE
 <br>
 Does the United States Air Force or one of America's intelligence agencies have a secret hypersonic aircraft capable of a Mach 6 performance? Immediately recognisable by the pure delta triangle airframe and the Donuts-On-A-Rope contrails, this aircraft is rumoured to conduct regular flights to the secret "Black" space stations orbiting the Earth.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 X-15 ROCKETPLANE (USAF PROJECT MX-1226)
 <br>
 Late in the year of 1954, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) issued a requirement for an air-launched manned research vehicle with a maximum speed of more than Mach 6 and a maximum altitude of more than fifty miles. North American Aviation Incorporated was awarded the contract for the new research vehicle, the X-15 Rocketplane.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 F-117A NIGHTHAWK STEALTH FIGHTER
 <br>
 The F-117A Nighthawk is the world's first operational aircraft designed to exploit low-observable stealth technology. The unique design of the single-seat F-117A provides exceptional combat capabilities. About the size of an F-15 Eagle, the twin-engine aircraft has quadruple redundant fly-by-wire flight controls. Air refuelable, it supports worldwide commitments and adds to the deterrent strength of the U.S. military forces.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 F-22 ADVANCED STEALTH TACTICAL FIGHTER
 <br>
 The Lockheed-Martin F-22 Raptor represents the greatest advance in fighter-aircraft capability in 50 years. It brings the largest increase in sustained speed since the advent of the jet, flying most of its missions at speeds other fighters can only attain for short periods. The F-22 Raptor can also, using its advanced thrust-vectoring system and supercruise capability, accelerate and maneuver at speeds today's fighter jets struggle to maintain in a straight line.

 UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FUTURE WEAPONS PROPOSALS
 <br>
 Projects outlined briefly as part of the USAF's Air Force 2025 study. Known as the "Future Weapons", areas covered include hypersonic attack aircraft, defensive satellite systems and laser-based weaponry.
 <br>
 <br>
 AIRSPIKE - ABILITY TO CREATE SAUCER-SHAPED HYPERSONIC SPACECRAFT
 <br>
 The concept would offer designers the capability to actively control the external aerodynamics and thermodynamics of an advanced trans-atmospheric vehicle by substituting directed energy for mass - typically in the form of a sharp nosed structure.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 ELECTROCHROMATIC "INVISIBILITY" PANELS TESTED AT AREA 51
 <br>
 The electrochromatic panels are comprised of thousands of tiny sensors that function as video-cameras that take images of background scenaries, transferring them to the other panels on the other side of the aircraft. This gives the illusion that the aircraft is almost transparent. What the ground observer sees is whatever background images behind (or above) the body of the aircraft that are transposed to the "observer's" side of the body of the aircraft.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 PULSE DETONATION WAVE ENGINES
 <br>
 One option for a hypersonic vehicle might be four or six Pulse Detonation Wave Engines (PDWEs), fuelled with liquid methane. As air breathers, these PDWEs could theoretically propel a hypersonic aircraft towards Mach 10 at an altitude in excess of 180,000 feet.

 <br>
 DONUTS-ON-A-ROPE CONTRAILS
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 PULSEJET - EXOTIC PROPULSION DESIGN
 <br>
 Pulsejets use the forward speed of the engine and the inlet shape to compress the incoming air, then shutters at the inlet close while fuel is ignited in the combustion chamber and the pressure of the expanding gasses force the jet forward. The shutters then open and the process starts again at a high frequency.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 STEALTH TECHNOLOGY
 <br>
 The Stealth program aimed at designing high-performance military aircraft incorporating, among other features, a minimum of metal and with the exterior clad in highly absorbent tiles. The aircraft would be almost invisible to radar and could make most radar-controlled anti-aircraft systems obsolete.

Interesting......
<br>
<br>
But on what basis do you believe what would otherwise seem like humorously-falsified rubush? I am sorry, but it sounds as though a 12-year-old wrote these.... even the phrasing is redundant, and sounds like a computer game.... "antigravity fighter disc fleet, equipped with Neutral Particle Beam directed-energy weapons".....
<br>
<br>
not saying it couldn't be true, but its sounds as plausible as an invasion of toast monsters which have secretly replaced our old models with top-secret military tech for replicating their kind.... I think a little proof is in order

the government doesnt even need to go to the astral plane to come up with stuff like this.  I believe that they are probably working on this stuff but I dont believe they managed some strange way of getting stuff from the astral to use on these weapons.  The government comes up with some insane ideas for new military weapons all the time, much like the ones posted here but that doesnt mean they are even making them or have gone past the planning stage on any of these.  Even if they did make them so what?

You are right, no_leaf, the issue is not about making this topic a laugh-in, but rather to explore the reasons for its existence- namely, arcaneis's insistence on the validity of this above-top-secret material; we are not in the business of rejecting beliefs outright, for that would preclude this site even existing, but if one if going to make such a bold claim, which seems to invoke non-sense as its justification, I think there needs to be slightly more proof- that is all; until this proof is forthcoming, I am not sure what the author is trying to bring about, but I suppose that is his/ her perogative....

Yeah, that would be perfectly reasonable. If he can't prove what he's saying reasonably to us, there would be nothing wrong with letting the topic sit.
<br>
<br>
What we have instead are members ridiculing him and making ageist suggestions, ie everyone that's 12 or 14, etc. must automatically believe something ridiculous out of a comic book or video game if they come to this forum. And you are quite right:
<i>
 everyone
</i>
coming to these forums believes ridiculous things! It's all a matter of perspective, and none of us are really in any position to call the kettle black. If we were, then I wouldn't hesitate to note how certain members here are almost allergic to thinking outside of the box when it comes to anything but spirituality, and how their mental functions have become as stagnant as if there were nothing else for them to possibly learn (which is clearly not the case).
<br>
<br>
But that shouldn't be a problem. Just lay off, already. Arcaenis didn't come here to be mocked and ridiculed. Let him present his case to us; his proof.

The Government used Ft. Meade Md. as one training base for soldiers training to remote view.  The project was called Stargate if I recall correctly.  Also there was one Officer that was in the program that dropped out after the Pam Am flight crashed over Lockerbie Scotland. He said after projecting there he encountered many of the spirits of the just departed and it really freaked him out.  I also read the book Above Top Secret and the Air Force soldier was not informed he was in communication with Astral beings but communicating with Alien Beings.  He was also informed that he had the ability to use the equipment on a psychic level as he was abducted as a child.  He dose describe the layout of the base correctly as I was there. I kind of suspected he might have just been misinformed if the story is true.

Unless of course the Stargate program was real...and...err... there was a Goa'uld involved - Nirrti - you know the cute looking Goa'uld that has the personal invisibility doodad, and experimented on people to try and create some kind of super-human. Most of them ended up psychic, or dead.

The government remote viewing programs are not the same as the television show 'Stargate'; they only shared the same name, and the government used it first. Considering parts of the RV program were at one time open to the public, I don't think they really compare as to which is more of a 'fantasy', either, unless you think Stargate (the television show) was a documentary. o.O

I could seriously imagine a similar mockery of the AP over at their forums after one of our more unique members signed up there to tell those guys about how they could use psi-balls to blow up the world, DBZ-style. After all, a quick glance at their forums shows they have over 40,000 kooks, as compared to our 9,000 or so. So they're bound to have more nut jobs running abroad I suppose. A visit to their forums shows that doesn't seem to be the norm there, at least. But I guess ignorance is bliss, and no one needs the devil's advocate to have a good crack or two at the kooks, lol.

ironicly enough, that was the theory behind project stargate, but the problem they had was that the individuals they were investing so much funding in were continously dropping out due to personal conscientious concerns, and so they could not hold onto any talented prejectionist for long; there are rumors that a similar program now exists, but I am not sure of their validity, although I
