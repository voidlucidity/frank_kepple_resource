Greetings all.
<br>
<br>
This is mainly a question to Frank but i would love to hear for anyone else too, with experiences within focus 4 or any other focus.?
<br>
<br>
The reason i ask this question is because these kind of stories serve as great inspiration to myself an hopefully other newbies starting there journey's.
<br>
<br>
For instance i was reading one of Franks post and in it, amongst other interesting experiences he mentioned becoming the colour blue. After reading the post (and his newsletter) i can't tell you how inspired i was.
<br>
<br>
So anyone here on the Astral Pulse please share your experiences, no matter how mind blowing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You don't want to get me on the topic of Focus 4. It's too whacky, it's too wild. I wanna get people projecting to Focus 2 and then Focus 3. But Focus 4, it's something else. One day I hope we'll
<u>
 all
</u>
write a book on it. Or at least that's what I hope.
<br>
<br>
In my teachings I'm putting aside Focus 4. That's your prize, as it were. The icing on the cake, the end goal. I'll direct you to Focus 2, show you the way to Focus 3 and then introduce you to Focus 4. I'll stand by you on the edge of the transition, even give you a little push, lol, 'cos that's me. But once you step over that edge you are on your own. That's the way Focus 4 is. It's not for the unwary. Your life will simply not be the same when you come back. This is no joke, this is Frank being very serious.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the quick response.
<br>
<br>
Although pretty new to all this, i can say with no doubt that IS my goal. I understand you wanting to stage the progression of peoples development, it makes sense. Although I always was a lad that liked to peek at his presents before Christmas hehee.

Will the Gateway Experience Wave I get me to focus 4?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Peeking at Chistmas presents, yep, that's me all over. I understand. But there is no short cut to Focus 4, please do not underestimate the Focus 4 experience. Like I say, this is Frank being serious. Focus 4 is just something else.
<br>
<br>
If someone worked at it they could be having F4 experiences within a year. I'm not saying it's gonna take mega time. Okay, they'd have to be a little dedicated to get that far in such a short time, but it is by no means impossible.
<br>
<br>
But please, realise, your whole sense of "body" is totally blown away. You will never, ever look at physical life the same way again.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Drew:

<br>
No the Gateway experience will not get you to Focus 4. Focus 3, yes.
<br>
<br>
The Monroe linear focus model of consciousness upon which the Gateway experience is based ends at the top branches of Focus 3, which is focus 27 of the Monroe Model. As I've mentioned a few times, it was my frustration in trying to go "beyond" F27 of the Monroe model that ended up in me creating a whole new model of consciousness that incorporated what we now call F4 of consciousness. But the Gateway series of CD's will take you a
<u>
 long
</u>
way. It's just that when you get there, I'll be waiting to push you over that "edge" that is F4. :)
<br>
<br>
So whether you get there through my methods or the Gateway CD's is irrelevant. Everything I did was based on the Monroe model so I support that model in addition to my own. After all, it's what I grew up with so I kinda know it inside out.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Certainly the dedication i know is there, so focus 4 within in a year, sounds like a challenge
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
Well any focus within a year is a challenge for me at the moment, but this is something i am determined to develop.
<br>
<br>
This Gateway experience sounds intriguing, unfortunately i know nothing of it. Is it something worth researching?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers

Frank,
<br>
I am curious.  You are leading me to believe that avhieving focus 4 prematurely, there is a possiblilty of going insane.  Did it take you a while to recover?

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
Focus 4 makes you insane, yes, with no hope of recovery. :)
<br>
<br>
Seriously, please no one underestimate the sheer gravity of a Focus 4 experience. Monroe was touching on it a few times. He gave me the clues, so to speak. Focus 4 experiences are one of the most profound experiences anyone can have in this system. All sense of "body" is totally disintegrated. You will not return from a Focus 4 experience as the same person who went. There is no turning back from a Focus 4 experience. You get to realise what your life is all about. Things that perhaps no one should know become known to you. You come back realising the truth, the stark truth. Every belief you have ever believed in, every known that you have ever known just gets zapped.
<br>
<br>
In a sense it makes you realise what is truly important.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

To me F2 sounds mind blowing enough! Never mind F3 or F4 hehee.

Hello....
<br>
<br>
actually, I don't know I think focus 4 is so interesting Frank because of what you said... the fact that you find out truth.  I hope to get there some time myself.  I'm still working on phasing or obeing.

This thread has the most info about F4oC that I have come across:

Also, according to Frank there aren't any "lesser" focuses - they are all equal.

Frank i agree..
<br>
I think im on a borderline....
<br>
I need you help so much
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
I changed awhile ago... It not just something that is "what-it-is"
<br>
It can not be put in to words.. I been turning all around to find out how to make this last step... Been reading alchemy and been around these forums looking.. This has got me a little further i think.. It is not like i am me.. It is not at all like "astral feedback" it is like i am what i am but not...
<br>
And I'm realizing so much at the same time... Like in situation i just seem to discover why and how.. But it is not me discovering this.. It is just "there"... OBEs seems so lesser to me sometimes i think this is why I'm on some kind of borderline´but probable not to FoC4. But to something..
<br>
I hoped i could talk to you over instant chat or something but i know you have less time. I think many people during the last 2000 year have touched this subject but they have been taking their interpretations...
<br>
That's why i like your work so much
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
It is scientific sorta.. Well you know what i mean.. It explains to you how to acctualy "do-it"
<br>
<br>
<br>
I just cant express these thing like you can...
<br>
I will be waiting pantialy for more news-papers

dude, i have to get a credit card if i ever wanna get this book.  There's no way on earth (or any other realm/focus level, whatever) that anyone I know is gonna let me get it (though I'm 18 on Friday so then we'll see who has more control)
<br>

<br>
P.S. I've only have mild phasing experience, mostly in FZ.  And then everything else is just spontaneous projections.  I think its odd though, putting F4 into words, though I've gotten to that stage (or even close), I find that everything else is hard to explain.  You'd have to invent another language to cope with these new experiences, there's an idea!

I have no idea of how this focus things work even though I read some things about it but didn't pay much attention since I've never heard people talking about it over here in my country.
<br>
<br>
From reading your posts I can share an experience I had recently that I think might fit into this level of consciousness:
<br>
<br>
I went to bed wanting to try a different form of exiting my body. I imagined a mirror on a ground way above me so that I couldn't see it, but I had to know it was there and that's where I needed to get. At some point while drifting off to sleep I saw my reflex floating in black and white, but then something happened that I can't quite explain, I lost my body. I was spinning but there was no me. I found out I was a spinning circle, traces of green, purple, red and yellow lines, they formed this traced line that was spinning on a white surface, that was me and I didn't exist.
