I was raised a catholic and believed there was life after death.  IE heaven, hell, and whats in between (purgatory).  Several years ago, when i was id say about 14.... i just stopped.  I didn't listen anymore.  I didn't believe anymore.  God, the devil, heaven.... i just didn't believe it was there.  All i thought there was for me, was quiet darkness.  After learning about astral projection (about a year ago) i started thinking again, If one could leave his body (projection) something beyond any type of scientific explanation, there is very much a possibility of life after death.  Not as many perceive it to be, the place in which one is rewarded based on his life on this physical world.  This is a place we all go to, to reside as long as we please until we feel it necessary to commence another life on this earth.

<br>
So what do you guys think is out there?

As I understand it, the Astral Plane is just one place we move onto upon physical death. There are spiritual planes beyond and higher than the Astral Plane.. We progress to those planes as we are ready; or we reincarnate on the physical plane..
<br>
<br>
A lot can be learned from reading the amazing OBE experiences that people like Robert Bruce and Robert Monroe have had. Another interesting thing is to read many of the near death experiences that people have had.. a lot can be learned about the Afterlife from OBEs and NDEs..
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the ancient admonition to "Know Thyself" answers our questions about the reality of life after death. Before we have understanding of ourselves as a spiritual being, we are just caught up with our physical identity, and we may even doubt the reality of an Afterlife. But as we learn about our spiritual bodies (which are just as real as our physical body) and planes of existence that lie beyond this 3rd dimensional reality, it becomes clear, that life does not end or begin here..

for me personally, my vision of heaven is an uncorrupted   and endless desert, where i crawl and climb forever the moon is full and gorgeuos the sun rises once every 2 weeks, I could fly higher than the birds into the stars or dig deep into the caves of the earth and the temperature would always be perfect and my perfect lover she would be there and we would be the two iron dragons, our scales covered in gold so that we shimmer in the moonlight,
<br>
never hungry never thirsty, never sad, we would be the master and mistress of the desert. that is my idea of paradise.
<br>
<br>
so it is my reality so it shall be.

<section>
well my vision of heaven IMO, is like when you sleep.usually you don't retain any conscience even though u might be AP.
<br>
so yes heaven for me  is like the lack of individual or group  conscience   of being alive

I, personaly, cant wait till the end.  How glorious that would be indeed.  Calm, quiet... no worries, hurts, or sorrow....  But what if thats why were here?  Because we wanted to worry, to hurt.  I hate it, why would i choose something like that?

Hello:
<br>
<br>
The only problem I have with the "life after death" construct is the death part. There is no death. You simply remove yourself from physical focus. It's something you choose to do. But, unfortunately, in an objective sense, this is still viewed as "death" but there is no death, lol. It's just a construct people choose to engage in. One day people will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about. He he, remember, you heard it first here on the Astral Pulse.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
