<section>
Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
I've been interested in OBE's since I was a teenager in the 80's. Like most of you, I'm sure, I started out by reading all the books I could lay my hands on - Monroe, Castenada, Lobsang Rampa, Muldoon and Carrington, etc.
<br>
<br>
I started experimenting and found I could get into the hypnagogic state quite easily. I could "command" the swaying sensations at will. But unfortunately that was it... I couldn't go beyond that stage. The furthest I got to was when I once sunk into a very deep trance, my body was completely numb, the swaying was very strong and I heard loud and real popping sounds... then it stopped. The pull of my physical body was too strong, and my mind, being somewhat paranoid, could never really "let go" for fear of losing control (I would never make a good hypnotist's subject). It was a threshold that I never managed to cross.
<br>
<br>
I soon lost interest. In the following years I tried to project on and off again but never really made a serious effort. Yet there was this persistent desire to project nagging at the back of my mind.
<br>
<br>
Recently I started reading posts in this board, and the posts about phasing in particular caught my interest. It seemed easy enough for me since I could enter the hypnagogic state at will. Together with some BWGen presets I started experimenting. Sure enough I was having a lot of interesting experiences, some of them quite profound. The progress I was making was quite astonishing, to say the least.
<br>
<br>
My initial attempts were limited to getting accustomed to the new states of consciousness and just exploring familiar surroundings. Among the places I visited were:
<br>
<br>
- my grandmother's house in another country.
<br>
It felt real, I felt like really being there. I walked around the house and could feel the ground under my feet, the warmth of the sun on my skin, etc. (my feet and skin here are of course astral counterparts created by my mind, as theoretically only my consciousness was projected). I noticed details which I usually don't pay attention to, like the grass in the garden, the texture of the pavement etc. Curiously, I couldn't see anybody. Looking up to the balcony, I saw a white furry puppy sticking its head through the railing and looking down to me. It had a “happy” expression and was wagging its tail, like any small curious puppy. This is odd as my grandmother doesn't own a dog. It could have been one of my guides taking the guise of a puppy to avoid surprising me.
<br>
<br>
- a cliff in Turkey overlooking the Mediterranean sea.
<br>
I was there on holiday several years ago, it was a peaceful and magical place and I've always wanted to return. Again, phasing there, it felt real. I could feel the vast expanse of space and air in front of me, the turbulent sea below, the wind blowing, the sun above etc. Above me to the right I could sense a being floating in mid air (I didn't look up to it). It's a bit difficult to describe - it was non-human, benign, had a somewhat rounded form, its aura was "neutral", meaning that the energy was not overly powerful or weak. It wasn't really interested in me... it was just floating there. I had the impression it has been there for a long time.
<br>
<br>
- to the past to a cafe, which has been demolished years ago. My grandfather used to take me there when I was a small child and I've always had fond childhood memories of it.
<br>
Phasing there transported me back to exactly how it was - full of people eating, talking, etc, the laid-back atmosphere as if time stood still, etc. The amazing thing was that it reminded me of all the details I've long forgotten - the worn chairs, tables with marble tops, high windows, white wall tiles, the staircase in the kitchen, the big metal freezer at the wall, the metal gate at the rear which was always open, etc.. I remember them all clearly now because I've
<i>
 been
</i>
there. It was like it still exists.
<br>
<br>
However it was when I started asking for my guides that my subsequent experiences took on a much more profound character. I'll write them in the next post.

<section>
Thanks for the kind words Frank. I'm happy to share my experiences with everyone. Hopefully they will motivate everyone to embark on the journey to find their true selves. I believe my calling is to guide people along the correct path of progress, and help them discover themselves the real purpose of being in the physical realm.
<br>
<br>
Here's an account of an early phasing session. At that time I was still unsure, so the experience was a short one. I'll omit the relaxation and visualisation method I use, but if anyone is interested I can describe them in detail.
<br>
<br>
&gt; I am floating in the 3D-black void. It feels peaceful. I feel safe here because it's like my own private space. I don't see the stars others talk about (not at the moment, however in my later phasing sessions I do). I stay afloat for a while to experience the new environment. Then I think out loud, I would like to meet my guide / one of my guides.
<br>
<br>
On my right I sense a tunnel made of the same material as the 3D-black void... hard to describe, but it's not overly important. I travel through it and at the end I find myself standing on a path in a beautiful countryside. It's daytime with bright sunshine. I can feel the earth with small stones below my feet. On both sides of the path are meadows with tall grass, beyond them dense forests with tall trees. From the vegetation it seems to be located somewhere in Europe.
<br>
<br>
I walk along the path, looking at the scenery. It's calm, peaceful and very relaxing. I sense life around me, but can't see them (no birds, animals etc.). It's just like walking in the countryside in the physical world. After a while, someone comes up along the path in front and runs towards me. He's male, around 20-30 (?) years old, rather short. He seems to be expecting me, and by running, to be happy and excited to see me as well. When we meet, I immediately feel this strong bond with him, as if he's someone I know very well and haven't met for a long time.... just like when you meet an old friend. There is an undeniable sense of trust between us. He says (telepathically) that they are waiting for me, and leads me on along the path.
<br>
<br>
Walking on, I see a group of five to six people on the left, sitting in a circle on the grass. They rise up and come to greet me. The leader (?) is a somewhat elderly man, but he is strong and has a confident walk. He's dressed in a long white robe. I think his "old" appearance and robe are more of a symbolic nature, meaning he's advanced and experienced. He smiles and says "It's nice to see you again". I feel this deep sense of love coming from him, as if we're "family", I've been away long and have now come home. Behind him are the others - adults, I think around 30-50 years old, male and female. They also greet me warmly as a group. They seem to know me well, yet I find the whole situation odd, and also a bit uneasy, because I have no idea who they are! But somehow I have the feeling I belong to the group.&lt;
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately at this point my energy level was getting low and I started to lose concentration. I remember we sat down and talked a bit, but I can't remember what it was. My attention was wavering and I drifted on and off into a dream state with nonsense hypnagogic images... I did the visualisation method in reverse and woke up. I checked the discman - about 30mins have elapsed.

<section>
The method I use is not much different from the methods described by other posters. In fact my visualisation method is based on the one outlined in Gandalf's post
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=18264&amp;start=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=18264&amp;start=10
</a>
<br>
<br>
I usually do my phasing in the morning after waking up. I'll go to the bathroom to empty my bladder, return to bed, lie on my back and get back into the half-asleep state. Sometimes I put on the earphones of my Discman with a BWGen CD. In the beginning BWGen presets helped me attain the mind awake / body asleep state, but now after having had enough practice I sort of already have a "feeling" for the trance state and don't need the presets anymore. Still they're useful for shutting out outside noise.
<br>
<br>
I take a few deep breaths to relax my body. If I have chatter in my mind, I visualise a box where I put in my chattering brain, close it and put it aside. Then I take ten deep breaths, with each breath I count from 10 to 0. This is a very common method used by hypnotists to put their subjects into trance.
<br>
<br>
10... relax.. 9... relax... 8... my body feels numb... 7... i'm falling deeper... 6...5.. deeper... 4... still deeper... 3... relax...2... 1... my body is asleep.... 0
<br>
<br>
I visualise my body to be filled with my "life liquid". Starting at the feet, I "withdraw" this liquid leaving behind the empty shell of my feet. Then I work my way up, withdrawing the liquid from my legs. I find this method to be very effective because as the liquid is withdrawn from my legs, I actually lose the sensation of them. The empty shell left behind is totally "empty". I continue up with my hips, torso, arms, shoulders, neck etc.
<br>
<br>
Finally the liquid is only left in my head. I visualise it decreasing until it becomes just a point of consciousness. This point is then "pushed" out through the brow chakra. This effectively causes me to lose sensation of my physical body. I find myself in a black empty space.
<br>
<br>
In front of me I visualise a big circle made of blue neon light. As I pass through it, I can sense the glowing neon around me. It "screens" out my physical aspects and I emerge on the other side as a body composed of lots of tiny sparkling stars, which I can actually feel. This step is important - it symbolises filtering out the physical and entering into the higher planes as pure consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I visualise a door opening with very bright white light. As I enter it, it filters out the "heavy" sparkling stars, now I'm made up of only the very fine ones. I find myself in a bright space permeating with pure white energy. I can feel the energy passing through me... it's very fine and "clean".... I become merged with the energy... it charges me... it's a wonderful feeling. Sometimes this space is an orb and I can see the walls made of white transparent "plastic" with a glowing aura, sometimes it stretches to infinity.
<br>
<br>
Then I visualise a door opening in front of me, behind it is black space. I enter it... all remaining sparkling stars in me are filtered out and I'm just a single point of consciousness.... and, tada!.... I'm in the infamous 3D-void. When I first read about the 3D-void, it sounded scary as I had the impression of a dark and empty space. But it's not. It's very calm and peaceful, like staring at the night sky on a silent night. It's like my own private space. I feel very safe because no one can intrude.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I see the stars / points of light in the distance, sometimes I don't. If I think out loud my intention, one of the stars becomes brighter than the others. I enter it and find myself then in the place I want to phase to. Sometimes I sense a tunnel made of the 3D-void (which is a paradox as the 3D-void is empty) instead and going through it will bring me to the destination. Thinking out loud in the 3D-void is quite fun as you can actually see your thoughts transform to real 3D words in front of you.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This may all seem like some ritual but it's not. Going through a course of action gives my mind something to actively participate in, and helps to keep it from wavering. Also I find it helps me get to the 3D-void rather quickly. As soon as I go through the last door, I'm already there. Sometimes I linger around in the white orb. It's very pleasant, it's a feeling I can't describe in words. Remember, phasing should be fun!
<br>
<br>
To return from phasing, just do the visualisation in reverse - reverse out of 3d-void, close door, reverse out of white orb, close door, neon circle, fill back body with liquid, count from 0 to 10...etc. I tend to go through this stage quickly because I'm usually in a hurry to get back to the physical and write down everything before I forget them!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding your question about remote viewing and phasing, although they both share some common similarities, they are quite different. I'll list out the similarities and differences for you so that you'll understand them better (I'm by no means an expert in RV and the following is what I've gathered from reading. Anyone who has experience is welcome to add more information).
<br>
<br>
Similarities:
<br>
In RV and phasing, the person enters into the mind awake / body asleep state while still in his/her physical body. S/he can still feel his physical environment (e.g. the bed s/he is lying in). The physical body is numb, there is little sensory input. Attention is withdrawn within, and the consciousness is projected to another place (not in the physical or spatial sense, but to a higher plane / frequency).
<br>
<br>
Differences:
<br>
<br>
RV
<br>
The person sees events unfold in front of him / her on a screen, in the darkness, etc. It is like watching a movie or a succession of images
<br>
S/he is a neutral observer not involved in the events s/he is viewing.
<br>
S/he has no control over the development of the events.
<br>
There are no sensations like touch, warmth etc although there may be sound.
<br>
There is no communication with the characters in the events.
<br>
<br>
Phasing:
<br>
The person is actively participating
<i>
 inside
</i>
the events
<br>
The environment s/he is in is unmistakably real.
<br>
S/he has sensations like touch, warmth, sound, etc.
<br>
S/he can interact with the people s/he meets, ask questions and get answers.
<br>
S/he can make decisions that affect the development of the events, e.g. in my previous account, if I had chosen to ignore the person running towards me, I may not have met the group later.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It would be more appropriate to compare phasing with OBE as they share the same traits. They're two different methods leading to the same goal (the projection of consciousness). RV and phasing may be similar methods, but they ultimately lead to different goals (RV is passive observation, phasing is active participation in the events).

Hi juicywatermelon
<br>
<br>
Your posts are wonderful - thanks for sharing.  I particularly like the method you use to get to the 3D void.  I've never consciously experienced the void, and I know it's something I will enjoy, so I'm going to experiment with your method and see what happens.

I have always had this question about OBe's.
<br>
<br>
Well you know how you might have been in the house all day and decide to go for a walk, and you've been walking for X amount of time and when you get back home you feel like you are refreshed and satisfied that you've gotten away from home for a while even though you only have a memory of it?
<br>
<br>
Do you feel that way when you come back to your body from an OBe, or is it more like waking up and feeling like it was only a dream?

Hi Sarah,
<br>
<br>
you can call me by my name, John. I'm sorry if I come across as an anonymous poster. I've just noticed I've forgotten to sign off my posts!
<br>
<br>
I'm glad you like my method, but credit should be given to Gandalf (Thanks, Gandalf!). Do give it a try, it's not that difficult to reach the 3D-void at all. It's not a mystical place reserved for the elite, it's your very own private space in the universe. You may have been there yourself without realising it. The first few times I was there I thought I was still in F12. There were no signs whatsoever, no stars, etc. Next time you find yourself in a dark space, don't worry if you're in the 3D-void or not. Just voice your intention and you may then see the stars or sense the tunnel... then you'll know you've suceeded.
<br>
<br>
Actually, to tell you the truth, the 3D-void is not that particularly exciting. It's, well, just empty space. For me it's nothing more than a stepping stone to get my destination. I don't linger long in it. I prefer to linger in the white orb instead which is very pleasant. It's like "heaven". I always feel recharged after visiting the white orb.
<br>
<br>
I've always wanted to write about my experiences since I started phasing, but put it off due to laziness. I aboslutely find typing a chore. However there was always this persistant nagging at the back of my mind (must be one of my guides). Anyway I'm glad I've taken the first step now and hope my posts will inspire others to try it for themselves. It has changed the way I look at life, e.g. I take life less seriously now. Although when I watch a movie where a character dies and everybody cries, I keep thinking, why are they crying? They should be happy because he's going to a better place!
<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I wish you good luck!
<br>
<br>
John

<br>
First of all, let me clarify that what I'm doing is phasing, not OBE's. An OBE is projecting your consciousness
<i>
 outwards
</i>
together with your astral body, whereas phasing is looking
<i>
 inwards
</i>
and projecting your consciousness from there. Both approaches ultimately lead to the same goal, i.e. the shifting of consciousness to another plane.
<br>
<br>
I would say it's more like your analogy of taking a walk. Let's take the example of me phasing to my grandmother's house. I was clearly aware of what was going on and I participated actively in the events. It felt real - I could feel the sun on my skin, the ground beneath my feet, etc, just like it feels real when you are taking a walk. When I returned to the physical, I had full memory of it, just like you have full memory of your walk. I was aware of what I've done or experienced, and I wrote the experience down.
<br>
<br>
But there is a difference, though, in the way the memory is brought back. When you come back from your walk and sit at your desk to write it down, it's a continuous flow because all the time your consciousness was in the physical. Whereas coming back from phasing, there is a transition of your consciousness from one plane to another (i.e. from a higher to a lower frequency). As the phasing memories are of a finer frequency, they are more "fragile" and can be overwhelmed by physical thoughts. Therefore I have to suspend analysing it and try to remain in the half-asleep state while writing them down.
<br>
<br>
You can look at it the other way round too. While phasing, I sometimes have a hard time trying to recall something from the physical, e.g. my original intention of where to phase to, because I am now in the phasing consciousness while the intention was formed in the physical consciousness. If I try to hard to recall it, I'll get zapped back to C1.
<br>
<br>
Regarding your question of a dream: If I dreamt of my grandmother's house, upon waking up I wouldn't be aware of what I dreamt of because I have no full memory (unless it was lucid). It's only when I try to recall it that the details start coming back, usually in a reverse order.
<br>
<br>
Personally I don't care much for dreams. I'm not discounting them entirely but there are too many factors involved (your daily thoughts, your physical mind trying to comprehend something unusual by translating it to physical terms and skewing it, influence from other people's stray thoughts etc) that the end result is totally warped and devoid of any meaning.
<br>
<br>
Years ago I used to have recurring dreams of my father in various situations. I would try to analyse it and find out what it meant. It was only later when I dreamt of him again, the dream turned lucid and he "melted" away to reveal another character that I realised all the while my physical mind has been superimposing his image on the characters. So these recurring dreams didn't mean anything at all!

<section>
Phasing is a very natural thing to do. It's nothing more than shifting your consciousness to a higher frequency. We all do this to a certain extent when we daydream. Phasing is just going one step further.
<br>
<br>
When you are involved in physical activity (e.g. reading this post), your consciousness is 100% in the physical. When you daydream, your consciousness shifts a bit so it's, let's say, 80% in the physical, 20% in the higher planes (these are arbitrary values). When you enter F10-12, you may be 50% physical, 50% higher planes. During phasing, I would say it's 10% physical, 90% higher planes. Looking at it the other way around, it's like being in the higher planes and daydreaming about the physical.
<br>
<br>
Even when I've gone very deep into a phasing session, 5-10% of my consciousness is still in the physical world (e.g. I can hear outside noise, although very subdued). I suppose only an OBE is 100% higher plane (including RTZ for that matter). In phasing only the consciousness is shifted, whereas in OBE the astral body is projected together with the consciousness. Unfortunately I'm not an OBE person. It would be nice though to be totally out of the physical body once in a while though.
<br>
<br>
If by reading my posts anyone gets the impression I've perfected the art of phasing and can do it at the drop of the hat, it's not true. I'm still in the learning phase. Sometimes my attention wavers and I find it hard to concentrate. Or my mind chatter will intrude.
<br>
<br>
Basically the success rate depends very much on my energy level after a night's sleep. If I wake up groggy and tired, I find myself drifting off to a dream state or worse just fall asleep during phasing. If I wake up very fresh and alert, I find myself too anchored in the physical world and have a hard time projecting my consciousness. I would perceive more of the physical world than the higher planes. If I'm going to have a busy day ahead, I might as well just forget it. My mind chatter would be annoyingly active.
<br>
<br>
So it's a matter of luck really. The ideal state would be half-asleep yet mentally awake. Sometimes a week would go by without reaching this state, sometimes it happens every 3-4 days.
<br>
<br>
Of all my phasing sessions I would say about 30% turn out to be profound experiences, 30% are normal / nothing to shout about, and the rest not successful (I fall asleep or get distracted by some outside noise, etc).
<br>

Here's a quite profound phasing session. This was several days after the session related above. The (?) at certain parts of the text means that I didn't or couldn't quite register the detail as either my concentration was wavering, or I wasn't paying enough attention (e.g. when you enter a room for the first time, you may perceive there's a sofa in the corner, you may notice it's white but when you try to remember more details later you find that you didn't pay enough attention to it). Also sometimes I find the more I try to analyse some detail, the more "blur" it becomes. Trying too hard seems to be detrimental.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Floating in 3D-void. After forming my intention to meet my guide, I sense a black tunnel on my right. I go through tunnel, there's a white screen at the end. There's some sort of image (?) on it but I can't make out what it is. I go through the white screen.
<br>
<br>
I find myself at the edge of a tropical forest. The trees are big and densely grown together. I seem to be in South America (?). I walk along the curved path that follows the edge of the forest. It's strewn with branches and leaves. Soon I come to a barrier, it's a giant thin wall of "plastic", slightly-glowing with cyan energy (very hard to describe in words because it doesn't exist in the physical world). It seems to stretch very far right and left, cutting through the forest on my left. It's like I'm in a giant box and I've reached the cardboard. It looks impassable, so I turn back. (In retrospect, it seems odd that I just accepted the barrier without question and turned back. For some reason the wall didn't seem out of place to me.)
<br>
<br>
I arrive back at my starting position. In front of the forest is an energy form - a vertical oblong of glowing white transparent aura, and filled with white light. In the middle, inside the aura, is a diamond radiating with energy. I can see all the colours of the spectrum - red, blue, green, white, etc - coming from the diamond, yet they all blend together in harmony. The diamond emanates an energy both powerful and pure, yet "soft", meaning it's pleasant and doesn't overwhelm me. I concentrate on the energy, trying to figure out if it's male or female, and can feel both male and female vibrations.
<br>
<br>
I look at myself and notice I'm not radiating energy like the energy form is. In fact, compared to the energy form glowing brightly in front of me, I don't seem to be "switched on" at all. I think, if s/he can do that, I can do it myself too. So I will the frequency of my body to increase. It takes me some effort and a long time (?) until I start to glow. I finally manage to "match" my frequency with his/her frequency. But looking at myself again, I notice I don't have the diamond inside me.
<br>
<br>
I understand the energy form is my guide and I ask his/her name telepathically (I just think of the question). S/he replies it's .....(?) but I can't catch what s/he says, so s/he repeats the name. Only after repeating three times that I manage to understand - "K..."
<br>
<br>
I ask K a few personal questions about my family and relatives. The second question concerns a relative I'm very close with, and K says we share a common life strand / evolution line (?) and that we were related / know each other in a past life.
<br>
<br>
I ask two more questions, but unfortunately I start to lose the "grip" on the situation. The scene is wavering into a dream-like state, and the last answer doesn't make any sense. I try hard to concentrate and ask two, three more questions about how I should continue my life... I get strange answers... now I'm really losing grip and everything's jumbled up.... sinking into dream state. I do the reverse visualisation and wake up back in the physical. I write everything down in my log book before I forget them. &lt;
<br>
<br>
This early phasing session shows the difficulties I had in communicating telepathically. It was all new to me. I've never done it before. In later sessions I began to practice more and my abilities gradually improved.

Hi everybody, sorry for the long absence. I've been very busy the past month. I went through a major crisis in my professional life and had so many things on my mind that my phasing activities had to be put on hold. Anyway, now that thing's have improved somewhat, I hope to get back on track.
<br>
<br>
Continuing from my previous post, some of my phasing experiences don't tell me anything at all. Here's an example:
<br>
<br>
&gt; Slept well, full of energy. I have a feeling the journey will go well. Go past the neon ring. Enter white orb. I can feel the wall of white glowing energy, room is permeated with pure white energy. Enter 3D-void. Sensing capability has improved, can see it stretching to infinity. Want to visit K, try finding him but he's nowhere to be found.
<br>
<br>
I see a portal (it's like a square hole in space with scenery beyond it) and go through it. I'm standing on a clearing in front of me is a massive-looking timber house. The windows and doors have wooden coloured frames with carved ornaments. I have the impression the architectural style is Japanese (?). The mood is sombre, like a shogun's (?) house. I peer through the windows but it's empty and dark inside, as if it's been abandoned. I try to open the door but stop. I somehow feel uneasy about the situation, although I don't sense any real danger. It's just that the house seems deserted and I feel like I'm intruding.
<br>
<br>
I turn around and leave the house. Across the clearing is a small shed. I turn to the left and continue walking. I look for K but he's nowhere to be seen. I realise there's no point staying around here, so I phase back to C1 by doing the visualisation in reverse. Time elapsed: about 30 mins &lt;
<br>
<br>
The next day, the phasing session was more successful, although K showed me something I didn't understand and subsequently dismissed (maybe I'll understand later the rational behind it).
<br>
<br>
&gt; Rested well, feel good and alert. I go through the visualisation steps and I'm in the white orb. It's refreshing and I feel recharged being here. It's difficult to describe the white energy in words - it's pure and clean, very pleasant, yet neutral, meaning it's just "there" and nothing happens. I play around a bit, I change the white energy to cyan and back. Below I see a sort of city with towers (like a crystal city) made of the same white glowing energy. I descend onto it, it's empty and there's nobody / nothing around. I find a portal in front of me, go through it and find myself in the 3d-void, stretching to infinity in all directions.
<br>
<br>
I call out to K, and K appears in front of me, again as the vertical oblong glowing aura with the diamond inside, radiating with energy. I feel the strong sense of affinity to K - K is me and I am K. I enter K's white aura and find it easy to do as I am also glowing at the same "frequency". We are both within the same aura, enveloped by the energy. I notice I am also an energy diamond, exactly like K. We are the same person / related / friends / part of each other.
<br>
<br>
Next thing I know, I find myself in a scene. I am inside a dark wooden chalet looking out through a big rectangular window to a Swiss (?) countryside with pine trees. The scenery is familiar to me, it is similar to the woods in my previous journeys. There is a path of grey white earth, leading from left to right. To my right, diagonally at 45 degrees, the path slopes down the hill to a forest of pine trees in the distance.
<br>
<br>
K is standing on my left. K appears in the form of a man in the 30's, european and of athletic build. This is the first time I see K take on a human form. (In our subsequent meetings, whenever K decides to appear as a human, this is the form K would take on again).
<br>
<br>
K says "Let me show you something". We fly over the countryside and land on a grassy clearing. Again, feeling the grass underneath my feet, it never ceases to amaze me how real the experience is. We are standing beside a construction made of raw concrete. It is a free standing abstract sculpture representing the architectural form of a house. The walls are represented by a single vertical slab of concrete whereas the roof is hinted by just the outlines. Although I'm an architect by profession with a strong interest in art, I can't make much sense of it or find it terribly interesting.
<br>
<br>
I say "This is boring, let's talk about something more important". We sit down on the grass on the hill slope, overlooking the countryside. Our conversation went on like this (I've left out the details as they are personal) "I" is me.
<br>
<br>
I: What should I do about the problem concerning .....
<br>
K: Be patient, it will take care of itself.
<br>
I: When?
<br>
K: 2 weeks (this turned out to be true, although it was 3 weeks later).
<br>
I: Will my (new project) be successful?
<br>
K: Only if you work hard.
<br>
I: How?
<br>
K: Find other ....
<br>
<br>
At this stage, I can't remember what happened next. I lose contact and find myself back in the 3d void. I reverse back to C1 and look at the clock - 30 mins. &lt;
<br>
<br>
During my later conversations with K, I realise they would usually follow the same pattern. K would never give a straight answer. K is never judgemental and never says what I'm doing is wrong, or that I have to change this or that. If I want to quit my job and backpack around the world for a year and ask K whether it's a good idea, he would say something like "If that's what you desire, then go ahead".
<br>
<br>
From K's answers, I realise that the life I'm living is mine, and I can live it the way I want. The reason we're here on earth is to learn and gain experience. Ultimately it's up to us to make the most of it. There is no right or wrong. I can be a couch potato and watch TV the rest of my life, nobody would stop me but then I wouldn't have made any progress in my evolution. Whatever I do, it's my own decision and responsibility, and whatever I want to achieve, I'll have to do it myself. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what we do, it's the experience and what we learn from it that counts.
