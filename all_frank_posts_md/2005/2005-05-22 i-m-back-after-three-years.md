I hope this doesn't post twice. I seem to be having trouble remembering how to post on this forum. Sorry.
<br>
Anyway, I found this site three years ago and was having quite a good time with it when everything in my life went wacko! So, I just bookmarked it and now I'm grounded enough to come back and take up where I left off. The website looks even better than before. I'm glad to be back!! I'm looking forward to learning from each of you, and perhaps sharing a little of my own background along the way!

Are you using the same name that you had three years ago (I'm sorry about not recognizing your name if you are.) or have you started again with a new name? Either way, welcome back.

Wow! Frank, I remember when you disappeared.

This is really funny because I left the forum and take a peek back only once every eight months or so. Glad you're still out there, and I probably won't see a reply because I don't intend to peek back again for a while.

Best,
