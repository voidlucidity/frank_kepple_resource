Hello. I have been here for a while... lol, but I figure I need a proper intro.
<br>
<br>
I am 16, I live in the US, and I have been training on matters of AP and OBEs for the past 2 years.
<br>
<br>
I am in the middle of a spiritual struggle, mostly between good and evil, but also trying to find what exactly I DO believe... very frustrating. (Hoping AP and guides can help me clear some stuff up.)
<br>
So far I believe in reincarnation, mostly because I received a picture of the ouroboros, specially drawn, and a book on how to astral project, which eventually led me here. The owner was anonymous, however I believe it was something in a will from a past life to somehow hand down the previous knowledge so it wouldn't be lost in this one... maybe I need it?
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I swim, weight lift, sing in chorus, Sing in a band, play in the school marching band, jazz ensemble, play the piano, and model... woo. My favorite experience was singing at Carnegie Hall this past month (march) as the featured choir. I will never forget that.
<br>
<br>
I figured I would use this thread to introduce myself and maybe use it as a "Nathan's Thoughts" thread for epiphanies and quotes I may pick up that strike me harder than others.
<br>
<br>
Today's quote: "The secret to success is to be like a duck; smooth and unruffled up top, but paddling furiously underneath."
<br>
<br>
And my epiphany for today: The entire world happens inside your head... we just pick up on it with what we have been given to do so...

If I remember well Pratchett wrote that in one of his books...

Welcome to the forum, hope you like it here and you manage to sort it all out in the end. "Good and evil" is one of the more popular constructs that people subscribe to. That and Victim/Perpetrator are perhaps the most popular two.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
