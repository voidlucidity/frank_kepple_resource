Even though nobody has responded to my previous 2 experience posts, I am going to keep posting them in the hope that it will help a fellow newbie (and so I feel like I am contributing to the board instead of just leeching information).
<br>
<br>

<br>
7:20am – 7:54am
<br>
I woke up around 6:35am due to my girlfriend's alarm clock. I got up and let my dogs out and tried to make sure I was fully awake. I wrote down the dreams I remembered and then I laid back down at around 6:50am, put on "Super Sleep," and tried to phase. After a while my body was getting sleepy and I saw some images in the distance. I wasn't able to keep them for a long period and I decided to get in a comfortable position and attempt a lucid dream. I have had a goal that in my next lucid dream I will draw a door and write "F3oC" on it and walk through and (hopefully) this will take me to Frank's F3oC. I remembered to set my intention, so I set the intent to go to F2oC and let myself drift off.
<br>
<br>
1st
<br>
I was at S.M. Park in a dream when I realized I was dreaming. Things went black and I didn't have a clear goal in mind (since everything went black I couldn't try my door trick), and I started moving backwards as if someone was slowly pulling me. I decided to go with the flow, even though it was scary. Apparently I am getting braver because I am allowing these things to progress longer, even when things happen that I don't expect. I stopped moving backwards after a while and I could see something faintly out of 1 eye, and I made the mistake of opening my physical eyes as I tried to see what the scene was. This ended this experience.
<br>
<br>
The next 2 were interesting because I wasn't fully dreaming when I became lucid. It was almost a pre-dream as I caught myself non-lucidly talking to myself.
<br>
<br>
2nd
<br>
I was non-lucidly having some imagined conversation with a coworker, but did not have any other dream sensations. I became lucid and was careful not to do a "body check" to test if I had bodily awareness (since it would snap me back). I saw nothing but a black screen and I asked to visit my higher self. The sense of movement was there again (moving backwards?) and I demanded "clarity now" and all of a sudden from the distance I see these yellow creatures that looked like Pac-Man with clothes on (I think there was a Pac-Man cartoon when I was a kid, that is what it looked like – a 3 dimensional cartoon of  Pac-Man). They were everywhere and were surrounding me as I moved through them. I could also hear the sounds from the Super Sleep CD that I was listening to, although at the time I didn't know where the sounds were coming from. I thought for a bit it could be F4oC, since there were a ton of these things around, but I have no way to know that. They all seemed to be spread out evenly, and it reminded me of a picture I saw once of "Indra's Net." I got a little worried, since these things surrounded me but I tried to control the fear. After a short while I regained awareness of my body and the experienced ended.
<br>
<br>
3rd
<br>
I caught myself pre-dream again and was careful not to do a body check. Everything was black and I carefully moved my non-physical arms and started twisting around. It felt neat being able to move around with my arms tingling. As I was trying to wriggle my body free I heard a woman yelling in the distance in my right ear. I had to deal with the fear issue because I got the feeling she was yelling at me and couldn't tell if it was my girlfriend in real life trying to get my attention (she was in the apartment getting ready for work). I decided I better check to see if it was her, so I roused myself and woke up. It turned out that it wasn't her, so next time that happens I will try and ride it out longer.

It appears that getting up before I need to get up and staying awake for a short bit, along with setting my intention, are really helping me to begin having these experiences.

Thanks for the tips.  Cool experiences too!  More fuel for my fire.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The thing with experiences posts is people read them and think, hmm that was interesting, make any mental notes to themselves they feel significant, and then move on. In other words, they read it but don't necessarily comment. I certainly read your post with interest and no doubt others did too. So I wouldn't take the lack of actual response as any kind of indication as to the actual worth of your post(s).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
