Why is it a bad idea to kill yourself? I am f'ing tired of this human existance and I'm f'ing tired of being lied to every day and watching all of my race assist in carrying out the Illuminati Agenda. I know what some will say, "YOu will be thrust back into a similiar situation because the point of existance is learning through reincarnation." Well who says we need to reincarnate? I have seen people discuss the possibility that we are not only manipulated here, but in the spirit world as well. That we are tricked to into the trap of reincarnation. Well what if I just end this physical body and instead of reincarnating become one with everything? I don't see any reason to not commit suicide, I don't have to follow any 'spirit' rules of reincarnation. Because if I do, then is there really any free will/freedom anywhere?

Who ever said life was going to be easy? Existence isn't easy. Life is struggle and if the illuminati and other like-minded people have grown so powerful, it's only because many people have a selfish, lazy attitude about life.
<br>
<br>
Turn off your television, log off the Internet and go for a walk in the park. Listen to the children laugh and play. Listen to the sounds of life all around you. Do you want to let all the dark, evil people get their claws on this without a fight?
<br>
<br>
Aside from that, you may want to seriously consider going to see a doctor about your depression. There are a lot of good people in medicine and psychiatry who know what they're doing. Even a simple 911 call will put you in touch with many kind and caring people who are prepared to help. They're not evil people. They're good people who may find themselves trapped in a corrupt system.

<section>
there is freedom but free will??? its an illusion.  You have the right to make a choice, but you can only make one.  The illusion is that the other options are open to you.  If you are given 3 options none of them matter but the one you pick and you can not re-pick.

We probably are manipulated by evil spirit-like things, like a farmer grows his animals just to harvest them. And manipulated by others that arent evil. But that should not matter. Do you want to be here OR where the spirit-like things are? People will threaten you with burning in hell, reincarnating as a worm, and other guesses, but you can find religious books that say the opposite. They're both guessing. Its a GAMBLE. Think of all the time, if any, you've been outside your body. Think of how much a newborn baby would understand about our world in the total of all that time, almost nothing. It doesnt know it will have to pay child support for an accident it has 30 years later or any of the other things that suck about this world. Thats how little we know about the other place. You know whats here, and very little about whats there, but you probably think you'd prefer one over the other. Will you gamble your consciousness?

I also see where you're coming from, 'If it's so great outside why stay inside and do homework?... for a subject i probably will never use again'.. that attitude is the reason I dropped out of highschool.. stupid me

<br>
But why not try to make your own better world, I'm not sayin change this one completely, but start something. Even if it's a small group of people, things can grow if put into motion properly.
<br>
<br>
I think this world needs as many people that can see it's being controlled by evil powers as possible. Why not stick around for a while... see what happens.

<section>
So suicide is what, a permanent solution to a temporary problem?   What MJ-12 said is true that life is basically hard.  I have spent many days sitting and listening to people talk about there problems and regrets.  Many people take the easy step to drink and use drugs to mask the hurt and fear of life.  Alcohol I call liquid sunshine because no matter how dark the day seemed the sun always came out after that first drink.  You have to begin to feel comfortable in your own skin.  Try joining the Boy Scouts or doing volunteer work at a local hospital.  Get a dog and start jogging.  I still have many days where I would like to just get drunk and forget about things but life can be nice also.  I had my best friend commit suicide about three years ago.  The ones left were hurt the most, his daughter and mother and brothers.   As to what happened to him afterwards I can not be certain but have theories that he regretted the decision to end his life.  I read a story once about a young man who was having drug problems and decided to hang himself in his parent's back yard while they were out.  Well he did and exited his body through the top of his head and all his attempts to get back in failed.  He then had to stand and cry in the yard as his parents returned and found him.

<section>
heter, i dont know where did you get that info about illuminatti or conroling people/mind in this world or in the other world.
<br>
<br>
what the hell do they control? nothing. Even if they exist they can control politics and maybe be the reason for wars but they control our mind. These theorys that USA has secret weapons to control mass population minds are lie. At least, i feel in my deep that they dont control anything. Some guys may counter argue replying that is natural: i dont feel controled because that weapons are so good that we cannot feel the control!
<br>
<br>
This is such a big f****** lie!!! These are theorys built on nothing! So, iam free and i am able to be happy, no one is controlling me. Even if some secret bastards control politics is that reason for suicide? No!!
<br>
<br>
In the past i was someone near of the suicide too. Then i realised that i had the power to be happy. Its complex and would take too much time (that i dont have) t explain how did i jumped from a suicide state to a energetic state. Basically i can tell that buddhism helped me a lot, plus some other situations that i was able to deal with in my life. Besides that i used NLP (neural language programming) without knowing that i was using that. Finally (but not less important) doing nice things with your friends its a grea thing. Do you have friends? Oh! dont forget to do some sport or physical exercise because helps a lot.
<br>
<br>
And search help within a profesisonal help. No one here (i speak for me) is able to give you help. What we are doing its just some tips. YOu need a therapy probably, thats normal.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope i could be useful.

<section>
On the off chance you don't have friends (and if you have a lot, just 4get this upcomin suggestion), the best way to have fun is to do something YOU like BYYOURSELF. Dont feel pressured that 'to have fun you have to be with other ppl and share the experience.' It is true, that it's a lot easier to have fun when there are other's to share it with, but if your a 'loner' then i'm sure you have things that are fun for just you (i dont mean drugs and stuff if u do that) but more natural things.
<br>
<br>
'FUN' is not a control method used by the illuminati to manipulate us all. Some kinds of fun are, but many kinds are not.
<br>
<br>
If you are doing something 'fun' and just letting go, or loose for a little while, you aren't helping the illuminati. You will never be able to achieve high goals if you aren't interested and excited about achieving them. As in, if you dont have a certain amount of 'fun' in doing them, they will never truly work out.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 True life is infinitly long, and what was the point of your spirit having you live here in the first place? To learn lessons. I doubt one of the lessons your spirit wanted you to learn was 'to kill yourself when things dont look good.'
 <br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
Unlike all the above ppl, i think for you heter, therapy is not gonna help a bit. The 'cure' for your 'depression' is all inside yourself. I think your depression maybe be spawned from self-doubt. You must be sure within yourself, but at the same time be willing to change if the right information is given.
<br>
good luck

<section>
Heter, i partially agree with you on the friends matter.
<br>
<br>
In order to get happy with others, in order to live in society, you must learn how to be happy when you are alone and with yourself, but thats a work that you need to do after your depression/suicidal tendencys get to a point where you can handle with it. Thats what i´ve done in the past. After my depression get lowered i needed some time to be alone and learn to be alone. I got sucess because my mind was focused on that instead of being focus on sadness.
<br>
<br>
Now, when i speak being with friends i really mean that. Just be with them. Get new friends. Leave for somewhile (if you have them) friends that are computer-dependents or guys that are always speaking on ufos, conspiracy, illuminaty and the like. Most of the time these guys (if you knwo them) have some lack of social abilities.
<br>
<br>
What you need its some normal friends. Go out and take a coffe and night with them. Go play some soccer, whatever. Go see a movie. Get a girlfriend. You know, even if you have any great spiritual tactic, mind control technique, etc in order to help you with your problem, you need to stop for a while with that.
<br>
<br>
First stop everything that may be related with conspiracy, ufos, sipiritual evolution, meditatio, etc.
<br>
<br>
Now, for 2 weeks or so, try to have a normal life. Recharge yourself. When you come back to your spiritual studys (the ones that can set you free- if you have anyone) everything will be more easy because you are fresh and lucid.
<br>
<br>
If for any reason (for example when i am sick and get home for days) i study to much astral projection, to much meditation (without doing it), to much ufos storys, etc, i get a little tired in my spirit. I get a little..strange (not that word, something different from strange). So, after that time i really need to do "normal" things.
<br>
<br>
Unless you are really good with your mind (and if you were you would not be thinking on suicide) like a buddhist master or the like, dont dent the power of friendship and normal life.
<br>
<br>
Riding ib bike with my friends during day, go out at night in clubs and dance, playing squash, going at beach with my friends and meeting some nice girls
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
have done miracles in the past. Now i still dont deny such things (correction: now i do that even more).
<br>
<br>
Just look for the most emotionally stable guys in the forum: Frank for instance or Hans Solo. Do you know, they are happy. Do you know why? They are Don Juans that go out their with their friends, having lots of fun and chasing girls like any other group of friends! Do they stop studying these things (AP, Ufos, etc)? No!
<br>
<br>
About profissional help. Well, maybe heter has some reason, but you need to be careful. I was able to get out from my depressive state without help, but not every body its lucky.
<br>
<br>
If you seek profissional help, be shre that you went into a good doctor.

<section>
Yeah man, just try to do some stuff that'll keep you entertained. Maybe you can find a valuable personal goal and fulfill it for the benefit of society. Maybe achieve something in one of the arts or sciences or spirituality even and share it, or start finding a way to apply science to the metaphysical, etc. Or maybe just do stuff that only
<i>
 you
</i>
will enjoy. It may sound selfish, but given the position you're in, no kind-hearted person could expect otherwise from you.
<br>
<br>
The world's in a sorry state, and the more you learn about it the more depressing it is, I know, but killing yourself only makes it that much sadder. We need more heroic figures to defy the political and psychological sadism taking place, and be able to still enjoy life and have fun with it despite them.
<br>
<br>
Kazbadan, there's no 'secret weapon', per se. It's called
<i>
 psychology
</i>
. Why do you think some Muslims blow themselves up? It certainly doesn't come very natural to human beings to kill themselves and other people and be happy about it (or so
<i>
 we
</i>
would say, having not been submitting to the same conditioning they have been), but that's what carefully-planted psychology will do. And they don't just do that in the Middle East, either. It's no coincidence that the most powerful figures in the world are almost exclusively from a single bloodline, and even throughout all the revolutions in history, they have never been permanently ousted from power.

secret weapon? sorry but now i am a little lost. Are you refering to when i said something like "secret way to get you out from depressive state"?
<br>
<br>
Or are you talking about illuminaty and secret weapons to control the mind? If its the second option i dont believe in illuminatty s***. Really. MAybe there are some masonry guys able to control a small % of politics and money but thats all.
<br>
<br>
If is the 1st option: i know, its all about your mind. You need to analyse yourself and get some tools (meditation, whatever) in order to get better states of existence (well, these are shorts words for something that its more complex that what i said).

Heter, please i really need to know some answers in order to help you:
<br>
1) do you have friends?
<br>
<br>
2) if yes, are your friends "normal"? I mean, they cannot be freaky, like playing warcraft in PC for 10 hours in a row, or always with fear of the next step of illuminati, etc...
<br>
<br>
3) do you engage in normal activities daily? like sports, go at clubs, go for a walk with friends, etc
<br>
<br>
4) do you have any girlfriend, any good emotional relationship?
<br>
<br>
5) if not, did you ever had anyone?

<section>
Heter, I read your post and I guess I'm kinda wary of saying the wrong thing if you feel so disillusioned at the moment.  But maybe a reason for you being really into life is right around the corner - you don't wanna miss it!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Whatever else is going on or has gone on, no matter how weird things appear, you can use your time to make spiritual progress here and now.  Whatever spiritual tradition you are drawn to!  If you do that, in the future things can become better.
<br>
<br>
Maybe in your last life you thought 'Well what if I just end this physical body and instead of reincarnating become one with everything?' and here you are again.  How long could you be stuck in that rut without things ever improving?

1. Well by friends do you mean people I can see and hang out with in real life? Well, I have one friend.
<br>
<br>
2. No he doesen't beleive me and anything I say about spirituality and the illuminati. He has been brainwashed well. I don't really see him much anymore because of this.
<br>
<br>
3. No I don't do any of that. I can't go to clubs anyway because I'm 15, not that I'd want to go.
<br>
<br>
4. No.
<br>
<br>
5. When I was 13 I use to hang out with these 2 girls. I really liked one of them and ofcourse she did not like me back. But the other girl was 'in love'
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
with me. So it was a very emotional and dramatic relationship I had with them.
<br>
<br>
The reason I hate the Illuminati so much is because if they did not exist, we wouldn't have to deal with all this bull shite. We have been spiritually crippled throughout our lives, and only those who awaken ever find true spiritual enlightenment. Had these people never existed we would be in a much more happy and energitic state, basically a  higher energy frequency or 'density' and we would have alot more knowledge about spirituality and the meaning of life. We'd be free and not need to hide and fight through all these barriers they have put up for us.

<section>
How heter, well first off killing yourself will not show you how. youll need to get through depression before anything. one of the best things to do for yourself is to WALK or excercise. WHY? because exercise causes the seratonine (which makes you happy) in your brain to release. Your brain will then start to naturally produce more seratonine as you continue exercising daily. SO GET OUT of your chair right now and WALK around your block for atleast 30 minutes JUST DO IT and DO IT DAILY EVERY DAY WALK WALK WALK

Heter:
<br>
<br>
We are all one but we present these difficulties to ourselves in terms of separation.
<br>
<br>
I would like to explain this to you in person. But I have a hundred other things I must do. This is not to say that your cause is any less or any more important. It's just that we are all in the same boat. We all feel for you, yet at the same time we all have to make progress.
<br>
<br>
I doubt there is a person alive who hasn't thought about suicide at some stage or other in their lives. Depression is horrid and I would not wish it upon anyone. But you have a part to play. However insignificant you feel, you DO have a part to play. It just takes time, that's all.
<br>
<br>
I am 46 years of age and I never thought I would last beyond 20. When I became 20 then it was 30, and so on. I cannot imagine myself at 50.
<br>
<br>
Seriously, I look at myself sometimes and cannot believe I have lived this long. I tell you, the age thing is weird. It hits some people in weird ways, like me. In ten years time you'll be looking back thinking, wow, did I really think that? To you, now, ten years is like an age. It's not, I promise you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Compared to 'eternal life' this 3d existance is a grain of sand in a desert. Not even that. Not being in the 3d doesnt mean that it will be paradise and great. Do you truly konw, 100% what happens if you kill yourself? I doubt you do, and i doubt many people do... if any...
<br>
Like you've said in the past: our spirit put us here for a reason; to learn. I dont think the lesson your spirit wanted you to learn was 'take the easy way out of hard situations' or 'to kill yourself when things dont look good.'
<br>
<br>
In a generalization, please tell us WHY you are depressed. What causes that feeling that 'oh i'm depressed, i might want to kill myself.'
<br>
Is it your total fed-upness with the ignorance of most humans? Is it more, less, different.. what?

I would say the problem is not maintaining a healthy social life. I have the same problems at times. If a person doesn't maintain some friends and go out enough, they'll go insane/manically depressed. Humans are social creatures, after all.

Read again my tips. Use them. Use what Runlola said to you.
<br>
<br>
have a pet, pratice exercise, try to have more friends...
<br>
<br>
Speak with your parents if you have a healthy relationship with them. Maybe one go to the psic. doc. can be good.
<br>
<br>
About creating friends: try fo find a group a little different from you. Probably you are shy. What you need it sto find an healthy group of happy guys. Guys that pratice sport or that have a great way to deal with things. Your friends must be happy people. Thats the main rule. WIth my friends we are always playing with each other, telling jokes, saying funny things, doing nice things together (beach, soccer, bike, etc)...
<br>
<br>
Really avoid groups that can make you even sad. I´ve been there in my teen years. It was me and my friend against the world. YOu dont want too be against it, just living it. Its your home.
<br>
<br>
Why dont you join the scouts or a group/actvities, etc that its always on nature, doing camping? Thats very health too.
<br>
<br>
Just avoid that state of "i am weak". Dont forget to study some NLP (read my post in this thread on 1st page).
<br>
<br>
My 2 cents.

Runlola had the best point i've seen here yet.
<br>
Let go, relax, and enjoy nature.
<br>
<br>
Nature is one thing that has no ties to any illuminati agenda, and there is no conditioning or trap in the chirping of birds.
<br>
<br>
Walking in the park is not helping the illuminati. You are not walking in one of 'their facilities' by doing that. You are listening to children laugh (so what if they are ignorant, their laugh comes from the heart, without strings attached) and lifting spirits.
<br>
<br>
Forget about all things bad, just for a short while. Then you will be able to sort out those bad things in a managable way.

Until you're an adult you cannot have ultimate control over you're life. And because of that, it's common for teens to feel similar to the way you do. Hormones will distort much, they can be a rush...as I remember. Hang in there. Committing suicide is weak. You seem very intelligent for your age, far too intelligent to fall victim to yourself.

<section>
yeah heter dont worry, life can be great.
<br>
If you're not in to nature (which it sounds you're not and most teens arent) then create something.
<br>
<br>
Give yourself a project, like to keep myself busy i write music, work on art and coding for an online multiplayer game im developing, write stories.
<br>
Or even physically build something outside, that'll give you something to do, and a sense of achievement when you're done.
<br>
<br>
The illuminati may control politics, royal families, the media, and just about everything... but they dont control individuals.
<br>
<br>
Get a small group of individuals together and start something new... anything... open peoples minds to the illuminati (WITHOUT PREACHING!!!!) and just have fun.

I've become something of an unwilling expert on depression, including suicidal thoughts and feelings.
<br>
<br>
Right now, I am trying to cope with life's greatest sorrow--I'm a 28-year-old widow.  Until 2 months ago, I was looking forward to a long, bright future with the most wonderful man on Earth, a man I felt was made just for me.  Well, that future is no more.  It has ended before it began.  And now I feel like I have a good 50+ years of "Why the hell am I here, and what the hell do I do now?!" ahead of me.  I feel like I'm stumbling through the dark.  Everything is a big unknown.  I fear life the way most people fear death.
<br>
<br>
I often think about dying now.  I don't have "active" suicidal tendancies, but I do have "passive" ones.  I drive a bit more recklessly.  I'm tempted not to wear my seatbelt.  I'm not afraid to walk in lightning storms any more.  And if someone confronted me with a gun or a knife, I'd tell them to $@!% themself because they can't hurt me any more than I'm already hurting.  If, Heaven forbid, terrorists ever started something in my city, $@!% them too--I'd chase the bastards down and give them their comeuppances, or else die trying.  I'm not afraid of anything or anyone any more.  In a way, that's good, but in a way, it's also self-destructive.
<br>
<br>
Honestly, there's only one thing that is sure to keep me alive, and that is the fear that suicide will sentence me to Hell.  And that I will be separated from my beloved for eternity.
<br>
<br>
Now, I should say that I don't always feel this low.  It's really a huge roller coaster.  It doesn't head downward forever.  And I think I can say with some authority that it won't keep heading down forever, for you either, nor for any of us.  It has to get better, because no one can live for long with such suffering.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 My advice:
 <br>
 <br>
 1.  See a doctor.  Any doctor.  These days, they all know something about how to treat depression and anxiety.
 <br>
 <br>
 2.  Spend some time outside.  I know it sounds corny, but it may help more than you think.  For me, it provides an immediate high.  Maybe not a huge high, but enough to help me get through another hour.
 <br>
 <br>
 3.  Accept that sometimes, you might have to just take one hour, or even one minute, at a time.  Don't worry about tomorrow, or even all day today.
 <br>
 <br>
 4.  While you're here in these forums, give your mind something to gnaw on!  Learn how to phase or something!  Life is a lot more bearable when you can experience the universe that is much greater than the here and now.  And you know, you don't have to die in order to do it!
 <br>
 <br>
 5.  Treat yourself to something special and indulgent.  For me, one evening each week, I eat nothing but sushi and doughtnuts (not together at the same time!).  That may sound gross to some of you, but those are my all-time favorite slightly decadent treats.

I have suffered from depression in the past, and yes i have had suicidal tendencies. I am happy to say i am largely past this, which i am very thankful for now, i am also thankful i stayed here. When the only option seems to be death its hard to look else where. The advice here is good, absorbing yourself in nature is wonderful and a good thing to do, very grounding indeed and brings life into perspective. If you are angry, then all these replies will bug you even more and probably infuse your mood, i know they would of me, this doesn't demean the advice however. Equally all these assumptions of how you are feeling will undoubtedly get to you, i just did it then. I can't say more constructive advise than the others have said, get involved in nature, take walks, go out, talk to people if you are not very social ( I know it can be hard to strike up conversation) then the Internet is the next best thing, forums and forums full of people, whats better for communication if you are shy? what has been said in the replies here is very sound and will work to your advantage if you choose to take it.

My fiance was killed in a crash 2 months ago.  We were going to get married this August.  We didn't even have 2 whole years together.
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
<br>
So, yes... my pain is very great.  It's just astonishing what grief can do to you.  Body, mind, spirit all are affected.  And it lasts a long time for most people.  I can't believe I am having to deal with something many people never have to even think about until they're 2 or 3 times my age.
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I have lots of support from family, friends, my doctor, and my church.  Most of them have no idea what I'm going through, but at least I have people I can talk to.
<br>
<br>
And I'm not exaggerating when I say that this forum, and a few others, are real lifelines!  I'm so glad I found you all!  I can see myself devoting much of my life to pursuing things like astral projection.  Especially if it means being closer to my fiance.

Heter does not believe marijuana is bad for the body and person. He says he has seen proof that it is, if anything, good for the body because it raises awarness time thing (as in 'high')

I think that now the only thing you can do its to learn to live with that pain.
<br>
<br>
Tips like the ones i gave to Heter may be good but not help so much as to him. Only time will heal you.
<br>
<br>
When you feel better, you should buy a book called "Who Dies" from Stephen Levine. The best book that i have ever read about how to deal with death (from loved ones or our own death) and pain. Its a book of courage and love. Very beautiful indeed.
<br>

<br>
OrionsDream, the truth is that marijuana is not that bad for you. The tests done on it have been biased and unscientific (ie, pumping lethal amounts of cannibinoids into animals), and there's no evidence that it's really any worse than smoking anything. That's unfortunate for your case, I suppose, but I agree that drugs + depression = bad. I don't know if it's especially true for marijuana, but from what I've read with other psychadelics, it
<i>
 does
</i>
lead to suicide in some cases. Any drug that feeds off of your emotions will simply amplify whatever you're feeling. Dunno if marijuana is one of those types of drugs, but if you're not sure, then better safe than sorry I would imagine.
<br>
<br>
I still think the problem is social, and while going out and getting laid might not be a very reliable solution (nice, though, kaz. lol), hanging out with more people in general might do it. Go see a movie, or go eat out somewhere and laugh and have a good time. If getting something like that arranged is a problem in itself, then that'd be the next thing for you to work on I guess. :-/ It really should get your mind off things, though, and get you having some fun.

What's sad is that the state you and I are in are the illuminatis fault, and we dont do anything about it.

 My advice:
 <br>
 <br>
 1.  See a doctor.  Any doctor.  These days, they all know something about how to treat depression and anxiety.
 <br>
 <br>
 So I can take anti depressants that turn me into a zombie? Did you know that 95% of school shooters were on an anti depressant like prozac.
 <br>
 <br>
 2.  Spend some time outside.  I know it sounds corny, but it may help more than you think.  For me, it provides an immediate high.  Maybe not a huge high, but enough to help me get through another hour.
 <br>
 <br>
 This would help and I'm doing that in Turkey. But the trade off for that is that I get to see the man my mom betrayed me for and the reason she hasnt beena round for 5 years.
 <br>
 <br>
 3.  Accept that sometimes, you might have to just take one hour, or even one minute, at a time.  Don't worry about tomorrow, or even all day today.
 <br>
 <br>
 No, Ive been behind long ebough. I need to start doing things now before I keep convincing myself that I cant do it in the future.
 <br>
 <br>
 4.  While you're here in these forums, give your mind something to gnaw on!  Learn how to phase or something!  Life is a lot more bearable when you can experience the universe that is much greater than the here and now.  And you know, you don't have to die in order to do it!
 <br>
 <br>
 I know alot about projection and phasing I just dont practice it because I can't bring myself to dedicate enough time to see results.

Instead of getting into the habit of thinking i'm trying to 'beat you' or 'hurt' you in some way .. bc that wouldnt really make much sense... just accept what i say, and like you said- discard what u dont want and take what u do, instead of mocking me on these forums everytime i give my 2 cents.
<br>
Its sort of like something you said before -- something like: "i love how you insult me just to draw attention to yourself on these forums" or something. Your starting to act the way i used to.
<br>
<br>
Kadabra- medicine might be able to help.. some medicines like change chemicals in the brain or something that really do change emotions.. as weird as that is to believe. Maybe its not true, just what i thought.
<br>
<br>
anyway, why not 'walk in the park' now? You dont have to wait until you go to Turkey.. Are you afraid people you used to know/still do know will see you? I can understand that, and if thats true a walk in the park will just add more stress...
<br>
<br>
Please, just consider these comments, and do not dislike them.
<br>
- I am not trying to do anything but help you (i dont really see what else i could be doing...) -
<br>
<br>
and pedro, insulting air magick... dude... if you spent more then 5 min. on trying out fire magick i think you might find it.. useful.....
<br>
but i suppose you have enough on your mind now. pheraps after you are not depressed anymore we could work together on this magick.

Heter--Just what do you have in mind that we should be doing, if you don't mind my asking?
<br>
<br>
I work full-time at a prestigious institution of higher learning where people are always working to improve the world.  As a librarian, my entire profession is about serving others.  It's my gift, and a worthwhile one, I should think.  It may not seem like much, but I do what I can.

Oh dear, you don't want me to start talking about God.  Suffice to say, I feel He has done a great deal for me, whether my life has been good or bad, easy or hard.  My faith has never been greater than it is now.

I think the best solution would be constant protesting and recruit recruit recruit. We could have people making speeches and spreading information to everyone. The more people we recruit the harder it would make for them to gain control. What could they do? Use military force? Then it would make our cause even stronger. At some point they would ahve to comment on our motives and they can't blow off such good questions with such large amounts of evidence. We should create anarchy and unite everyone. The war should be targeted ofcourse, almost everyone with 2 and a half brain cells can agree that was a wrong move. I mean come on, they did it on a 'vague' accusation that osam bin laden attacked the twin towers. Did they ever give real proof? I remember the broadcast, "Osama Bin laden has a website up about why america sucks bla blah it must b e him". THen I bet they would try labeling us as terrorists, and that is why we cannot do anything violent. But jesus christ there is just so much evidence out there, if we bring all of that to peoples front door and rub it in there face and they STILL are against our cause, then maybe we don't deserve to to overcome the situation if we are really that ignorant.

We need people to realize that we can't work along with the government, we need to eliminate the problem. Target the source of it and end it. There is too much evidence they couldn't give a rats butt about us. they dont want to help us in any way. They only do so when enough people rally to a certain cause and focus on imrpoving and then they get so much crap that they are forced to begin easing up and we begin to win. But we aren't pushing in the right area. It's all the same people, we all need to focus our efforts on one point and then we will begin to see results. All people need to realise is:
<br>
<br>
* We all have one enemy
<br>
* Together we are unstoppable

It could mean jumping off a cliff to save a child. It could mean dying for a great cause.
<br>
I dont like the dying part of that.
<br>
I am not afraid to die at the hands of the illuminati, i am afraid though that if we act so 'fearlessly' it will come up on the world to fast. It takes time, and we have time (not a lot) but enough. Humanity has already started to jump start into awarness mode. Every day more ppl become aware. We have to wait until its enough that there is sufficent public approval oh a whole.
<br>
otherwise the illuminati will just call us 'crazy whackos' and we will ... not have a bright future in thsi world.

That's why we need more people speaking out and providing the evidence of tyranny being run from behind the scenes. It's like they say: people won't revolt if they believe they're already free. We're already seen as whackos, lol.
<br>
<br>
But don't be mistaken: there
<i>
 is
</i>
scientific evidence based on solid physics that the Twin Towers came down via demolition, the FBI has admitted having no paper trail at all on Bin Laden despite earlier claims, several of the suspected hijackers have been confirmed still alive in various countries, and to go further, the Bush Admin and those pushing for the EU constitution are beginning to sacrifice our basic rights and privileges for more control over us all, and many western leaders are from strictly maintained bloodlines dating back through hundreds of years of rulers. Needless to say, there are a lot of details to fill in, but this stuff isn't based on faith or fantasy. It's just a matter of educating yourself. In our modern world, psychology is being implemented at a level never before seen in our history, and this is why we're having such a problem getting information out there and getting change today. There is no visible, up-front king or ruling party as there were in the times of the American and French revolutions. Now it's all deception and manipulation from being the scenes.

Well it is a bit complicated. yesterday when I was high, I cryed which is quite rare for me. I began to realize the scope of the situation of me, and the world. I asked a question and I was brought the answer by myself. I sort of had a very emotional moment of clarity. I beleive I became more independent because of this experience. After that I calmed down and had some more marijuana and just 'spaced out' to relax myself from the ordeal I had just went through. Marijuana high can one of great brain storming and discovery, or a period of relaxation and fun.

Bah, marijuana doesn't sound very dangerous while depressed then. I suspected it would calm you down some but wasn't sure. Psychadelics like acid and shrooms, by comparison, have sent people into deep fits of morbid depression for hours when taken unresponsibly. Those kinds of drugs seem really reflective and deep in nature, which can go any way in terms of emotional experiences.

<br>
I dunno about the building corners exploding, but one of the planes went in a little off from taking such a tight turn and started coming out of the other side of the building, and there were sparks coming from under the fuselages of both planes before impact. What was interesting about the tower attacked lopsidedly is that the core columns were missed almost
<i>
 completely
</i>
by the plane (upwards of 98% still intact I would say from diagrams), and yet the buildings still came down identically, lol.
<br>
<br>
You have to be careful with the Pentagon hole, too, because people trying to debunk the 'conspiracy theories' like to put down people who say the hole wasn't big enough. The truth of the matter is that the hole
<i>
 is
</i>
big enough for a plane, but
<i>
 not
</i>
a 757. More like a commuter plane, or some large personal jet, etc. From the 45-degree angle of impact, the hole is 13 feet too small horizontally, and some number of feet too small vertically, to be consistent with a 757 impact even when taking into account very questionable parts of the 'hole' (ie, places where the large wings would have allegedly struck, but somehow disappeared after impact). There have been very careful investigations into the photographic evidence from the Pentagon to correctly measure the hole in the facade since it would later collapse, and you can be certain that no 757 jumbo-jet struck it, but neither should you believe that it was all the work of a bomb, etc. Something went into the building nonetheless.

Death is something that happens to all but death is a lie at least to beings of greater intelligence. To us many emotions limit us of the capability's we posses but if you end your life to soon the lessons to be taught to you. In our moments of clarity all makes sense but our minds are so used to questioning everything we start to question things that make sense so eventually your sense is nonsense but still are the exact same thing.

well i have seen so many people get totally screwed from pot.
<br>
And yes in cases i have seen personally it greatly increases depression, not during the high though... during the high you can feel great.. but coming down and in between hits you feel like excrement.
<br>
<br>
People say it's not addictive and you can get off it any time, you just dont want to because "there's nothing wrong with it".... riiiight...
<br>
How about you try going off it for a month? starting today, if you can't do it then you're addicted.
<br>
<br>
You can get addicted to any chemical you take in. You can even get addicted to people due to their scent and saliva (for closer relationships), I've experienced this personally with a g/f of 9 months.
<br>
<br>
Seeing how you dont seem to have many people you can really talk to, i doubt you have anyone that you would listen to that really know the dangers of any drugs including pot.
<br>
<br>
I'm not a total anti-marijuana preacher either. I have taken it myself a few times, it felt good on the high (nothing too great) but coming down made me so paranoid. It's true that it affects different people in different ways.
<br>
I can be slightly (not totally) paranoid most of the time, and it just increased that paranoia for quite some time.
<br>
You're depressed, so it therefore is increasing your deppression and the more you take it, the longer it will keep you depressed.
<br>
<br>
and about getting help... You can go and see a Psychologist, they dont prescribe drugs. Psychiatrists do.
<br>
Psychologist help you in different ways, giving you someone to talk to and work through your problems.
<br>
<br>
If you want true clarity and strength get off marijuana. It's just another weakness that you could do without.
<br>
<br>
And do you have a job? or go to school?

heter, could you please anwser Syke's questions? Maybe you just haven't gotten to them yet.
<br>
<br>
A lot of ppl are disagreeing on this stuff about marijuana. I think i've seen enough to believe its not harmful if your not addicted, and not depressed, but you say you are depressed.
<br>
<br>
Syke- Heter would go see a Psychologist over his dead body... so i think telling him to do that (its not just you, a lot of ppl have) is sort of pointless, although i dont see why he has a problem with it, i would prolly feel the same way if i was in his position.. well idk but i can see how seeing a  Psychologist  does not seem appealing.
<br>
<br>
Guys (and girls), what heter needs are suggestions that DONT deal with doing things with friends. In his case that's not possible. What else can he do?
<br>
<br>
<br>
again, heter i think Syke asked some good questions, i think everyone here wanta know your opinion on them (including the marijuana one).
<br>
Syke gave the best proof possible for it, real life experience. But of course, like Syke said it changes for diff ppl...
<br>
u know how u said 95% of school killer ppl were on anti depressents? most were also on marijuana.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Heter- tell them about your school situation. I dont want to say it incase you feel uncomfortable about it. idk.
</b>
<br>

<section>
As for getting people to all band together--it won't happen.  You can tell people until you're blue in the face that the government is evil, that they've got us in their iron fist, and that this country is going to crash and burn.  But the majority of people won't care.
<br>
<br>
Why?  Because they've got their houses, their SUVs, their designer clothes, their high-definition TVs, more food than they can eat... never mind that they're all in debt up to their eyes--they don't care as long as they're happy, comfortable, and have all the latest status symbols.
<br>
<br>
The people who keep them like that are the big corporations.  And who caters to the big corporations?  The government.  That's why, for example, the government doesn't do anything about all the parasitic illegal immigrants--not only do they do nothing to prevent them coming into this country, they give them special treatment--illegal immigrants can get drivers licences and vote in our elections, among other things.  Because the big corporations don't want to have to pay honest money for employees!  They want to keep enough of their profits so they can pay off the government to keep on supporting them.
<br>
<br>
And while I have great faith in our educational systems--I see great things happening all the time at my school--it's also got its share of corruption by money.  I went to undergrad school at a great private school.  I had to work my butt off to get in there, and my parents and I owe lots of money we borrowed for tuition.  And yet, there were people in some of my classes who literally could not READ.  These were the people who could pay their way.  And they got the same diplomas my honest friends and I got.  Talk about feeling cheapened!
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I belong to a profession that doesn't take excrement from anyone.  For example, we would rather delete all our records than let some Fed come in and paw through them under sanction of the "Patriot Act."  In a library, everyone is truly equal.  Most librarians are not in the profession for love of money---although you can bet that government libraries pay 3-5 times more than any other kind of library.  Not because the work is harder or the librarians are better, but because they have to basically bribe librarians to leave their values at the door.

hmm well if u didnt listen to me, will you listen to her?
<br>
I doubt the world is going to come together in a 'uprising of righteousness' kind of thing. Thats another conditioning trap. In all the movies, someone speaks out, and all of a sudden everyone believes them!!
<br>
Sadly movies are different from real life.
<br>
The populations of the world will never TOTALLY come together, but i think as time progresses more people will awaken, but never all. Hopefully half, but that is a lot to ask for.
<br>
If you speak out right now, have fun, because it will be about your last day on this earth. Heter, if your going to commit suicide, please instead of killing yourself, go to a busy mall and say something about the illuminati, and then do it at home, after. Just make your death worth something, something helpful. Psh but what am i'm saying, your not gonna kill urself.
<br>
<br>
So anyway, Almst Mrs. Murphy is right, and we have proof: common sense.

Those privileges may keep people in line and apathetic for the moment, but a few crude nuclear detonations later, and with some further revoked basic human rights and nation-wide depression, you might start to see a change in peoples' attitudes.
<br>
<br>
It wouldn't even take all of those things to get enough people ticked. And remember, the people fighting for our independence in the American Revolution were a minority. Almost half of Americans didn't care, and didn't fight for either side at all. It only takes so many people to make a big difference.

But do you disagree that we are not at that 'stage' or point yet?
<br>
I think if we tried this uprising now, it would be crunched immediately.
<br>
Like i said, each day comes more and more people seeing this truth for the first time.
<br>
Until enough of those days have passed for us to have enough people, i think it is wise to just lay low as we have been for quite some time.
<br>
Maybe it'll take 6 months, maybe 5 years. I dont know, but i think once the media starts to give any attention to this at all, we will know its time.

No, we aren't ready yet, but it would be stupid to wait for the last minute before trying to inform everyone of what motivates all these political events we're seeing today.

Runlola: looool!! ya, now i remember, when we 1st met here in the forum we were talking about running naked in the rain!
<br>
<br>
this afternoon was more or less like that. besides we acted like teens or children. We got all the day doing stupid things.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, coming back to the topic: Heter, a good doctor can help because if he is really good he will act within your family too. If he is good he wil know how to act.
<br>
<br>
Now, about the tips: OrionsDream said that you need tips not involving friends because you dont have. Ok, i wil come back to that later.
<br>
<br>
Now, about doing things alone, you can do all what i´ve said before. Why you dont do this: when you get a little better (you will get, believe me, i was depressed and due to chmestrys in my brain, some days i would wake up better) you will organize your life. Make a list of things that you need to do.
<br>
<br>
Have a kind of secret diary where you write what you want, what you need, and how to achieve it.
<br>
<br>
You  must have an objective or something funny to do. Some ideas:
<br>
<br>
1- Bonsais Trees: thats really relaxing and great. You need intelgence to create one in the right way.
<br>
<br>
2- If you like cars and electronics, maybe you could try to build a small car, with remote control. Sometimes you can find nice collections for buying.
<br>
<br>
3- buy LEGOS! Really There are some amazing Legos outhere for adults and i am thinking in buying some: Robots. These legos (from what i read) need some learning on programming. It must be really funny you create your on Robot
<br>
<br>
4- About Programming: why not create a smal PC game? i start doing that one day but then i got tired quickly (i got tired quickly from everything)
<br>
<br>
5- Take care of your garden and try to create something new and beautiful on it.
<br>
<br>
These are some random ideas. You got the idea. Anyway, you really need friends. Do you have neighbours? cousins leaving near? If you have neighbours why dont you speak with them?
<br>
<br>
Maybe the girl on next door....if you have a girl on next door speak with us, we can give you some tips (ya: seek Hans Solo or Frank here in AP forums
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, i still dont get the reason of your depression. From what i read, from researches, etc, guys that want to kill themselves at your age have their problem on family. Teenagers are not depressive-suicide-people like you think. All teenagers are very healthy and have normal problems. They only think on suicide with a good reason. Thats not teenager bovine excrement. Some of them (i hoope thats your case) jut speak on suicide (but they will never do it) because they want the attention that they never had.
<br>
<br>
Others have real bad problems.
<br>
<br>
In my teen years i was like you but i had problems with my family. Problems enough to take me into a depressive state and later on, that "cancer" was almost make me to commit "seppuku" (suicide).
<br>
<br>
If you want to expose your problems we will hear them and respect you. If you prefer to speak in PM with us thats ok too. Sometimes, "breathing" in internet its better than having no one in real life for hearing us.
<br>
<br>
And please, stop complaining that you cannot find friends: grab some of the guys that you know from your shcool and go swim naked to the river

<section>
LOL! what is with you and nakedness?? haha i could never imagine doing that with my friends! idk if thats how older ppl act or something! lol jk.
<br>
<br>
But a good question is heter- why can't you find friends? There are so many oppurtunities in the world today to do that. I know you don't go to school, so that takes a lot out of it, but if you find at least one friend, you can join that friend's little 'group' of friends.
<br>
<br>
Having fun with friends isnt an illuminati-conditioned trap. Please get that into your head.
<br>
<br>
I think kaz had an awesome idea with the garden thing. It requires attention and energy, and the more of that u put into it, the more beautiful it will be.

Yes I'm sure there aren't too many super attractive people at nudist beaches... I havn't personally been to one, but each to their own.

And OrionsDream, i know you mean well, but telling us all that heter is "fat and "has no friends" isn't very compassionate.
<br>
If he wanted us to know that he probably would tell us himself. It's just kinda rude, thats all.

But I do see your good intentions.

Heter- I'm sure you know we're not trying to offend you.
<br>
<br>
In what way do you think your situation is being underestimated?
<br>
Is it because ppl are suggesting to go to 'naked beaches' and that sort of thing?
<br>
<br>
I think we are all giving him too much of advice dealing with staying away from his 'problem' or depression or w.e u wanta call it, instead of ideas for fixing it.

I few months ago I had to make a decision between military school and this. I had started getting into spiritual things and I knew the education system was crap anyway so i decided to get a high school diploma through the interenet aas opposed of going back to high school or military school. I was really hating high school for the first few motnhs I had done it and I just wanted to get away from all those false people. I am still happy with my decision and I will be getting my diploma soon.

Confidence comes with experience. Do as i did. Go out and speak to a lot of women. Think on that as something fun, like  a game. The more women you speak the more  you learn. I just love to go out and speak to any girl. They love that too. I just dont know how much they will love that at your age.

 Confidence comes with experience. Do as i did. Go out and speak to a lot of women. Think on that as something fun, like  a game. The more women you speak the more  you learn. I just love to go out and speak to any girl. They love that too. I just dont know how much they will love that at your age.

Kaz has a point. Why NOT go out and speak to women? Whats the worst that could happen? She say you weird or strange and walk off? So what! Its not like you go to school where every1 will laugh at you the next day! You have more freedom to do that then most ppl today!

Heter, is the only reason you did not go to a regular high school was because you thought you wouldn't learn anything true...?

Whats with all this government conspiracy with everything from the same bloodline stuff?
<br>
<br>
Are you guys suggesting Tony Blair, George Bush, John Kerry, Howard Dean, Ken Mehlman, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosefelt, and Ariel Sharon are all somehow related to each other?
<br>

As for depression, running really helps. It creates a natural high. Being skeptical of everything you read can also help. Don't believe every single conspiracy theory you've ever read. Barely any of them are based on fact.

<section>
RTC - Take out Ariel Sharon, Dean and Mehlman (just for good measure, because I'm not too sure on those guys), and you've got it exactly. Bush and Kerry are actually ninth cousins, twice removed. Another study reportedly found that Kerry is related to all of the royal houses of Europe. As for the rest of them, they all come down from the same European bloodline. The line originated out of Germany some few hundred years ago. I'm not sure where it was before then. But yeah; they're not exactly close family, but they're all related.
<br>
<br>
Btw, you can look this stuff up on your own if you'd like. The perception that a lot of conspiracy theories are based on total bs is misleading in itself. There is a lot of crap out there, yes, but generally there is also at least some truth to what you hear. It is possible to sift through the garbage and arrive at a clear picture of the happenings of the world if you can manage to find some good sources.

Yeah, Heter you seem to be really caught up on being scared, or overly angry at the illuminati and our politics.
<br>
<br>
Why you wont go in a park: Because you dont want to listen to all the conditioned children's laughter....
<br>
You need to take a serious look at your mindset. If children have been conditioned, it doesnt mean that their laughter is 'conditioned' as well.
<br>
<br>
If you enjoy life, just a little, to get out of this depressive state, I dont think you will be giving the illuminati a victory.
<br>
If anything, the illuminati would LOVE to see their enemies depressed and lost.

First, we do not have to be manipulated by anyone, we need to use discernment, and have the confidence to hold our own in this world, as well as in non-physical dimensions.  Just because some people are doing wrong doesn't mean that we all are, however unless you are coherent with the way you think you should act, you will not attract like minded people.
<br>
Secondly, we are the number one cause of our surroundings.  If we are unhappy with the world we live in the problem almost always stems from ourselves.  We get what we put out, in other words, what is the level of your thoughts, energy and intentions?  If we constantly feed the negative this is all we will get.  There are problems with the world, but it is here where we can help change these things.  The fact that you recognize the trouble shows that you are already more lucid than many individuals we are living around.  The trick is to remember or at least try to have some intuitions on why you are here.  You must remember who is counting on you? this might seem like nobody but yet there are people waiting in the wings that are counting on you to help.
<br>
Third-  We do not change from one dimension to the next.  Killing yourself will not take away the pain or make you wise.   To be a "Spirit guide" you need to earn this, and the quickest way to better yourself is right here in the physical where we are placed with many people different then us.
<br>
Perhaps your goal should be to work more with these Spirit guides by adapting their qualities to yourself such as assistance, serenity, wisdom, ethics, and more.
<br>
<br>
Wishing you all the best

I am reading the new book of Dan Brown about illuminati and it seems that they were real and dont exist anymore. MAybe they still exist but their power it just the power to influence normal and boring politics. MAybe due to them some wars were created and others avoided, but i dont care. They dont influence my personal life, besides what can i do about them? If i am happy and free to think and live, i should only care with illuminati if they are destroying the world (with politics that will grow up the polution in earth; with wars, etc).

Hi folks-
<br>
<br>
Ahh, the conspiracy theorist.  I run into them all the time.    Most of the conspiracy theorist don't know there As* from a hole in the ground, and yes I know ALL of the theories out there.  From Adam Wisecoff starting the Illuminati to skull and bones, CFR, Triladeral commission, Bildabergers, etc.  I have even read some conspiracy theory books and finally decided SO much of it is BUNK.  Does that mean that individuals in places of power don't help each other, no.  The books read like this: Rothschild was in league with Rockefeller to con troll the money through banks because Rockefeller's gardener knew Adam Chipshield, the head accountant for Disney who worked with Blah blah blah.  IT DOESN'T MATTER!!!
<br>
<br>
IF, and that's a big "if", these conspiracies are true it doesn't help going around and telling people.  Nobody believes these people except 9th grade high school kids and Evangelical hicks.  The funny thing is the Evangelicals Constitutionalists will scream about this, but if you ask them they say that they want it to happen because Jesus is coming back to take them to heaven!
<br>
<br>
Assuming these conspiracies are true, the solution is and always will be small government.  You can cite specific examples of how government is NEVER the answer and that it never accomplishes anything. With out a big government these groups have NO control.  A big corporation can't enslave you or put you in a gulag.  Which brings me to a point.  Most of these "Constitutional" conspiracy theorist are for building a wall along the border and stopping all the Mexicans from getting in.  What they are too stupid to realize is that a border good enough to keep all the Mexicans out is good enough to keep us all in, and they are the ones screaming about a coming police state!
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
When asked what they are going to do about it they say "call talk shows and wake people up", when pressed they say "Nothing I can do about it, it is predicted in the Bible".  What a disempowering belief system!  These people won't even take a stand and say "enough" to the government.  Also, how come you are the only one that is not "brainwashed", and are you so sure you aren't?  Stop listening to Alex Jones and get out of the house and enjoy what freedoms you have, and start supporting those that are trying to increase your freedoms.  This exact discussion happened yesterday on

 www.freetalklive.com
</a>
(look at the archives-Tuesdays show)
<br>
<br>
Also, about the 4D reptilian that David Icke talks about.  You want to commit suicide based on David Ickes testimony and his followers, COME ON!!!!!  Where is the proof, just one picture--besides that stupid picture of Al Gore mad!  Hell, I can look like that when I get mad, I know Alex Jones does. Is he a reptilian?
<br>
<br>
Government is the problem not the Illuminati.  Thomas Jefferson knew this when he said "The natural order of things is for Government to grow and Liberty to yield."
<br>
<br>
The answer is to support small government not research conspiracies.
<br>

Enjoy life,

Wow Hans.. Thank god you know the truth and are able to tell us everyone that believes conspiracy theories are 9th grade students or hicks.
<br>
<br>
I have infact just finished high school and was introduced to this sort of material by a friend.. who has a masters in teaching.. who was given david ickes book by her friend who has been a doctor for the past 15 years.
<br>
<br>
So I guess your theory is that all conspiracy theorist are crazies.. but be careful how you word it, because if someone doesn't believe you then next thing you know you'll fall in to the same pool.
<br>
<br>
You only know as much as anyone else in the main-stream public, so don't get all high and mighty and believe you have the right to blatently insult other peoples beliefs just because you believe something else.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to see you going to a church or any form of place of worship and arguing with the congregation about their belief system.

I take it you're anti-religion too? You'd have to be to make the claims you have, on people making predictions based on the bible, as that is pretty much all religion is. One collection of books or scriptures and such, read as (literal) holy words.
<br>
<br>
Yes I believe a lot of the theories could be true... just as i believe they could be false... just as i believe religion could be true or false.. I don't follow a belief system.. i guess that makes it easier to accept and take an objective but reasonable look on matters.
<br>
<br>
I agree that it is rediculous to consider suicide over any of the theories presented by anybody. Especially the far fetched ones, such as David Icke's Reptilian Agenda.
<br>
<br>
So it'd be best to keep an open mind about EVERYTHING!... If you can supply hard evidence to disprove the theories then do so.. but don't just bad mouth theorists by giving your own theory on them. You just end up contradicting yourself.
<br>
<br>
And heter, get over it. Stop seeking attention from people that can't even see you.
<br>
Get out... or don't. Do whatever you want... that's pretty much the thing here, everyone is telling you to want to do some... "if you wanted to go for a walk and you did you'd be happy..... SO GO WALKING!".. doesn't quite work.
<br>
Maybe walking doesn't make you happy, maybe all it does is make you sore, tired and sweaty.
<br>
We havn't got the answers and even if we did you wouldn't accept them because you're content in whinging and complaining and getting a reaction.
<br>
So continue if that's what's gonna stop you from killing yourself, even though it's likely you wouldn't anyway.

Enjoy Stuff

The early Christians thought the end times were going to happen 100 years after Christ death, then every 100 years after that, then at the start of the new centuries, and now 2012.  Did you know that there were originally 2 end times in the bible but the church only kept the Apocalypse and removed the Apocrypha (good stuff happening).  Research this for yourself at

Religion is used mainly as control of the masses.  Did you know that in the Dark Ages they kept the bible in the Greek form so the citizens could not read it, and had to rely on the Priest.  When Gutenberg invented the printing press and printed off enough bibles for the common man to have one he almost got arrested.  But then again, that is probably the devil making me type this stuff

All conspiracies do is make SOME people point to a Wizard of OZ, some all knowing force, that can pull off the  most amazingly intercate schemes without a hitch.

In all, I think we both agree most conspiracies are bunk

Han, I set up a thread a while back on 9/11 that didn't get a whole lot of feedback thaht maybe you can contribute to. I posted it a while ago and have picked up quite a few things since then, if you should want to give the thread a bump.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
What we can assume, if that's true, is that all of the following events were planned ahead of time. War in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the general so-called "war on terror," as well as the passing of legislation such as the Patriot Act and other movements limiting freedoms in the name of security were all designed to be put forth after 9/11 here in the US. They simply wouldn't have worked otherwise, without huge civil protest (moreso than now even). That alone is pretty suggestive of some behind-the-scenes agendas. And again, if you should want to re-open that thread as to whether or not 9/11 was an inside job, it's right there.
<br>
<br>
What I would have to wonder is if this was an isolated event in human history, or a part of a larger pattern. Corruption itself is certainly nothing new to history, and neither is it anything new that the people in power will do things to deceive or manipulate the people en masse.
<br>
<br>
The burning of Rome and the Reichstag Fire were both designed to manipulate large masses of people (Romans and Germans, respectively). No one suspected it when it happened. Their leaders would never do such a thing! They were too wholesome; too concerned for the common man! Especially with the Reichstag. Those Nazi leaders could never burn their own parliament building and blame communists in order to invade other countries! That's absurd! Let's not forget that corruption and scandals are certainly nothing new to this age of American History even, from Teapot Dome to Watergate to the Iran-Contra Affar to Waco. It's been increasingly worse this whole past century. And all of this is only the corruption that has been exposed.
<br>
<br>
We take too much of this stuff for granted today, and that's the bottom line of it. Yes, there is a lot of bs out there, but unfortunately also a lot of it is not. It's easy for someone to come out and lay it on people who don't have any facts straight and ready for them. At the same time, anybody with half a brain could research the 2000 election controversy, the 2004 elections and the Diebold corporation, the reasoning and manipulation surrounding the invasion of Iraq, the Downing Street Memo, and even back to the events of 9/11 itself and figure out that there's something amidst here that is not all sweet and simple, black and white, and good vs evil. The people that are the real trouble today are the ones that forget history, submit to the simplistic psychology, and refuse to consider for a second that even some of this may be true. These same people do not deserve to live in a democracy. Quite frankly they ruin it for us all.
<br>
<br>
Again, the thread's still there. It's been a while since anyone's posted on it, and there's a lot more that I've picked up that would be wonderful to share.

I agree with most of what you wrote.  Powerful people conspire all the time to acquire and maintain power, and more often than not they use the force of government for this reason.  I have to say that I NEVER believe the government's story of what happened on 9/11, but then again I don't believe Micheal Moore's or Alex Jones's either.

<br>
Notice how major scandals on tragic events happen with more frequency as the government gets larger.  Big government is a magnet for those that want to increase personal power and control, and thus is nothing new in human history.  Also, some famous person once wrote "War is the health of the State", and there is nothing more accurate.  I think it was a paper called "The project for a New American Century" that best describes the Bush Plan for war.
<br>
<br>
I agree that people conspire and you'll find most of the control freaks in government, however I just don't buy the whole Cabal of people with the same idealized goal or plot.  I especially don't buy the whole reptilian aliens controlling everything.
<br>
<br>
The thing I am trying to get across is that no matter if there is or isn't a conspiracy the solution is still the same.  The solution is small government like our founding fathers in visioned (who by the way were EVIL Masons as some conspiracy people would say)  Without the reigns of government no control freak can commit mass genocide, police state, etc.

and I think the Action-Reaction-Solution theory is pretty spot on... soon we'll see a major event with thousands of people missing or unidentifiable... and bingo! Human Micro-chipping. Because remember, we need it.

<br>
So the governments will cause this big disaster (blaming it on someone else of course).. The public will be in a state of shock and sadness, looking for a solution... the government offers them one that fits what they desire. Mass control.
<br>
As far as conspiracy theories go you just have to take what you want from them, and ignore what you dont.
<br>
<br>
You must also be careful on how much credit you give the more popular theorists. They could in fact be working for the people they're damning.
<br>
They often use the excuse "if they shut me up they just back up what ive been saying" when someone asks why they can still say all this stuff without "them" stopping them.
<br>
If they really are that powerful and the theorists are so correct then there would be no difficulty in getting rid of them and making it look like nothing... or making them just disappear.
<br>
<br>
Anyways I'm done now. Catch.

Yep. Remember how frequent outright war was before the invention of the atomic bomb? Especially in Europe, there were almost
<i>
 always
</i>
massive wars being waged. The people in charge didn't care as to whether or not people were dying. They just wanted power.
<br>
<br>
War today is still a huge moneymaker, no question. But what are we fighting now? We can't wage war with any big countries with nukes anymore, so it should come as no surprise as to what we
<i>
 have
</i>
been fighting: Korea, Vietnam, the so-called "Cold War," and two Iraq wars, a war in Afghanistan and definitely more to come from the new "War on Terror."
<br>
<br>
Small government will not last anymore without an educated population, that will react when their civil liberties are infringed upon or when corrupt wars are started, and not just sit back dumb and happy until things that actually start directly effecting them go down.
<br>
<br>
Have you thought about how the Constitution can be changed for next time around, Hans? Personally I was thinking banning corporate/government ties of any sort should be a high priority, also ensuring the media sticks with actual
<i>
 journalism
</i>
, and loosening the government's chokehold on scholarship via that damned federal funding. Why do you think there has been little to no publicity on long-term alternative energy, despite the work of Tesla and others being in public domain for about a hundred years? Discouragement of the scholarship to persue that field via threats of cutting off funding. And thus we stick with oil, constantly told that it will soon run out and we have to pay more $$ for it. We could probably stand to have an odd number of presidents, too, and should do something in the way of modern political parties.

Mmmm. The only reason I wouldn't commit suicide is because there are people on this planet that love me... Dying and getting stuck on earth would be a good thing in my oppinion

- and you don't need to eat or sleep...

Also: Why is suicide against the law in some countries? I mean, if you commit suicide, what can the police do?

I've wondered that too. I think they can get you on an attempt, and then make you go to some clinic or something for help.

I think many people 'think about suicide' but very few actually TRY and do it. Big difference there.
<br>
Why was this question asked in the first place?

<section>
there is a differenc between trying and doing it. Psychologists say that some people that try think that they wanna they but in fact they dont want it, they are just calling for help. They try the act and fail it for others to see it and then help them. The worst cases are the people that are really really so bad that they commit suicide and period. No turn back.
