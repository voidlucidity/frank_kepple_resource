Hello, All
<br>
<br>
According to most commentary I have read concerning the chakra I am dysfunctional from my root to my throat. Only the one referred to as the third eye seems close to normalcy, typically have a majority of balanced traits with a couple of malfunctional traits. The crown, to my understanding, is normally not to activate in most people.
<br>
<br>
I am willing to try out anything to alleviate my lack of will. To bring more energy and zeal to my earthly existence. I have read it is best to start from the roots and work ones way up to the canopy. How would I go about bringing my root chakra's energy up to par with an average person?

I think that energywork as described in Robert Bruce's NEW and Treatise About  Astral Projection would be good for a start.
