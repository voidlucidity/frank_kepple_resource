I was dreaming last night which turned into a lucid dream which I was left unaware that I was dreaming. (my most common problem and complaint, my mind tends to suspend disbelief for me leaving me locked in the mindset that my dream is not a dream... hard to explain) I was thinking about phasing and I started doing a rundown and the mental images where really vivid.  I thought "oh this is a great time to try and phase!"  So I successfully phased inside of F2.  I phased into a video game straight from my old school collection, lethal enforcers!  Except this version starred Mark Hammell as the lead cop character for some bizzarre F2 reason.  I woke up and was blown away by the fact that I phased in F2 when I basically already was phased.  All in all a totally strange and fun experience.  Anyone else ever do this?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should point out again that while dreaming and stepping into your imagination during a mental rundown, or other more traditional "astral projection" experiences, typically all take place within the area of consciousness I label Focus 2, in my Phasing Model of Consciousness... they are NOT the same
<i>
 action
</i>
in consciousness.
<br>
<br>
There are what might be called sub-divisions of Focus 2 that each individual will incorporate for their purposes. Mystics in the past have called them "levels" but there are no levels in consciousness. They are merely regions in consciousness that we create for the convenience of our individual experiences.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I understand that my experience was inside of F2 the whole time.  Are you saying that phasing and traditional obe exits take me to different subdivisions of F2?

<br>
is this in reference to phasing vs. traditional exits or maybe even dreams?
<br>
<br>
Sorry for being so confused.  I just wanted to share my experience and attempt to get over the rage that filled me when I woke up and realized that I hadnt actually phased from F1 like I had thought I had.

<section>
he is just saying that while dreaming and phasing both take place in your F2, they are different actions. In the same way that riding a bike and riding a motorcycle both take place on 2 wheels. Just different "levels" as Frank said.
<br>
<br>
I think its crazy that you mention this. Just this morning I had a huge breakthrough. I was inside a dream (i think, my memory is foggy) and i started to phase. I gained lucidity, but here is where things are messed up. I was lucid, but unable to manipulate my environment. This leads me to believe that I was actually
<i>
 dreaming that I was phasing
</i>
, and not actually phasing. This is what I believe Frank meant.
<br>
<br>
While dreaming and phasing both take place in your "imagination", they are 2 different actions, and while I can REMEMBER my dream of phasing, I wasnt actually consciously phasing. Hope that it up for you.
<br>
<br>
PS this experiance, while it might not have been full blown phasing, was still a blast as I dont remember my dreams that often. I heard taking lecithen daily can help, so i think i will try that.
<br>
<br>
PSS In my dream, right before I phased i experianced a slight vibration, it was in my back i think. Then the "dream scenery" would sort of fade in and there I would be. Is this anything like the real phasing experiance or is my mind messing with me?
