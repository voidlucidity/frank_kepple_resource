Having tried the traditional methods for 4 years, I am now switching to phasing. I've read many of Frank's posts on this forum but have questions.
<br>
<br>
Should the noticing happen once I'm in the hypnogogic stage? Or, should I be noticing the mind ramblings that happen on the way and just let them go, waiting to enter the hypnogogic stage? And once I'm sensing dream snippets should I enter them more seriously and try to go with them or just notice them? At what point do you exactly begin to manufacture a scenario using your imagination?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
This is a good question.
<br>
<br>
The Noticing exercise is for complete beginners. It gets people used to simply looking within themselves. If you got the first issue of my newsletter then you will have read about how I made this particular point that everything you want to do, Phasing or otherwise, is all WITHIN you. Some people have been so used to in some way "exteriorising" their awareness trying to "obe" in a conventional sense they simply cannot get to grips with the creating of a mental rundown thing. They need a little practice first just learning how to look within themselves. So that's when I recommend the Noticing exercise.
<br>
<br>
At first, people close their eyes and all they see is blackness. Unfortunately, this can put people off thinking they are never going to do it. When I close my eyes all I see is blackness at first. But if people learn to actually notice what is taking place they may see that one area of black is not quite so black as the rest. Then they may kind of sense something. Then there might be a little fleeting something or other that just passed by. Perhaps a swirl of colour, maybe you just heard a sound, or think you heard a sound but it's confusing because you didn't hear it with your ears. Perhaps you just heard your name. Then maybe there was a flash, or was there? Now there's that sound again. And there's this swirling purple colour with a hint of yellow and red in the middle. Now someone's singing something... at which point people tend to get overwhelmed thinking, "Hey, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!" Then they get zapped right out of the state, all excited realising that it's working for them.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, people get to the stage where they see what is commonly called "hypnogogic imagery" (this is the Monroe Focus 12 state).
<br>
<br>
Many people ask me, "What do I see?" Well, at first all I see is blackness. But as my eyes and face start to relax I see a light in my mind. It is in an upwards direction, almost straight up but cranked back a bit. It's not a pinpoint light like a torch, it is more like an area of light, like a light-grey/white cloudy area. I focus my attention on this cloudy area and after about 10 or 15 minutes it's like the cloud descends on me and I'm surrounded by this grey/white cloud. At this point I'm almost at the stage where I have made the switch. Once I make the switch, the whiteness generally changes to swirling clouds of colour. Then there is a feeling of forwards movement for a second or two, at which point I emerge into the 3D-Blackness at the Monroe Focus 21 state (or Fz of the Phasing Model). I rarely have to do any kind of mental rundown from the physical, as I have now found that "point" in my mind where my "connection" is. So now all I need to do is look to that. If I want to transition to Focus 2 then I will think of going through a mental rundown at Fz and I'll immediately transition to Focus 2.
<br>
<br>
I do not recommend anyone attempt making this direct transition, unless they find they happen to have a knack for it. I'm not sure how much of a general yardstick my experience is. But I only started to find this "connection" after going through the creating of a mental rundown stage for at least a couple of years. It's difficult to say exactly because now I look back and realise that I was sort of half-and-half for ages before I realised about this "connection". What I'm saying is it didn't just suddenly come about one day and I thought, ah, I will do it this way from now on. It was a gradual realisation thing.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, once a person has gotten to the stage where they are used to looking within themselves, it's time to make the switch to Focus 2. So then you create a mental rundown of your choosing, engage your senses and step into it. Doing this puts you slap bang in the middle of Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
