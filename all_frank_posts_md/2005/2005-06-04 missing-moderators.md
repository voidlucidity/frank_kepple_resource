Hi Kaz
<br>
<br>
Moderators come and go.  Both Tisha and Peaceful Warrior resigned due to other commitments.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Dan (Peaceful Warrior) resigned about 6 months ago after finishing university and getting a new job, new responsibilities and all that. Tisha resigned about a month ago after a long absence. She is extremely busy with her retraining for a new career. James S resigned a few months ago as he is busy now with his career. Robert Bruce resigned as he now has his new website and his new forum should be up and running soon. Like Sarah says, times change, people change, events move on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I do still like to pop by when time permits. There's still a lot to be gained from this place.

<img alt=";-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
hope you still come back to forum from times to times. We need good "coachs" and wise people here.
<br>
<br>
You know what, it seems that in these days AP forums its more quiet with less people participating.
<br>
<br>

<section>
When I came back after having been gone for over a year (earlier this year) one of the first thing that I noticed was there were several times as many moderators as there had been before. I thought about it and decided that it was probably much better just being a regular member and not a moderator. My guess was that a lot of people keep wanting things around here, and the private messages I don't see must outnumber actual public posts.

I am very much here I assure you
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Nothing escapes my attention
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I am extremely busy with the book, but I do get alot of members sending me email and private messages instead of posting in the forums on more private matters, and all of those emails would add up to alot of postings here I can tell you. I always help everyone to the extent possible.
<br>
<br>
I am also busy operating the forums from a technical and operational point of view.
<br>
<br>
So I might not be too visible but I am here for everyone and ensuring that everything runs smoothly
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
The moderators do an excellent job for everyone, but it is a large commitment and some of course from time to time find that other demands on their time occur which is understandable.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<br>
It certainly isn't easy at times I can tell you
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
It would however be even more difficult without the excellent work of the team of moderators, and I would like to thank everyone for cooperating with them.
<br>
<br>
Yes, the site does cost money to run because of the considerable resources it uses with tens of thousands of visits per month and thousands of posts.
<br>
<br>
I am improving the resources all the time and will continue to do so for the benefit of everyone.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
