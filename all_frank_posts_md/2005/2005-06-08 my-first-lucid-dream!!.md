I had so much fun the other night! I had my first lucid dream...
<br>
<br>
I was definitely aware that I was dreaming, I kept telling myself and others around me I was to make sure. I wasn't in complete control, because some things still changed without me deciding/noticing, but man, the power!! hehe.
<br>
<br>
I would decide I wanted things and then I would run into the next room and find it there. Knowing you are dreaming allows for manipulation of every character in your dream as well, which helps a lot to keep it going.
<br>
<br>
That was about 2 nights ago and I haven't had one since. I'm hoping I will soon. I think the biggest help was writing down a few words about my dreams when I woke up.
<br>
<br>
I'm SO happy!!!
<br>
<br>
Anyone who's new and looking into this, feel free to ask any questions! I hope everyone will be able to do this soon enough.
<br>

Bye,
