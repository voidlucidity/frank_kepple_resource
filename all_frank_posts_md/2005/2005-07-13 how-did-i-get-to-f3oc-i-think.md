<section>
This is the first time that I have posted a question (yes I have read the faq) so I hope someone can help.
<br>
<br>
First let me say that I have been trying to project for quite some time with limited success. The other day being quiet I thought I would try the phasing method, so I lay down closed my eyes and began relaxing and looking into the 2d darkness. Next thing I knew I had lost feeling of my physical body. The darkness had now taken on a kaleidoscopic effect with the colors all being black. My only thoughts at this time were 'that's odd, not seen that before, wheres the color' and then just as suddenly I was back fully aware and lying on my bed.
<br>
<br>
What I want to know is did I experience F3oc and is it ok or normal to skip F2oc altogether. Also how did I get there? When relaxing and looking into the 2d dark I tend to see yellowish grey blobs floating past and a lot faces flashing in and out of existence so I try to focus beyond the blackness. Mostly I fall asleep and I have only had maybe half a dozen OoBE over the past several years so this could be real progress.
<br>
<br>
Any input would be gratefully received as I hope to be sharing any future success with you all.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It is okay to skip any number of inbetween states and directly transition to whatever area you like. It is not what you might call normal as, at first, people tend to make staged transitions rather than direct transitions. But as a person becomes more experienced the prospect of making direct transitions becomes more likely.
<br>
<br>
With beginners I tend to prefer talking in terms of the Monroe individual attention states. Simply because they are quite easy to understand and, with a little practice, they become immediately recognisable.
<br>
<br>
From what you say you were in the midst of achieving the Monroe focus 3 state, which I would say is a definite sign of progress. Your post also provides a great demonstration of a point I have been trying to get across for a while now about how pointing your focus of attention within you, tends to have the effect of "switching off" the feeling of the physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
