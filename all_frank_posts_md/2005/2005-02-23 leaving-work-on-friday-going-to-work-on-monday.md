I had to share this with you all - I've been on my knees crying all day.
<br>
<br>
Oh bummer - does anyone know how to get .wmv files on here?

<br>
<br>
I tell you, it's worth it.  However, I must admit that I'm not very technical.  I have it as an e-mail, if that's any good?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's a non-starter.

Veccolo - you have a tendency to make me laugh out loud!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
But seriously, I do have something incredibly funny to share, but I don't know how to do it!!
<br>
<br>
Oh well, I'll just sit here sniggering to myself...

I see what you want now. I thought you just wanted a conversion of a screenshot or something, but no, you want people to play the whole file. In which case you need some webspace that you can upload the files to, and then provide a couple of download links on your page here.
<br>

Going to work Monday is sublime.

Sheesh kebab - that's way over my head.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, if anyone wants it - let me know and I'll e-mail it to them.
<br>
<br>
Personally, leaving work on Friday cracks me up just thinking about it, never mind seeing it...
<br>
<br>
hee hee

PS  Frank - have you got sound?  I watched it without sound all day, and then heard it with sound later on, it's about 30 times better...

I'm sorry to everyone else who is totally bored of this thread now, for its non-interest.
<br>
<br>
But Frank - what is that penguin on?  I think he/she's already taken his/her happy pill for the weekend, but I mean really - what the hell is he/she doing?
<br>
<br>
Do you think he/she has simply found his/her soul mate?

<br>
I'm all over the floor with this one - it's funnier than the Oazaki thread.

Sarah:
<br>
<br>
There is a definite element of excitement, but what would be going through the penguin's mind to cause such an outburst is difficult to imagine. Maybe someone stood on his or her toe. Perhaps penguin toes are especially sensitive. :)

Yours,
