Hey all, im David but my friends call me Davo. I have always been an open minded person to the supernatural and so forth, but when my best friend and I started getting interested in the Astral, it opened a spiritual apart of my mind and I began to really research on the subject of Astral Projecting. I haven't projected successfully yet.....well not consciously, but am always trying and researching new ways and new techniques on how to better my result.
<br>
<br>
Well thanks all for reading this, look forward to being of help to everyone and to discover things from others also.
