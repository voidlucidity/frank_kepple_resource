<section>
Hello all, I did read about the spiritual importance of the number seven.
<br>
I just got a new job working for the human services department issuing ebt cards, and i have noticed something very strange.
<br>
<br>
I think it is beyond chance that it can occur as frequently as it does with so many windows open serving clients next to mine.
<br>
<br>
Whenever clients come in for a replacement, I issue their 8th card, the number 7 is on the admin panel for how many cards they have had, i think i should start recording how many times this happens to me, it happens at least 10 times a day, and i only handle 50 clients a day average.
<br>
<br>
I also notice the same deal with the the 14th previous cards issued for clients.
<br>
<br>
Theirs 8 total windows, and its beyond probability that the number seven keeps popping up every hour so frequently.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if it has anything to do with my past experiences with OBE's or my subtle psychic abilities like getting high paying jobs even though I am just 19 yrs old.
<br>
<br>
peace

<section>
Wow, that takes me back.
<br>
<br>
I too had a fixation with the number 7 once. It kept coming up in my dreams, and wherever I looked there was the number 7 in my life.
<br>
<br>
You know, like someone would knock on my door and I'd count the knocks and there would be 7 of them. I'd look at the clock and it would be 7 minutes past 7. Like, that kind of thing. I'd go to the supermarket and the total I'd have to pay would be £77.77. I'd just be completely in awe. Every 7th day I would wake up after 7 hours sleep, exactly, and just have to get up.
<br>
<br>
So one day, on the 7th month, on the 7th day of that month, I thought I'd have a bet. So I layed every penny I had on the 7th horse in the 7th race of that day...
<br>
<br>
And it came 7th. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

On that note, malim, if you want to go to a place where you are sure to have hair-raising experiences with the number seven, you should see a craps table.
<br>
<br>
7 switches from good to bad and back again like an angel choosing sides of a pin.

oh my god, the 7th letter of this sentence is d, which is the 4th letter of the alphabet, and 4 score and 7 years ago from some arbitrary event...
<br>
<br>
I challenge you all to interpret these results in base-9 numbers, where 101 (base 9) = 82 (base 10), and still find meaning. If no meaning is found, justify why base 10 has any significance.
<br>
<br>
I like hex (base 16). It has nice recursive properties. 2^2^2 = 16. But the best recursive properties are in a base much too big for us to memorize. I also prefer base-8  or base-27 (3^3) (but is too much for most  Humans) over base-10. It is apparent that 10 was chosen by idiots because its the number of fingers we have.

Base-9 ... 911?
<br>
<br>
911 = 1222 in base-9
<br>
<br>
1+2+2+2 =
<b>
 7
</b>
(both in base-9
<i>
 and
</i>
base-10).
<br>
<br>
If you say "base-9, 11," separating the 11 from the 9, you get 9 being a base (the PENTAGON), and the 11 as solitary TWIN TOWERS.
<br>
<br>
11 = 12 in base-9, so we just need one more to make 13. Enter the ANTICHRIST.
<br>
<br>
666 = 820 in base-9
<br>
<br>
8+2+0 = 11 in base-9 (9 and 11)
<br>
<br>
As for musings on 7, well, 7 is still 7 in base-9. Although, as I edit this, it is 10:13 so base-10 13 = 16 in base-7.
<br>
<br>
6+1 =
<b>
 7
</b>
, in base-9 and base-10, and
<b>
 10
</b>
in base-7, so the number 7 is telling us we will find safety and protection if we stay in base-10. ;)

Beavis, I did make interpretations and conclusions on the numbers in order to find meaning. But they were rudimentary. I know, just thought I'd give it a shot.
<br>
<br>
It's 8:48 right now and I am contemplating the existence of
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafinitism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 <b>
  ultrafinitism
 </b>
</a>
. With the essential square number 2^2 wedged between it's immediate progeny 2^3, which are infinity symbols on their sides, I can take that as a sign that it does exist. I probably just committed multiple cognitive biases, but, oh well. I kind of like the idea of no infinite set of real numbers. I guess, as Frank said, that's just the way I created my reality.
<br>
<br>
Ironically, ultrafinitism is also known as ultraintuitionism (ironic, for those who are intuitionally minded trying to maximize their "infinite potential"). Now my head really hurts.

Psan if you include toes or not, its still obvious base-10 numbers are so because of body parts and not because its the best number system for mental-only math.
<br>
<br>
Telos it looks like you were making fun of deriving meaning from the numbers in that way. Nobody in their right mind would agree that "we will find safety and protection if we stay in base-10" based on your derivation. Dont make me break out the statistics.

<br>
They claim an infinite set cant exist. Exist is in practice. The idea of infinity is in theory. If an infinite number of anything real exists or not, 0 &lt; 1/infinity &lt; any positive finite number, is still true.
<br>
<br>
0 is an integer. For any integer I there is an integer I+1 and I-1. Recursively apply that rule. No finite number exists where there does not exist a bigger integer G, and if you apply my rule G times, you will derive that G is an integer. But if there were only a finite number of integers, there would have to be some finite minimum and finite maximum integer. Illogical, because it contradicts "I+1 and I-1". There are an infinite number of integers.
