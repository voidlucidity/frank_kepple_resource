Hey all,
<br>
<br>
I was looking for a place to ask and learn about energy, and I cruised around on Unexplained Mysteries until someone posted a link to this cool site.

<br>
<br>
My name is Veronica, and I discovered I was an empath about two months ago, (though I'm not strong at all nor experienced). I've been using it on my dad by giving him arm rubs (he strained his arm lifting a 360 pound weight), to figure out where his pain is. Then awhile later I discovered psi energy, which strengthened my "treatments" twofold, and it's helping him heal quite fast. I need to learn to get better at it though, and I'm a complete newbie at this, I only know some basics.
<br>
<br>
This forum is very intriguing and I hope to learn enough to solve some problems without annoying anyone too much.

<br>
<br>
And perhaps I will also figure out why I could do none of these things a year ago. And what "NEW" and "neg" are.

Hi!
<br>
"NEW" is a meditation designed to develop energy body, it's described on this site:
<br>

<br>
"neg" is a metaphysical entity that feeds on fear and negative emotions. Such entities can do exterme damage if you let them.

<br>
Yes! Absolutely yes! There are an infinite number of ways! And I usually don't use the word "infinite" very often...
<br>
<br>
Think of it as like being a detective... you have to look for good things, seek them out, uncover them, and know that people are hiding them. As you go on, you discover a huge elaborate web of goodness. Have the feeling in your gut that it's there, for you would accept nothing else.
