Pretty much just as the subject heading says, how do you actually move into FZ, ie. the mental action required, cause I'm forever on the edge unable to move into it.

Hmm, we've had this surrender definition debate before and it is right, in a sense. I think people's idea of the concept of surrender, though, gets in the way. People take it like you are involved in some kind of fight that you have lost, so you have to surrender. Almost like it's a kind of negative thing. Waving a white flag shouting "Don't Shoot!" and all that. I'm not suggesting that is what you are saying necessarily. It's just that is the impression the word can engender.

I use the term surrender but don`t think of it in the "white flag" context.I try to reach a state of passive receptivity-open to whatever is going to occur. Perhaps acceptance would be a better term.
