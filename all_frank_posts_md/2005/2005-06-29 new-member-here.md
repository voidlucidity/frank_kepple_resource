Hi everyone,
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
This is my first time posting here.  BTW, ap does not stand for astral projection.

I really am happy to be here and to have found the phasing techniques posted by Frank.  I am getting the newsletter, practicing and am regaining some abilities I let slide over the years as well as learning where some of the experiences I have had are coming from.  From what I have been able to understand so far, I think these would be considered F2 experiences overlaying into F1.  I say that because they have all happened during the day while I am physically awake and busy with my day.  I find them to be totally bizarre and extremely interesting!  My goal now is to work with the phasing practices and learn how to focus at will.  Probing around my mind has brought some rather interesting results but there is so much more that I need to learn.  Looking forward to it.  I should add that I have never taken drugs, or used brainwave tapes.   I really would like to be able to do this on my own if at all possible.  If not, I may be open to listening to some brainwave discs.
<br>
See you on the forums!

Welcome!  I'm fairly new here too, and like you, I'm really interested in phasing.  I am learning so much!  Always something good to read!

Good luck with your phasing!  Have fun!

My name is Dave. This is my first post, and I'm so happy I have found this website. It will be valuable to my interests. I have astral traveled for a while, but recently I have noticed that when I return it feels as if my spirit is slamming back into my body and at that moment I also experience load chaotic noise; as if there is a room filled with people yelling. Has anyone else experienced this and if so what is it ?
