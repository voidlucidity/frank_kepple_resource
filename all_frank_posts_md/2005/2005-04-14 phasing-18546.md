<section>
I've been reading a lot about phasing, such as the "What is Phasing and how can I do it?" post in the Astral FAQ.  I feel that this method (if you can call it a method) resonates with my perceptions of the our existence so I've decided that this is the direction I want to take in my attempts at learning to OBE.
<br>
<br>
So my question is this: Does anyone have any tidbits of advice or anything that might help someone who is just learning phasing and has not yet had a conscious OBE?  Is there something you learned along the way that would have been really helpful had you known it when you were just starting?  I am really excited to learn this and of course want to avoid as many roadblocks as possible.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Danny

I just realized there is a post like two down from this one titled "phasing- ap question" that is very helpful and probably gives me enough to go on so I apologize for wasting a post.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I mentioned in another thread recently, in case you missed it, I have a book in the pipeline but I'll soon be starting a free monthly newsletter which will concentrate solely on my Phasing model and on the Monroe model (to a certain extent the two are related). I'll be making an announcement in selected forums once the technicalities are in place.
<br>
<br>
The newsletter will contain a digest of the replies I have made to various posts that month, plus any other comments and snippets of info.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I'm very interested in both your coming book and your newsletter.  I'll watch for them to come about.  Thanks for the info.
