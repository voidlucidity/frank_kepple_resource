Activating the sex chakra probably happened to many while doing energy work... it just happens like activating any other chakra so why not explore it further?
<br>
I'm new to energy work and have been trying to produce the vibrational state to achieve an obe with only minor successes. Until I discoverd that massaging with awareness hands the sex chakra and trying to reach orgasm actualy produce quite good vibrational states. I wonder if reaching orgasm I would project with minor effort.
<br>
Anyway, why would the orgasm method be a good alternative to achieve obe? Because many people dont know whats the vibrational state and what to do to achieve it, but they surely

know how to try to reach an orgasm with awareness hands. Plus, while doing it (like doing normal sex) you have a strong motivation to continue doing it harder and harder even if you are getting tired. This method is better achieved with abstinence from sex until one develops an urge for it.
<br>
The sexual energy is really powerful... we shouldn't waste it.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone here share similar experiences? I wonder if anyone has actulay achieved OBE using this method.

What is it that you're referring to as the "sex" chakra? Pardon my ignorance, but I'm familiar with a different set of nomenclature. My frame of reference for the major chakras along the spine is as follows:
<br>
<br>
Lowest chakra=Root or Base
<br>
Next up=Spleen
<br>
Next up=Solar Plexus
<br>
Next up=Heart
<br>
Next up=Throat
<br>
Next up=Brow or Third Eye
<br>
Next up=Crown
<br>
<br>
I've read some literature which suggests that an activated spleen chakra is the precursor to consious OBE's. This is from Theosophy.
<br>
<br>
I haven't tried your method, and it may work great. But it seems as though erotic activities may be too exciting and counter to the need for complete relaxation (mind awake, body asleep) which most people see as necessary for successful, consistent OBE's. Let us know how it works....

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you are calling the sex chakra. I avoid the word chakra altogether as it is loaded with belief constructs. But I feel you are activating the yellow energy centre. This area can activate exciting places within your physical body and the obvious does spring to mind.
<br>
<br>
There are a whole load more "sexual" zones you can discover if you are willing to explore. Sexual energy is very powerful when placed within the right context. It can be enjoyed in a singular sense, but its effects are magnified *considerably* within the context of a couple. Of course, other aspects then come into play. Aspects of Trust are extremely important. But when two people commit themselves to each other in a long term sense, who knows what sparks may fly. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
