<section>
Firstly,
<br>
<br>
A warm heartfelt hello to all of you.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Been quite a while since I traveled the psychic road, S'kinda tough to shake off all these stupid world beliefs I've been carrying around for the last ten years or so, hopefully with a bit of help from you guys it'll make the transition alot easier. Practice makes perfect, right?
<br>
I did a psychic development course years ago, trained (If you want to call it that) with a lovely lady, just south of London, here in the UK. It was alot of fun, am kicking myself alot these days for not really continuing with it all, tho as with these things you never really close the door to that stuff once its been opened.
<br>
The funny thing with me finding this place was I was having a conversation with some other guys about OOBs, said to myself that I was fed up with all of this mystical messing around (Have done alot of that in the last 6months)and wanted to cut straight to the heart of the matter, ended up (somehow) looking at the posts Frank had made about his phasing model. Wow!
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
I'd heard very similar things about the wider nature of reality from the lady I did my training with, tho I was given the 7 levels of 7 instruction at the time.
<br>
As for personal experience I guess most of what I've accomplished so far relates to F2 levels, on the odd occasion managed to get OOB. I also made a hemi-sync about 10-15 years ago, did quite a bit of experimenting with that too, weird sensation when you can feel your brain switch off!

<br>
<br>
The only other major experience I can think of at the moment was I remember waking up during a dream, found myself in a conversation with a being that was a flame shape, the colours were amazing! For some reason I felt a pressure on the top of my head, felt like that part of my consciousness was being put back to sleep. But the episode remains vivid to this day
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
Tried working with Franks Phasing model last w/e, after wrestling with that stupid running commentary that the F1 consciousness gives managed to get both the swirly star field effect and the swirly colours. They were these beautiful pastel golds and reds, mixed in with them were a kind of wave shapes you'd see from looking down on sea waves, were a sort of silver colour. I can only guess that somethings happening, tho not sure quite what yet. I'm trying very hard to maintain simple awareness, not letting the commentary loose, also during the working day as well. Still getting mixed result, but I guess it's still rather early yet, after 20 odd years of neglected practice!

<br>
<br>
That's' pretty much all I can think of for the moment, so really look forward to getting some advice about how to progress. F4 just sounds awesome!
<br>
<br>
Take care all, thanks
