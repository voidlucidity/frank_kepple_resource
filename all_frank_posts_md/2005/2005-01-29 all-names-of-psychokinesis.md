Too all of you using such names as Hydrokinesis, Pyrokinesis, Cryokinesis, Aerokinesis, Electrokinesis, etc., I'd like to explain the matter. For all of these so calles "skills", They arent seperate skills. You would normally say you were doing psychokinesis on water, air, etc. The more socially acceptable terms are pyro- and cryo-, because they're a bit different, as pertaining to manipulating the molecular structure of objects on a different scale. It's all PK, ladies and gents.

Yeah, agreed, in a traditional sense it's all PK but you gotta take account of the latest "tri" variations. Like the Trihydrokinesis tech? That's just way more fixating than the normal hydro. The suggestion is three times but in effect it's perhaps ten times or more depending on whether you can facilitate the Rhesus doublers. Do that then the sky's the limit, of course. But the problem is I've never known anyone who can withstand the Drexel Mexamagaron fallout factor. There's always a first I guess.
