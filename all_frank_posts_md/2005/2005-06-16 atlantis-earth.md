I'm not really serious about this theory, more likely thought it just for fun but what do you think =)
<br>
I accidentally read this line about Atlantis and its from theories of Atlantis.
<br>
<br>
"Most writers who describe ancient Atlantis agree that the Atlanteans attained a zenith of luxury and that it led to their downfall. The ancients said Atlanteans became so materialisitc and hedonistic that they lost their spiritual vision, and turned away from God."
<br>
<br>
So i started thinking about earth and us... where is our future heading? Same as Atlantis people, technology, materialistic etc.
<br>
<br>
Then i started thinking about the movie Matrix and its theory about everything has happened earlier same as now and will happen again and again and again... (also battlestar galactica if i am right)
<br>
<br>
So maybe Atlantis is earth but just in far far in the future =)

To a point, yes, that's pretty much it.
<br>
<br>
The atlantean society was apparently far more advanced both technologically than our current society, with a big emphasis on crystals and earth energies being at the core of their technology.
<br>
<br>
What went wrong was too much reliance on technology, too much advancement without the wisdom needed to handle it properly, so the civilisation more or less self destructed. Some theories put it down to wars, but with whom?
<br>
<br>
It seams a great many Atlantean souls are incarnating at the moment, and working with the higher spirits with the purpose of trying to stop it all from happening again.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I reckon it is all a load of BS myself. I never heard about Atlanteans travelling to the moon or having anything like the technology we have today. As a race I reckon we are far more advanced in all directions. And finally, it would appear, we are making our way out of the Astral Mud regarding these superstitious "spiritual" constructs we have held dear since the Dark Ages.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

ya know..I really wonder about crystals and their true potential...there are so many different energy related things out there about them..maybe that is a true area of technology we have overlooked..can't wait for the day to see advances in this area ..or atleast more public ones

In a sense, Frank is correct.  The Atlanteans did not have technology as we have it today.  No, they didn't have iPods, computers, etc.  Not even cars in the same sense.
<br>
<br>
However, they did have an alternate technology most of which was based on energy generation and manipulation of it.
<br>
<br>
The heart of most of the generation systems they used was focused in huge crystals, some which still remain today.  They used a set of individuals arrayed around the crystals who maintained the control over the energy, transferring flows as needed.  These people were slaves, subjugated to a life that while comfortable compared to others nevertheless was not free.
<br>
<br>
The Atlanteans misused the energy in a variety of ways, often self-serving. They did not respect the slaves controlling the energy.  They wasted it, they played with it rather than use it well, they fought with it.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the downfall of Atlantis was not because of external wars, but because of a rebellion by the slaves who end up bringing down the entire society by destroying the energy centers.  Most of those slaves ended up dying as a result, but chose death over continuing as they had.
<br>
<br>
I will have to go back and remember the details on what the technology was like.  I do remember they could fly, but now that I think of it, I wonder if it was physically or astrally.

<section>
That's really interesting JD. Makes sense too, about the slaves.
<br>
<br>
Everything I understand about Atlantis, not so much from what I've read, but from my own visions and past life experiences, is that we are very much now like they were then just before their civilisiation collapsed.
<br>
<br>
I agree maybe their technology wasn't more advanced than ours, just very different. Either way the slave labour is something both societies have in common, but in our politically corect and moralistically sanitised society, we don't call the "blue collar" workers in factories, mines or construction sites slaves.
<br>
<br>
In both cases I still see much technological potention but not the wisdom to use it properly. If we truly had the wisdom to use our technology properly, we would not have third world countries or massive poverty in the first world countries. I feel we are, like the atlanteans did, allowing our technology to consume us, which could very well be our destruction too.
<br>
