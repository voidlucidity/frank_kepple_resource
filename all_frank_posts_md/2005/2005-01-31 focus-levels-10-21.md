<b>
 Focus 10
</b>
<br>
<i>
 (Mind Awake/Body Asleep)
</i>
<br>
This is the level at which the physical body is asleep but the mind is awake and alert. Consciousness is fully retained without dependence upon signals from the physical body. Conceptual tools are developed that the participant may use to reduce anxiety and tension, for healing, for remote viewing and for establishing resonance with other individuals. In Focus 10, much like the dream state, we learn to think in images rather than in words.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Focus 12
</b>
<br>
<i>
 (Expanded Awareness)
</i>
<br>
This is a state where conscious awareness is expanded beyond the limits of the physical body. Focus 12 has many different facets, including exploring nonphysical realities.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Focus 15
</b>
<br>
<i>
 (No Time)
</i>
<br>
The state of "No Time" is a level of consciousness which opens avenues of the mind that offer vast opportunities for self exploration beyond the constraints of time and place.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Focus 21
</b>
<br>
<i>
 (Other Energy Systems)
</i>
<br>
This level offers the opportunity to explore other realities and energy systems beyond what we call time-space-physical-matter.

So astral projection falls in the Focus 12 category? What about focus 13,14,16 etc.

I like reading through the traditional descriptions of the focus states, they make me chuckle because they sound so old fashioned now.
<br>
<br>
As a model of consciousness I think it's great and the linear progression idea relates well to beginners. The concept of simultaneous time is tad mind-blowing, so the linear progression focus concept relates ever so well to the linear nature of physical events. In any event, it was a definite improvement on the mystical notions of astral-planes and all that jazz.
<br>
<br>
Like Major Tom, I owe a lot to Monroe. I've followed his work for a number of years. He was a true pioneer and some of his explorations must have taken a LOT of courage.
<br>

Astral projection can be located at focus 21 where there is split of some kind with all physical awareness, and an opening up to to other energy systems (astral planes, etc).
<br>
<br>
These are arbitrary numbers, and there is no focus 13, 14, etc.
<br>
<br>
Now, this system of categorizing experiences in terms of focus levels can be quite limiting in itself, as well as more mystical based systems such as astral, mental and buddhic planes supposedly increasingly difficult to reach.
<br>
<br>
I have a for long time operated under the implicit assumption that in order to reach so-called "beyond focus 27" experiences you have to enter it somehow by finding the doorway from an RTZ or even astral type of doorway. After all, the man himself did it way, by developing a relationship with a guide who guided him into these type of experiences.
<br>
<br>
I have nothing but good words for Monroe, his accomplishments are amazing and I wouldn't be where I am without his influence, but it's important to understand where he's coming from and the path many nowaydays try to replicate.
<br>
<br>
He was a concrete thinker in many ways who relied heavily on outward concrete manifestations in his earlier OBE development, and his later "adjustments" are often not given enough importance since everything else seems so much more exciting. Some even dream of writing books without having experienced anything yet!
<br>
<br>
It makes a lot of sense that Monroe started out with such an objectified interpretation of his experiences since after all he did not have that much other information to go with, but it does involve taking the long road. For my own part, I have spend around 50 OBEs solely on the issue in trying to find such a concrete doorway, and plenty more on finding my own INSPEC (guide). It's a waste of very good time.
<br>
<br>
There is no division. One can go "beyond focus 27" (whatever that means) without even ever visiting focus 27, without objectified guidance, or without having to learn all aspects of what lies in between. Straight from focus 10 to beyond 27? I thought it was not possible, but it is.
<br>
<br>
The fact that "the long road" does not exist anymore is in many ways thanks to Monroe himself by adopting the framework of phasing, but even within that system of thought a load of assumptions and hierarchy have been placed on it.
<br>
<br>
Could it really be that it is possible to reach Monroe's pinnacle "the edge of the source and the emitter?" without going the long road? I no longer consider it to be an outrageous idea if one is ready to bear such a thing.
<br>
<br>
I would never tell anyone if I did anyways, since I would have considered it to be too outrageous if someone said so on these boards not so long ago. Not that I did or anything, nor do I even know if Monroe's path is my path.
<br>
<br>
But it does seem that "phasing" if one realizes that the leaps do not have to be small at all, destroys many limiting assumptions about it having to be a slow progression through a never ending hierarchy.
<br>
<br>
Ok..not sure which questions I have answered here...probably just my own
