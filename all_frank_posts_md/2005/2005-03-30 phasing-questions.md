I just got through trying to phase, using BWG Basic Meditation. My body got to the point where it was semi dumb. Couldn't really focus on my hands, felt like they were empty and my legs to and all. My mind was perfectly awake. The thing is I only did this for about 10 minutes. But I have a question about Phasing.
<br>
The images you see are from the Blackness of your closed eye lids right? Its not your imagination mind right?
<br>
The reason I'm asking is because I have had some experiences with seeing images in my close eyelids. Once i was really sleepy, closed my eyes, and suddenly was on a dark road, and on my sides were trees, and it was dark, and i just zoomed trhough it. It wasn't an OBE, because it felt different, my it also felt like my conscious was there, and could direct it back to to my room when ever I wanted. Is that Focus 23?
<br>
<br>
Thank you for answering my questions. I haven't heard about phasing until now.

This is Phasing.
<br>
<br>
What you are doing is shifting your focus of attention to another realm of reality apart from the physical. It doesn't feel like you are actually "travelling" anywhere. Just shifting your attention about. That is also why there is very little fear associated with it. There are no feeling of separation and all that jazz, no thinking you have died and fighting and grappling to "get back" to your physical body. It's just a smooth switch in mental focus. This is also why it's perfect for beginners.
<br>
<br>
Is that Focus 23? Chances are, from what you describe, no.
<br>
<br>
From what you say you phased from Focus 1oC to Focus 2oC. This is perhaps the most common initial shift that people offer themselves. In terms of the Monroe focus states, Focus 2oC doesn't actually translate all that well. This area encompasses the Monroe focus states of F3; F10; F12; F15 and F21.
<br>
<br>
Focus 2oC is what psychologists would call your sub-conscious. It's also the place where your faculty of creative imagination is held (that's where you were by the sounds of it), and the area of consciousness that mystics call the Astral. So it's the place where most people do their astral projecting.
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like you were situated somewhere in the upper branches of your imagination. If there were such a thing, then call it perhaps Monroe focus 19. Problem is, like I say, there is no real direct translation. Monroe kind of missed it out, lol, which is one of the slight problems with the model.

I was just about to ask this same question here.  The funny thing is the fact that my first phasing experience was EXACTLY as you describe here.  I was reading Astral Dynamics and put the book down just to nap for a few minutes, then the darkness behind my eyes opens up an i am traveling down a dark road with trees on either side and am kind of bouncing (like if i was traveling in an Army Jeep or something).  Then, i kind of shook myself out of this phase and completely woke up.  I knew the whole time where my body was, but it felt (SO FAR) away and this image complete engulfed my consciousness.  And while coming back to where I was laying on the couch my consciousness was flicking back and forth for a few moments.  Kinda strange, but that was about seven months ago and I can still remember it very vividly.
<br>
<br>
However, after reading Albert Taylors book he said when you are in the RTZ/Astral that you have magnified senses and it  feels completely real (which holds some people back because of fear).  This is why when I get sleep paralysis I get so scared before exiting because I think the "Intruder" might be there again.  So Phasing might be good because you don't feel the fright. However, this Phase, while unique, did not feel real, in fact one of my lucid dreams felt more "real".  So, if this is phasing was I at the beginning?  Would it have felt more real if I had continued with it?  Is it worth it to phase if it does not feel as real as an OBe?
<br>

Thank you

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Phasing is not a method or technique. It is a particular kind of approach that relates to a totally different model of consciousness. What you did was enter the region known as Focus 2 of consciousness. This is where most people do their lucid dreaming and astral projecting and have all kinds of other whacky experiences such as fighting with "demons" and so on.
<br>
<br>
Basically, you are within the realms of your individual area of mind. The place where you imagination is, where all your personalised belief constructs are held. Here is where you meet all these faculties as an objective reality.
<br>
<br>
As a model of consciousness, the Phasing Model acknowledges what a great percentage of people have overlooked over the years, which is: it's perfectly possibly to shift your perception in consciousness, and not actually change your
<i>
 area
</i>
of consciousness. For the first time ever, in a model of consciousness (well, to my knowledge, let's say) the 4 primary areas of consciousness have been incorporated.
<br>
<br>
These primary areas of consciousness are not places that you travel to. (This also have been very misunderstood for perhaps thousands of years.) They are
<i>
 focuses of attention
</i>
. Monroe was the first person, to my knowledge, to latch onto this, and the development of his linear focus model was his attempt (and a very good one it was too) to incorporate the wider reality in a more scientific way.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing Model was built on the Monroe model and is designed to eliminate the "missing areas" or the parts where Monroe had difficulties explaining and/or comprehending or perhaps didn't know about.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing Model incorporates the action of Noticing. This is the little technique, if you want to call it that, that acts as a kind of kick-starter to set the process going.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
