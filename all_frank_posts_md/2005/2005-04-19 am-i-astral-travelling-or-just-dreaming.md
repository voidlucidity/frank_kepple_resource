Hi all, although Ive had a hand full of OB Es its not a hobby of mine and I dont actively pursue it.
<br>
<br>
I was hoping you guys with more experience could offer up some opinions.
<br>
<br>
Recently Ive had prophetic dreams and quite lucid dreams that feel quite real and just lately Ive often dreamt that im atsral travelling.
<br>
<br>
I had one last night where I was bieng persued by some nasty spirits and had to keep thinking about other locations to escape, I went to Australia then the moon and then remembered that I could slip higher in to another reality and leave them behind, which worked.
<br>
<br>
Any way, a wont drone on any longer...my question is, am I projecting or just dreaming it? it felt like a dream...but also felt pretty real.
<br>
<br>
Thanx Marcus.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
From what you say you, are objectively engaging in a number of types of belief constructs within the area known as Focus 2 of consciousness.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Check out some of my Phasing posts. Focus 2 of consciousness is the place where most of us do our dreaming, lucid dreaming, astral projecting and a load more besides.

Yours,
