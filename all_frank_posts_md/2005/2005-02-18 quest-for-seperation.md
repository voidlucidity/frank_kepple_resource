Hi,
<br>
<br>
Been lurking on the boards for a couple of weeks now. Decided to finally join the conversation. I have started my quest in AP about a month ago. I am reading Astral Dynamics and slowly working my way through the NEW exercises. Since my start of my journey I have experience 4 cases of vibrations with one case a partial OBE ( at least I think so) and 1 very vivid and intense Lucid Dream about having an OBE. My main goal of OBE is to determine if the experience is a product of an overactive brain or proof of a separate and independent consciousness. For Frank sake, I will not rehash the topic of real experience vs. imagination.
<br>
Normally I am very skeptical of paranormal activity and spiritually speaking I have no spirituality. Yet I am keeping an open-minded approach and I hoping I will succeed in my quest.  Actually I have been pleased with my results up to this point.  I am definitely interested in other people progress in their OBE experiences.

Hi,

<br>
Welcome to the AP forums! We'll look forward to your participation here. By the way, you may want to look through our newly opened FAQ forum. There are a lot of good topics there posted by the Moderators. We've tried to anticipate questions that get asked over and over, and cover the answers as best we could in that forum.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Very best,
<br>
