i'm kind of new to astral projection but it is only because i've never known what was happening to me. i'm 24 now and since i was 12 or so i remember the experiences of flying and feeling my astral body lift out of my physical. i thought i was just loosing my mind tho. but my question is most of the things i've read about the subject they say that it mostly happens in the early morning and during your sleep. but every time i go through it, it is always right when i'm trying to go to sleep every night. before i knew what it was it would happen 20 or so times each night before i could actually go to sleep without the feeling of leaving my body. which at the time was a fear. i just wanted to know if this was normal or if what i Â was going through something unique. some people i talk to say that since my whole life i've have "medium" abilities i'm more acceptable to these things. maybe knowing will ease my mind a little. thank you....

Yep, I'll second that. No particular time really. It's just that the sleepy state that comes about after being asleep after a number of hours can help. But people do it in the afternoon or evenings just as easy. Depends on the person I guess. No particular rules, as such. It's just whatever works for the individual in question.
