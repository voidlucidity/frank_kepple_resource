Hello,
<br>
<br>
I just found this section and figured I might as well post an official introduction. I have already posted 3 times in the 'Judaism and early christianity section' under various topics and have gotten no dialogue intercourse yet.
<br>
<br>
I am currently exploring spiritualist/spiritist doctrine and the souls eternal progression - the afterlife and the spirit-realms where souls continue their post-mortal lives. Naturally reincarnation has come up...and I am still undecided over that aspect...but find that some spirit-teachers believe in it...and others do not (or some variations or different interpretations exist). At any rate...in my study of spirit-communications...high or superior spirits from the Spirit-world are consistent to bring forth the same spiritual principles and truths which govern the souls eternal progress.....on earth and in the worlds beyond.
<br>
<br>
My interests related to these topics are mediumship, spirit-travel(this forums forte') and all the wonderful dynamics and laws which govern our spiritual progress. I am also interested in the ministry of soul-retrieval and spirit-rescue missions. I am active in other discussion groups/forums and network with like schools of thought.
<br>
<br>
For more information about 'freelight'....please visit my website(s) which can be accessed via my Profile. In my studies on the souls progress and the afterlife...I hope to write some commentaries/essays on my findings and other creative writings ventures. I have not avidly practiced astral travel......although in dreams and prayer-work....the spirit-vision and ESP is heightened to a greater degree. So..in the arena of intentional astral flight I am a novice. I usually choose to allow the Spirit to lead and guide me in these endeavors......and will only will them when I am more properly trained in the art.
<br>
<br>
I look forward.
<br>
<br>

Hi freelight,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the nice introduction, and welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!

Sometimes it takes a while to get a response to a topic. It could be any number of reasons. I've posted a couple of new topics in the last few weeks or so. As an example, one thread got no responses, and the other quite a few.
<br>
<br>
Regarding spiritualism, there is a topic I posted a long time ago in the Early Christianity forum. It is called "The Rock of Truth" after the title to a book written by a Scottish spiritualist named Arthur Findlay. You may have heard of him. You may be interested in taking a look at that thread. Also, one of our other moderators EOL007 is pretty knowledgable in spiritualist matters, imo, and undoubtedly your paths will meet.
<br>
<br>
Again welcome, and we'll look forward to your participation here!
<br>
<br>
Very best,
<br>
Nick

Hello Freelight, if that's your picture I must say you look remarkably like that bloke in Starwars. :)
<br>
<br>
Hope you like it here.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Thanks so much all,
<br>
<br>
My avatar choice was kind of impulsive.......as I didnt have any that were small enough to use for this forum. So.....I was browsing on a Star Wars site and found some smaller avatars....and went with Obie One Kanobi. I hope this doesnt detract from my own original entity-ship.
