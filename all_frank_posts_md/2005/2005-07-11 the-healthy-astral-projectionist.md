<section>
Moderators,
<br>
<br>
I don't know if this has been done yet, but would there be anyway to put together a poll on for healthy lifestyle and astral projection?
<br>
<br>
Ex: Run a poll on the following: Smoker, Non-Smoker, beer/whisky Consumption, Drugs, Healthy Foods, Amount of Sleep, Time of Projections etc..
<br>
<br>
I think this would really give a great result on success of projections. Narrowing down the possibilities to what affects the projection and what doesn't.

I think this is a really good idea!
<br>
<br>
Too bad nobody else seems to be paying any attention (yet).
<br>
<br>
I keep records of myself, and find that everything is so much better when I avoid all drugs (caffeine too!)
<br>
<br>
I've never smoked, done alcohol or drugs much, so I can't say a lot about those, but just monitoring how much caffeine I have during the day changed a lot for me.
<br>
<br>
As for sleep... my sleep schedule changes all the time, sometimes I go several days without sleep, sometimes I sleep 18 hours at a time, and sometimes I go regular for a while, it doesn't seem to make a difference for me.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Great topic though I shall refrain from publishing details about my lifestyle. People wouldn't believe it anyway and it would appear rather extreme when compared to the average eating habits and activities of a person living in modern-day western society. :)
<br>
<br>
In any event, perhaps people would get the wrong idea. They'd maybe get to thinking that living as I choose to do, is a necessity to being good at this. Of course it isn't.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, the main factors that
<i>
 significantly
</i>
affect a person's success at this art, are their Beliefs, coupled with their Intent, Expectation and Desire. These factors are inextricably linked in the same action-equation in consciousness, with the overiding accent on beliefs I would say.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the post reply!! I've been hearing great things about you and you definitely sound like you've been at this for awhile..
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I don't know if you are aware, but Major Tom and I go back a long way - to the good ole days or Spirit Web, IRC chats Robert Bruce in the early 90's. Major Tom told me about Astral Pulse forum and so far I like what I see.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, What would be nice is if there would be a way to have a anonymous poll so the identity would be kept secret and no one would know who eats what, drinks, smokes etc..etc.
<br>
<br>
I do agree with you on intent, desire, and belief's of this art. It all takes time, practice, and patience. Just like a diet, everyone has their style to lose weight, what works for one, doesn't mean it will work for the other.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I can set up a Poll for you no problem but I'm not sure how you would want to arrange it questions wise. The Poll feature allows a question with a number of options. In it's simplest form it would be something like, "Do you prefer to project mornings or evenings?" Then you would have two options "Morning" and "Evening" and people would vote their preference.
<br>
<br>
You can have multiple answer options to a single question, basically. That is the Poll format. I'm not sure if that will suit your needs. If it will then let me know the question and the answer options you require and I'll set it up for you.
<br>
<br>
Yep, the Major mentioned you to me in a PM. Seems like you two go back a while. All the best to you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Good deal on the poll. Maybe other people can join in and share their thoughts on questions in this poll. Because its actually 'everyone's' poll not just mine.
<br>
<br>
Major Tom bumped into me over at Astral Societies a month ago. Weird how we go our separate ways and eventually return years later. Its nice to be in touch with Major Tom again. He's a great guy!
<br>
<br>
I think basic questions would be:
<br>
<br>
1. Do you eat meat?
<br>
2. Do you smoke?
<br>
3. Do you drink beer-wine?
<br>
4. What time are you able to project
<br>
5. Are your projections occur during lucid dreaming
<br>
6. Do you exercise?
<br>
<br>
Something at least to get this started. I can start putting together a spreadsheet and keep track of this and then submit it to you for approval.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, its morning - I am up early - time to take a nap and project..
<br>
<br>
Thank You,
<br>
<br>

<section>
Well, your questions are listed right there, anyone could just come in here and give a detailed answer to each of your questions in order.
<br>
<br>
It doesn't really need to be set up professionally, does it?
<br>
<br>
Could you just make a topic and list the questions, and we'll list answers?  Multiple choice would leave out details we might need, or that the person answering just wants us to be aware of.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Either way, I hope to see your poll soon.  Good luck!

I think it would be a great idea and helpful for others here on the forum to get a better statistic on "how one projects", what do they eat, smoke, drink, when the projections occur, at what time is favorable, do they eat healthy or junk food, do they recite affirmations before going to bed like prayer, etc..etc.. Really digging deep into this questionnaire's.
<br>
<br>
Maybe this will help or maybe it won't but it surely doesn't mean we can't try.

Tvos:
<br>
<br>
Again, I think this is an interesting idea but the Poll facility we have is not good enough to do what you want. You want a multi-question, multi-answer poll and that's not possible. I'm sorry.
<br>
<br>
The only type of Poll I can set up is a single question with one possible response from a number of possible responses. I can see exactly what you are asking for, you want a kind of survey Poll, rather than a Poll determining the most favourable response to one question. You want multi-questions as well as multi response options. Unfortunately the forum software does not give us that facility.
<br>

Yours,

<section>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
Then lets go with a single question poll based off of "Yes/No" and have around 20-30 really well thought out questions? How does that sound?
<br>
<br>
Here's a web site from William Buhlman on a survey that we could work off of to grab better ideas.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Would there be a way once the poll is completed, can we export the data into a excel spreadsheet and run stats on it?

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
The data unfortunately cannot be exported automatically. But the Poll will keep tabs of how many people voted in total and give a little graphical display of how many people have voted for each answer option. So I guess it wouldn't be all that difficult to enter by hand.
<br>
<br>
The essential thing to remember is in each Poll the software will only let us have 1 question. However, we can have
<i>
 multi answers
</i>
to that one question. So rather than Yes/No if you wanted you could have something like, Definitely/Sometimes/Rarely/Never and that kind of thing. Basically it's up to you.
<br>
<br>
Now, to get around the fact that each Poll can only ask 1 question, we can set up any number of polls as you say. However, we don't want to be swamping a main section with Polls. So what I'm thinking is, we can set up all the Polls in a largely unused section like Forum Bugs and Reports. Then we make a sticky announcement in the more popular sections like OBE Discussions and Chat inviting members to pop to Forum Bugs and Reports to place their vote.
<br>
<br>
All I need is a list of questions and the answer variations for each question and I'll set it up.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank,
<br>
<br>
I'll start working on some questions and submit them to this thread and if everyone else can expand off of it I think it would be a great exciting collaboration.

Speaking of extreme diets. I have a friend who is on an only raw food (including meat) diet. He eats raw beef, fish, pork, eggs and milk right from the cow without fail.Believes he can live to be 300 years old by doing so. He does look fairly young for his age but im surprised he hasnt gotten tape worm yet.

I agree with this very much. Diet, smoking, play too little a role in bothering what is important to succeed.

<section>
Michael,
<br>
<br>
I do believe you are correct in this. Just last night I lighted up a cigarette (one that is) and had some beautiful obe's and a verification with two cards. I do however think that if the physical body can exercise, feel good about itself in diet, foods one can gain more energy mentally, physically, and spiritually.
<br>
<br>
I don't know about your friend and his diet but eating raw foods is just asking for trouble especially with ecoli, Ebola, and tape worm. Each to its own but I wouldn't expect him to live past 50.
