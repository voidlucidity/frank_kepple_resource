I've just started Mastering Astral Projection after mucking around with it a little bit but having very limited success... i really got interested in it when i heard Robert on Dreamland. My Gran had died about 6 months ago who i was very close to and that's my main motivation for doing this! if there is a way i can see her again before i die then I'm there!
