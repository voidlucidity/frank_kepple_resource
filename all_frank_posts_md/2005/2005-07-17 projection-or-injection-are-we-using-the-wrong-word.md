Hello!  I'm back!  Too much school work is keeping me from doing anything I want to do and I keep on running out of Internet credit at school.  Sooooo, VCE should be condemed.  Onto the topic of the post.
<br>
<br>
From what I've been reading recently, it seems when we're talking about AP in a foC way, then saying 'projection' would be rather inaccurate.  To project is to go 'outwards' but we seem to be going inwards so rather, you'd call it astral injection but that word's a bit
<i>
 iffie
</i>
as well as it sounds like you're shooting up on the Astral.  Weird.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, what would you call it if not projection?  There has to be some funky latin word we can pull from somewhere to better describe the process.
<br>
<br>
On another topic, I have been seriously slacking off lately in regards to foC.  I've been meaning to revise my f2oC rundown but I've almost forgotten the basics.  Can anyone refresh my memory in regards to the difference between Franks f3oC and Monroe's, if there is a difference, and what to do to achieve an f2oC state (aside from the rundown, before that).
<br>
<br>
Any comments greatly appreciated!
<br>
<br>

I completly agree. To me it seems more and more like an internal process, rather than some intricate spiritual and / or religious process.

First of all I will refer you the terms of the AUP the link to which is at the top of each page.
<br>
<br>
We do not allow disrespect of anyone here. You have a right to answer posts in a thoughtful and respectful way so please do so or not at all.
<br>
<br>
Astral projection is indeed a projection into your own mind. Your mind is the outermost extension of the infinite mind of The Source, The Infinite Mind, so when we project we project inwards. The Astral "planes" are an inner aspect of our Mind and the Mind of everyone else. When we project we do not go anywhere we are rather focussing our awareness to an inner level of life and reality. We have an infinite number of inner bodies, and a projection is an inner projection to focus within one of these bodies.
<br>
<br>
Mysticism is a religion. Mystics like to think they are special in some way. The fact is tradiational mystical techniques for Astral Projection are very difficult to achieve for 99% of people. Astral projection is intended to be a totally open ability to be enjoyed by all, and that is the objective of Frank and indeed everyone here.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Id like to add in on what Adrian said, it is not to say "its in your head" because it has the inward mark on it, its still very much a nonphysical thing, I really like franks model, realy simplifies it.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I've been absent the past few days as I'm having awful computer problems at the moment. I think my old laptop is finally giving up the ghost after nearly 7 years.
<br>
<br>
I'm really surprised to see the latest crack-pot idea that I am in some way against the book Astral Dynamics. Anyone who would care to search through my past posts will see that I have actually recommended this book over the years. In fact, I have never said a bad word against it and it is the only traditional kinda mystical-orientated book that I actually recommend.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, fanatics of any description are never really interested in the truth. They only see the world through their own very limited perspective and the original poster is certainly no exception.
<br>
<br>
Also, could I please remind "themandude" that registration on my newsletter is a voluntary act. If you do not like it then DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. In other words, do not choose to subscribe to my newsletter and then play the martyr. Like you are reading it under duress. That's a tactic the religious zealots have played over the years and people like myself simply do not fall for it anymore. Unsubscribe yourself by clicking on the link at the bottom of the page and follow the simple instructions. It takes just 3 mouse clicks.
<br>
<br>
Anyone subscribing to my newsletter gets a link to the previous issues that they can read at their leisure. If they do not like what they see they can readily unsubscribe. No one is in any way "forced" to read my newsletter.
<br>
<br>
 I have made my anti-mystical position very clear and have given a number of reasons why I dislike mystics-release-gurus. For example, I present evidence of the situation regarding the mystic-release-guru known by the name of Sai Baba that Robert Bruce has associated himself with in the past together with his followers, such as the member we used to have here who called herself "red catherine".
 <br>
 <br>
 Sia Baba is a suspected sex offender, child molester and serial rapist who has been the subject of reports by the British Foreign Office and UNICEF (among other agencies such as the French government) warning people of his devient activities. I reckon, however, this is just the tip of a very large iceberg of sexual and other devients who abuse their positions of presumed authority to prey on the unwary in all manner of respects.
 <br>
 <br>
 Below I present just one of my posts of many, on the subject of the book Astral Dynamics:
 <br>
 <br>
 ----------------------------
 <br>
 Hello:
 <br>
 <br>
 I found the book very useful in that it got me projecting into the RTZ for the very first time. Prior to reading the book I had had hundreds of "astral projections" over many years, but the RTZ had always eluded me.
 <br>
 <br>
 Astral Dynamics contains ever so many hints and tips and good all-round general information, you cannot help but pick up benefits from it. I'm not at all into the mystical or energy-work side of things, but the book piqued my curiosity about "chakras" and I had a whale of a time exciting these energy centres. It's immense fun.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank
 <br>

Uh... Okay.  Well.
<br>
<br>
So opinions are rather varied and my original thread is now way off topic.
<br>
<br>
So, still on the revised topic.  I happen to have the upmost respect for Frank.  Everyone is entitled to their own views and opinions and no one really is expected to accept them but should at least be courteous and keep their own scathing remarks to themselves and think about how others might feel.
<br>
<br>
Frank's theories are pioneering in a field no one has paid much attetion to until recently and hopefully, one day, there'll be a greater acceptance, until then, we potter away in our own little ways, trying to make a difference.
<br>
<br>
I can marry Frank's ideas with my own religious beliefs in a way I can't really explain yet but the two work together and therefore, I am able to accept his ideas with open arms.
<br>
<br>
If anyone can't, that's your problem and we shouldn't have to hear about it.  It really isn't nice.  So please, back on topic now.
<br>

<section>
Andali, I was very excited to see your post and wrote a long and in-depth examination the word "projection" and its reliance on certain philosophies while exploring new words. We must treat this topic with our best attention because it can help us guide our discourse and increase the rate and potency of our understanding of one another and this phenomenon that's the subject of our discussion
<i>
 and introduce it into non-mystical public discourse
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Alas, I was writing it while in my university library and my login timed out before I clicked "submit" and it was all lost! Before I write something again, I just wanted to make this post right away and say thank you for bringing this up and that I think it's important.

i like what you said adrian! clears up a bit of the lies spread around about people projecting their spirits outside of their bodies (if we even have one that is) and flying around the physical earth. really cleared up alot for me on the differences (if any) between LDs and OBEs. thanks

<section>
Just regarding Major Tom's response regarding the energy work...  I guess my view point as a beginner with regards to the energy work, is that when you start feeling the sensations it creates that little opening in your mind that makes you think "heyy... wait a minute..." and then you get more and more sensations with more and more practise.
<br>
<br>
When you start feeling immediate results from the energy exercises (well, for me anyway) it helps with the slow progress from "well i'll try it out but it probably won't work" to "hey, perhaps this really is true" and then on and on as you then start on other AP exercises.
<br>
<br>
Being someone who has never, in my entire life, experienced anything even remotely "psychic" (the extent of what I've experienced are vivid dreams, not even lucid dreams) I was fascinated by all this but had a hard time believing it could be real.
<br>
<br>
The exercises helped me bit by bit come to terms with it, as I think that if I had a full blown AP without any prior experience of sensations then I would probably freak out - as I wouldn't have been ready to handle it.
<br>
<br>
If I personally wanted to start to learn how to "project" and the first thing that I had read were Frank's newsletters (Frank, this is by no means an insult!!) then I would have been really quite confused.  Having researched a little more however I was able to read it and sorta see what it entailed, but as a beginner I would have been utterly lost and probably have thought "its all too hard".
<br>
<br>
But I am guessing that the newsletter isn't aimed at beginners, whereas the book that is being written probably IS and therefore would probably be a better tool.
<br>
<br>
My last observation regarding looking "inward" is just a personal one on coming to grips with the idea that its "all in my mind".  That's not really a concept that is easy to understand for me, because I've had a couple of AP experiences where I have just rolled out of my  body and walked around my room which gives me the sense of being "out" (Even though I've never maintained the idea that you actually LEAVE your body, just become aware of another level of consciousness).  But I'm going to start these "noticing" exercises in the morning after a good nights sleep to see what the results are (though thus far I've just fallen back asleep again!) because that's when I get the best results.
<br>
<br>
I still have religious beliefs and backgrounds and these are things that comfort me so I'm not ready to dismiss all religions or mysticism (I kinda like some of the mysticism and beliefs) but I love to learn, observe and find out about differing viewpoints on such matters.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for my ramble, its probably not all relevant to this particular post but it was just some of my thoughts.

Judging by how Frank feels about religion, I say he'd find that comment would 'clash' with his beliefs.

<section>
Well Andali if you don't think the the term astral 'projection' is appropriate, then why not change it to astral intromitting.
<br>
<br>
What is 'intromitting' I hear you say. well below is what the Encarta dictionary has to say.
<br>
<br>
in·tro·mit [ ìntrə mít ] (past in·tro·mit·ted, past participle in·tro·mit·ted, present participle in·tro·mit·ting, 3rd person present singular in·tro·mits)
<br>
<br>
transitive verb
<br>
insert: to cause or allow something to enter something else ( formal )
<br>
<br>
[15th century. From Latin intromittere  "to send in," from mittere  "to send" (see mission).]
<br>
<br>
I think since we are attempting to enter into rather than exiting ourselves this might seem to be a little more apropos.

Hmm ... well "projecting" is better at least than "injecting", I mean, how would it be if people started telling other people who didn't know anything about the subject:
<br>
<br>
"Hey, Bob, what've you been up to?"
<br>
<br>
"Wassup, Ron? Oh, I was just injecting. It was incredible."
<br>
<br>
"Injecting?!"
<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I like to inject at least once a day."

i sense tension between the mystics and the phasers!  can't we all just get along! i mean here we are on the verge of something great, a new understanding of our world,our reality, ourselves and we are still fighting over details...this is what makes me sick about religion!!!! can't we all look at the big picture! the overwhelming similarities! why do people have to die because my god is named this and your god is named that...we agree there is a god...and something so special and magnificent is going to care what you call him...damn there should not even be a word for her/it/___/him. so now we are going to argue about who is more right phasing or mystic style....commmmmon!

People argue because something doesn't add up between them. Maybe not all arguing is productive, but sometimes it leads to better understanding. If someone says something that to you is blatantly wrong, why should you just accept it? If everyone did it, there would be utter chaos. No part of language would mean anything anymore, a square would be a circle, and on and on.
