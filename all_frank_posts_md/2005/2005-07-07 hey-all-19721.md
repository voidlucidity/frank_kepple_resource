Hello everyone, I'm new to Astral Pulse as of today
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
The spark of interest in astral projection came from my favorite band Tool. Ever since I have learned about astral projection and the experiences it can provide I can't keep it off my mind. It is the one thing that I am almost always thinking about. I hope that I can make some friends and learn from everyone on the forum.

Tool is an excellent band, I love their "Lateralus" album(especially "Parabola" and "Lateralis" tracks). I couldn't stop smiling when I heard "Lateralis" track first time, it was the best song about the OOBE I ever heard.
