<section>
In an F1/F4 overly, would it be possible for me to have the impression that I was talking directly to someone, although I was still aware of my physical surroundings and sensations and that the person I was communicating with was nowhere near the vacinity of my physical F1 focus of awareness? (maybe to describe it as talking mind to mind is not exactly the best way to describe such an occurance)
<br>
<br>
Also, would it be possible that if I were to talk about that part of that person focused here on planet Earth, would it be possible for that person not to  know of the communication, unless he had switched his awareness to F4?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
F1/F4 overlays are very profound events. I only ever managed to do it twice so far. It's wild, whacky and freaks you out. Well, it sure does me! You see the physical, and overlayed on that you perceive the concepts behind the actions you are currently experiencing. Sort of like deja-vu on steroids. :)

<section>
Hrm, would you be able to go into more detail or give an example of this happening to you?  I think I know what you mean when you say "you perceive the concepts behind the actions you are currently experiencing."  However, if you could describe an action you were doing and then describe the perceived concepts behind that action, then I would know for sure.
<br>
<br>
lol!  Deja-vu on steroids!  what have you been smoking? hehe

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I realise you were joking but, for the record, I've never actually taken any of the mind-altering drugs, or smoked weed, that kind of thing. I used to drink moderate amounts of alcohol on a strictly social basis. But that's about it.
<br>
<br>
In terms of actions I was doing, I'm talking about just simple ordinary stuff like breathing, moving a finger, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

This is most certainly not what was occuring with me.  I have no idea what the concept behind breathing or moving a finger would be.  In fact, the very thought is mind boggling to me.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know but thought I'd better mention it as people might start getting the wrong idea, especially where talk of Primary Focus 4 is concerned. :)   Thing is, it's darned difficult for me to explain as these kinds of experiences are relatively new for me, not so much PF1/PF4 overlays but PF4 experiences proper. Note: I now use the term Primary Focus for the main areas, as people were getting a tad confused between those and the Monroe individual focus states.
<br>
<br>
Primary Focus 4 of consciousness is the subjective source of all the actions in consciousness. You see, the energy for our actions has to come from somewhere. We don't just create something from nothing. An idea, for example, is an action in consciousness. It is energy with a particular direction, you could say. Now that energetic action had to be sourced from somewhere, in the sense that the raw energy didn't just come from nowhere.
<br>
<br>
When we look at ourselves in terms of energy, what we are is essentially a human energetic transducer that converts raw subjective energy into objective becomings of all manner of description. I wrote a little piece on PF4 in relation to a question about reincarnation a little while ago and much of what I said in that piece is relevant. So here it is:
<br>
<br>
When we project within subjective reality, each of us typically places ourselves in the position or anticipation of facing objects. But when you enter Primary Focus 4, you cast off all notions of "things" and begin merging with the underlying subjective energy. That same energy, down the line, as it were, will ultimately split off here and there (again all in a manner of speaking) and create a "thing". That thing could be a soccer ball, a human being, a house, a plant, a giraffe, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Now, in merging with energy, I do not mean you are merging into a vast pool of nothingness. On the contrary, typically, you are merging with a specific
<i>
 action
</i>
of energy. I suppose you could say, in a very broad sense (and only in a very broad sense) you are merging with a "thing" but a thing in terms of its conceptualisation, or it's source in other words. And that source of all that is within our system is Primary Focus 4 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
So, ultimately, all "things" can be traced to an action in energy, the ultimate source of which is Primary Focus 4. So you could say that Primary Focus 4 is the area of the action of the thought before it is created. But again, only in a manner of speaking because, from the Primary Focus 4 standpoint, there is no before. All simply is. The concept of "before" comes into it as the action is engaged further "down the line" as it were.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
I think I am getting my head around the concepts you are trying to express.  However, it is still confusing.  To talk about something as it is at its source is hard for me to come to terms with.  I guess from the point of view of a person who is focused in PF1, it is difficult to come to terms with the idea that "all simply is."
<br>
<br>
I'm just wondering where the creativity comes into play.  This may be a terribly silly question, but does it get incredibly boring being in PF4?
<br>
<br>
How is it possbile for the subjective to become objective?
<br>
<br>
Is raw subjective energy energy that has not passed through any process of conceptulaization?  It just simply is and then I can use it to create anything?  (Like molding clay?)
<br>
<br>
To merge with that subjective energy seems even more mind boggling!  How do you maintain any level of awareness?  Are you even you at that point?

<section>
I was curious if you believe many people experience PF4 here and there and don't even realize what it is?  What you describe is giving this familiar ring to it, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
<br>
When you describe 'action of energy' are talking about the process of getting to the object? OR... are you talking about being completely engulfed in a thought and being in complete understanding.
<br>
Sometimes I'll be in certain modes of sleep and I'll come thoughts such as "this is this and thats that, just because it makes total sense" and when I wake up I'll be thinking, how the hell did that make sense?! (if I can even remember the process, which I generally forget most)   Im guessing this is what you are speaking of?? I experience this here and there, and it is very much 'it just is' sort of sensation.

What kind of knowledge, Frank, have you gained from reaching PF4. Would you be willing to expand on the PF4 experience like what you actually do there?

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I've been reading this post with much fascination. What a wonderful concept!
<br>
Though I confess to still being really bad at grasping some of the terminology used here, I feel that I have, a few times, experienced the event you are speaking of.
<br>
<br>
As an habitual meditator, I've had occasions where I've felt like things have been all lit up around me. I'll open my eyes to look at the surroundings of the park where I usually go to meditate, and I feel like I'm looking at much more than the physical objects - I'm also looking at their energies, their essences. Trees, and even the rocks seem to glow.
<br>
It can be a rather mind boggling experience, like you're frozen in time and looking at the very heart of things. This goes far beyond seeing the spirits aound me that I often do.
<br>
<br>
Though I'm coming at things from a different angle to your experiences, does this equate to what you've detailed here?
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,
<br>
James.

If you want to get a good idea of what a f1/f4 overlay is...smoke a good deal of pot.  The feeling you get when immensely tuned into your thought process as well as physically sensing is the result...which is why it freaks people out.  It's also why people seem to have such pivotal thoughts--making simple connections they didn't before.  Smoking gets such a bad rap because how much it is abused by people today--which IS bad...It was used long ago for strictly spiritual reasons..connecting with the essence or whatever they did

.  But no, I don't want to get this into a boring drug debate...just stating my belief.

<section>
lol, someone figured out the inspiration of my post.
<br>
<br>
which is good, because it answers the question that I did not ask.
<br>
<br>
However, it still seems to me like Frank goes a little deeper and the general impression I get from reading Frank is that it is not exactly the same thing.
<br>
<br>
But if it is the same then wow!  a lot of things start falling into place for me.  It means that I've ventured into these trans-dimensional areas of consciousness, but only briefly since I start to loose all sense of who I am.  makes me feel like I am going to die so I am immediately snapped back to physical awareness.

<section>
I depends on the person really.  Some people can tune in more naturally than others or think about these things alot more(law of attraction).  I have had some crazy experiences.  And if I'm with my friends and Im in the right zone and start talking randomly, they look at me and say in awe "damn... you're psychic or something'.
<br>
<br>
I would say the only way you could really go deeper is if you fade-out of the physical into some sort of trance state.  I believe I have experienced this many times but usually once in a long while.  And nope, I didnt smoke these times

Frank:
<br>
<br>
I've had a similar experience as halfphased's, only it was here in the physical. All day yesterday, I felt like my deceased grandmother was trying to contact me, and perhaps that she was following me in spirit.
<br>
<br>
I think the reason may be because I'm moving out into my first apartment tomorrow, and she's watching me go through this huge transition in my life.
<br>
<br>
Is this another example of an F1/F4 overlay?
<br>
<br>
Do you know of any way I can communicate with her? (If not, I understand).
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>

interesting post...i was thinking the other day about this. drugs force our awareness into other focus levels so why cant some drugs give you an f4 overlay? i imagine alot of the "feelings" that people experience have to do with F4... would be interesting to explore this further.

<section>
Kodemaster,
<br>
It's funny you say that, I experience this from time to time with my recently decease grandmother of whom I was close too.  I usually ask for her to visit while I'm asleep and she'll come into my dream state(whichever 'focus' that is) and she'll give me a sort of sign or symbol in the midst of the dream that validates that it was real, not just some imaginative thing.  When it occurs it's a very vivid dream with a deep and personal connection as well.  I would say this is your best bet also.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow you can communicate otherwise, I don't believe f4 is connected in anyway.  It's more of just sensing her energy impulses.  If I had to guess it's more of a f1/f2 and not just for you but for her as well.

<section>
I guess I should clarify my original post.  When I was talking about communicating with someone, it seemed that I was talking to a physical person... but not the physical part of that person.  It felt more like I was merged with that person.  For all intents and purposes I was that person when the communication was occuring.
<br>
<br>
It is hard to describe.  Perhaps it would be more clear to say that I felt I was merged with the subjective energies of the person I was communicating with.  (Not that I am exactly sure what I mean by 'subjective energies', although they feel like the correct words to use.)
<br>
<br>
My concern was that if this was happening at PF4, then it is possible that if the person was only aware of PF1 at the time that they would not be aware of the communication.

<section>
Halfphased,
<br>
I believe we are talking about the same thing here.  You start feeling the same emotions as the person next to you, and you go to speak and the person does so as well.  And while it's happening you know exactly what the person is gonna start talking about.  When this started happening to me I was totally blown away.
<br>
<br>
But yeah, it like you communicate by energies only.. and the perons starts to respond in the way that they should respond... is this what you mean??
<br>
Anyways... I'v always wondered that myself..are they really thinking the same thing?? or do they just have no clue, and think it's natural .
<br>
<br>
I had another thought about F4 in general as well...  We have ourselves the physical and inside us is this energy system/body/soul/aura... And this aura theoretically expands infinately.  But just like a gas of some sort... the further it exands from the source the less dense it becomes.  Now, while our primary focus being the physical, the source would be inside of us.
<br>
<br>
The further you go from the source the energy is less dense or (in energy terms) of a different/higher frequency.  When we tune into f2 or f3 we would be tuning into a higher frequency of ourselves. Thus we are able to function at a much faster pace... this also gives notion to the concept of there being no time because at an infinately fast pace there is no pace at all... it all just is.
<br>
<br>
Now we also see that in f4 all just is... perhaps it is because all beginning and endings connect...
<br>
Anyways, my brain is frying at the moment...
<br>
<br>
Anyone.. feel free to comment or criticize..please!
