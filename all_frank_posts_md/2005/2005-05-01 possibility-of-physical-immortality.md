Hi
<br>
Do you think it is really possible for a man to live forever ie physical immortality, like Count Saint Germain for example?
<br>
Apologies if this has been discussed b4 but I searched couldn't find anything &amp; it seemed like a good topic 4 discussion.

Yes I believe it's possible.  But know this:  God would VERY rarely give someone a "gift" of physical immortality, if even it all(maybe it's happened, who knows).
<br>
<br>
With that aside, immortality comes with a heavy price.  Such as making a pact with a demon, or selling your soul.  Even then you'll get screwed out of the deal, because evil cannot be trusted.  So yeah it's probably possible but it's something that should NOT be pursued for any reason.

lol. if you could tell me how i would go about selling my soul i would love for it. An faq perhaps?
<br>
<br>
seriously though, it is my belief that nothing is "impossible" per the definition, but to be able to step outside our construct of time would be quite the achievement

Where did you learn such things?
<br>
<br>
There is no natural law which says that death is a necessity. Its a technological problem to be solved. Death is a result of accumulation of errors during DNA replications which happen as cells divide.
<br>
<br>
In not very distant future average humans will be able to live 300 years or so, which I think is long enough for you to do everything you always wanted to do. But there are still things such as diseases and accidents.
<br>
<br>
The permanent solution that I can think of is to grow bodies in factories and simply transfer your consciousness to a ready made body by leaving the old one, if it gets old or damaged or if you get bored of it.

There ! you have a point. Exactly...
<br>
Right now we dont have a control, we are born and get stuck. Its like you hire a car to go somewhere but get stuck inside it, and cant come out till the car itself breaks down. Even if the car is made of gold, this sucks.
<br>
<br>
If the fiction of factories of bodies comes true, and we can leave and enter the body as and when we wish, we can return here anytime. Just hire a body after 500 years again and take a look around, live and enjoy if you find it cool, and if its still a mess, swipe your card and move on.

<section>
Well there are already artificial and prosthetic limbs and a few organs. I don't think it'll be too long now 'til theres a mechanical version of every bodypart.
<br>
<br>
Then all you'll need is a brain... which some world leaders seem to be coping pretty well without anyway.
<br>
<br>
So really the only question is how long can the brain survive, as that seems to be the only thing holding us in this body.
<br>
<br>
I am well aware that who we are isn't just a brain, but the brain is like the control panel for our conscience. It's the only body part we really need to still be who we are. So as long as the brain stays healthy we can still communicate our conscience correctly.
<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe in the future humans will no longer be made of flesh, but instead, robots with a brain.

It very well may be that those humans who are conciously immortal my not need a physical body most of the time.  If your body became a perfect vehicle for the life force that powers it you might be able to, in fact, physically ascend.  When, and if, necessary, assume or precipitate your self a physical vehicle.

I suppose it is pertinent to ask why we should want to live forever, especially as our being on this forum would suggest we believe in the afterlife.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Death is the last great taboo. I think when people begin to realise the truth of the wider reality they will progressively learn to accept the process more and more. Then perhaps they won't be quite so fearful in their physical lives, and then they'll live longer as a result.
<br>

Yours,

If what comes after life is better, why not go there right now? Oh, but we have to learn our lessons and come back to earth until we fulfill them all.
<br>
<br>
If a person could extend his youth for 100s of years, he could shorted his time in the physical realm. Why? Because a person would not spend dozens of years either being a) too young  or b) as too old.
<br>
<br>
In example, what kind of life is more productive
<br>
1 life of 180 years spent as a young man
<br>
vs
<br>
2 incarnations 90 years each?
<br>
<br>
Of course 1 longer life. Why? For starters you do not have to go through childhood twice, you don't have to suffer through old age when debilitating diseases do not allow you to think clearly and act freely.
<br>
You have lots of time to put the pieces of the puzzle together, without any gaps of time in between productive years, you could accumulate much more wisdom in longer time, etc.
<br>
<br>
I think there are advantages of super prolonging youth. Of course only few may get it, due to environmental issues and the fact that there is a pyramid of life (I don't know how to say that).
<br>
<br>
My humble 2 cents...

<br>
Not necessarily.  If someone chooses to live an unproductive life in their first incarnation, then that life, no matter how long it is, is not very productive.  Where as if they died and in their second incarnation they got just the life they needed to progress well than that 1st death might have been an okay thing for them.
<br>
<br>
I don't think our lives need to be any longer.  I think there are more cons than pros.
<br>
<br>
First I think overpopulation would probably be way more of a factor than it already is.
<br>
<br>
And second I don't think we would develop as fast mentally and spiritually everyone knew they were going to live longer.  I know it's fiction but if anyone has read any Dragonlance novels, the elves in those books are an example.  While they live longer than anyone I believe their adolescence lasts at least 3X or 4X longer than a humans.  They would be 30 or 40 years old.  And while they may look like they are in their early 20's they act and think like a teenager.

<section>
death is part of the  healing/ascension process  already mentioned above the only ones who can live here for thousands of years are ascended masters  who are in total service to great spirit ~  they already went through   physical death got to the higher reality then go back down to physical reality to recapitulate  some lesson for humanity  once down here they don't have all the power that they had in the higher realms but they do have tremendous Light  that does impact humanity on many levels  ,Think of the being on the planet called Maitreya  you can find references on the web for him !  a returning Buddha
<br>
from what I believe is true he has  already going though the ascension process ,  the first person   and he appears on the planet  level and many places all at once!  You then get the idea it is more about the process in the now time not the end result. Take you life for instance DO YOU WANT TO FOCUS on immortality or creating more quality of life virtuous life and the shakti and shiva can unite  thus in form of immortality is in ever breath in and out ~  that is the process you need to focus on !

Hi! Very interesting! I have also been thinking that if i could chose right now between living forever here or die now what would it be. What would you chose? Would you take the risk to live eternally? Could it be an eternal hell with suffering that does not end?
<br>
<br>
If there is life after this as seems to be the case then my guess is that there is no "better place". We make it heaven or hell right where we are.
<br>
<br>
I also thought about the feeling; Ahh another day tomorrow or what will i do on Sunday 76495937058034534535 days from now. But time is just in our minds many say. I believe so and have seen some "evidence" that points in that direction. Maybe reality is just a NOW. So then there is no need for the time suffering either.
<br>
<br>
Have you experience that you get more easily sick when you have been sad? I get cold much more easily then. I believe science has proven that we by thinking affect the immune system and also hormones. According to those who teach Kahuna or magic this power is stronger if we do this in brainwaves of Theta/Delta.
<br>
<br>
I heard about a woman who made her eyes rounder and got a tan. Just by thinking. It seems thoughts exists in another dimension and can become reality also here.

This is a very interesting website:

Physical immortality is one thing, concious immortality is another.  A worthy goal would be to be able to remain concious as an integrated personality from body to  body.  It would mean having concious conrtol over the forces that form the levels of conciousness and the forces that make physical bodies
<br>
<br>
I do think that Matrieya is already an ascended personage.
<br>
<br>
<br>
From what I understand of the term 'ascension', it is the ultimate refinement of the physical body to the extent that it may be taken up or discarded at will, conciously.

On rare occasions some object or event triggers a recall, so vivid and detailed with colors and sounds, that it is enough to convince me that memories are never lost.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure many of readers must have had same experience.

so i guess the real question is: are these memories erased after each physical lifetime? Does it even matter? You are obviously outside of physical "time" when you permanently lose physical focus, so whos to say that you are chronologically "after" your last physical lifetime?
<br>
<br>
Im a big fan of the "all lifetimes happen at once" type of thinking. Any memories of the past are simply bleed throughs of other physical focuses.

Ben,
<br>
Coincidentally I was reading something on Morphogenetic fields, where I found something which supports what I said :

 In considering memory, it is helpful to begin by making a distinction between retention and recall. Retention is the ability of the mind to take in and store information while recall is the ability to bring a particular piece of information back to conscious awareness. How good is our retention? There is considerable evidence that our retention is much better than our normal recall would lead us to expect - indeed we may retain all of our experience. For example, under hypnosis, people regularly recall whole chunks of their past with considerable detail. Likewise brain stimulation experiments using tiny electrodes have enabled people to vividly relive random previous experiences with great accuracy. The limiting factor in "memory" thus seems to be recall.

So now that you've brought up the problem of losing memories after each reincarnation, I have a possible explanation and possibility that memories are not lost completely after reincarnation (assuming there is such thing as reincarnation).
<br>
<br>
During a lifetime, all experiences, perceptions and learning are stored in information fields called Morphogenetic fields. Nothing is wasted. In fact it is a great pool of collective memories, with a limited access to group memories for a particular individual.
<br>
<br>
When one is born again, he loses the ability to recall many of his own memories but is influenced by the pool subconsciously. It really depends upon the evolutionary status of an individual if he can recall anything from this pool upto the last detail. Thus it is not the loss of memories but the loss of ability to recall them consciously is responsible factor.
<br>
<br>
We all are familiar with our erratic recalling skills. Sometimes we forget a small number just when we need it urgently (eg ATM pin), sometimes a single word brings back a full song with all the music in its full glory.

The morphogenetic fields sounds like Akashic records. (just noticed
