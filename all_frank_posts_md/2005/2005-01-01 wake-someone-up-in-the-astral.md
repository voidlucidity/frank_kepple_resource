Hi everyone,
<br>
I was wondering if it is possible for someone who is astrally projecting, to  wake up someone who is dreamingand thus en-able them to astrally project as-well.  Is it possible?

It's possible to pull the astral body out when both people are in physical and awake, although EXTREMELY hard.

It might be possible, but far more difficult than people realize.
<br>
<br>
Just telling a person to wake up won't get you anywhere, and any interaction with dreamer tends to be received in symbolic form by the recipient and not necessarily similar to the environment of the projector. Getting on an airplane seems to be a favorite symbol for those helped with OBEing in the dream state.
<br>
<br>
I have entered other people's dreams and helped out in some of these dreams with whatever they trying to work out, but that's still a long shot from getting them lucid or OBE. Not too mention that entering others peoples dreams is usually a good recipe of losing lucidity yourself as you get involved in the dreamers environment
<br>
<br>
My guess is it requires a tremendous (intuitive) background knowledge from the projector to slowly move the dreamer into a scenario where he/she might become lucid, and then still nothing is guaranteed. Still, the idea is fascinating.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
People in the sleep-state tend to limit themselves to specific areas of consciousness that are highly subjective. So by definition they don't have any objective knowledge of what they are doing. Under such circumstances, making any kind of contact is next to impossible (as Major Tom has also pointed out). It's not a question of waking them up. They are already fully awake, but they are deeply engaged in subjective action.
<br>
<br>
The actions people engage themselves in are many and varied. They could be doing anything from just wandering aimlessly alone, to engaging in some complex mass-consensus scenario involving maybe thousands of people all playing various "roles"... and anything else in-between.
<br>
<br>
You ask if it is possible, well, just about anything and everything is possible within consciousness. There is only
<i>
 one
</i>
thing within the wider reality that is actually impossible, but it doesn't relate to this at all. So, yes, it is definitely possible but at present rather difficult for us to accomplish.
<br>
<br>
The best I ever managed to do, to date, is I've had three people come to me to say they had a dream where I played some kind of part and, on these occasions, the person was someone I had actively tried to contact and they had no knowledge of it beforehand. Problem is, though, I have had a number of occasions where I tried to contact people and they did not say they dreamt about me. Plus, I have had people say they made contact with me in their dreams and I have no knowledge of it. So, apart from those three definite hits, everything else has been very hit and miss.
<br>
<br>
I think perhaps your best chance of making it work is if two people agreed on some kind of codeword or phrase beforehand, that one would suggest to the other to "come awake" on hearing the word or phrase. Plus, I wonder if it might not work better if the people knew each other fairly well on a personal level.
<br>
<br>
Despite our current difficulties, I do feel that objective knowledge of dream contact will be something that definitely gains in popularity as people broaden their awareness, and begin to offer themselves progressively more objective knowledge of their subjective actions. I can envision a time, not too far in our future, in perhaps 10 or 15 years from now, where the possibility of meeting someone within your dreamscape will be as accepted within ordinary society as meeting someone down your local high street.
<br>
<br>
I actually think this aspect will start a new kind of "craze" that causes this whole topic to "take off" amongst ordinary people.
<br>
<br>
At present, it's all still firmly in the clutches of the mystics. But I reckon one big thing is going to come along and have the effect of sweeping away all the dark-age doom and gloom, which still haunts this topic today. This will have the immediate effect of making it very palatable for people at large and, as I say, I think this meeting-up in dreams aspect is going to be it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I had a dream where I was being attacked and Frank was there on the side lines, just watching..lol

You could have helped instead of watching..

Kidding, kidding..  Seriously though, I've talked to a few people that were in my dreams to have them say..."how in the world did you know what my house looked like?"
<br>
<br>
I can't answer that.....

The following has happened in 1998. At that time P. my best friend, his carnivore plant and myself used to sleep in the same collage room. Having our exams taken we were stoned all the time. After a lunch and some good smoke we decided to take a nap. For some reason I woke up in my dream body and got up from the bed. It was empty but I saw P. laying slack on his own. I remembered him coming home late and disturbed my projection attempt. Now his laziness got me angry. I grabbed him at his neck and pulled him out to the passage like he were a weightless puppet or something. It was utterly weird and I never forget his funny, surprised face as I happily ran with him through the passage moving him like a kite. I woke up before we reached the exit. He was still sleeping and I forgot to tell the story. On the next day however, he has described his "weird dream." He said he woken up in terror seeing me acting like a jerk, grabbing his hair and pulling him out of the bed then dragging through the passage. Our story was the same except I remembered grabbing him at his neck.

<section>
good account upstream, thanks for that!
<br>
<br>
Frank &amp; Nay, was that a joke or did you actually manage a shared experience?
<br>
<br>
Douglas
<br>
<br>
PS I am always impressed by shared experiences as these would go a long way to convincing people *here* as to the reality of these experiences.. unfortunatly, the subjective nature of it makes such 'objective' verifications very difficult.. hense the dismissal by sceptics, including scientists.
<br>
I like scientists and am in fact a big fan of science as they have done much to help us understand the physical and to manipulate it (although not always positivly of course)... I wouldnt be typing on this keyboard without it.. but imo scientists should stick to what they are good at.. which is learning, understanding and manipulating the physical world.. one of the biggest lessons i learned a while back was that scentific methods, based as they are on objective interpretation methods, are fine (and indeed essential imo) for the physical but absolutly useless for anything beyond that.
<br>
<br>
But for this reason, I am not overly hopefull that the majority of the population will ever be convinced.. but perhaps thats how its meant to work.. the majority carries on as usual and every so often individuals decide to drop out of it as it were.. but everyone else goes on regardless.
<br>
Perhaps actually getting to the point where you go against the grain of everyone else and 'twig on' to how it works is an essential part of the learning curve.

It was real for me... there he stood off to the side, I kept hearing in my head "Frank, Frank, Frank" I had no idea what he looked like back then and don't really suppose it would've made much of a difference because I didn't stare too long at him, I was busy trying to get this freak off me..lol
<br>
<br>
The experience did end pretty quick AFTER I saw whom I thought to be Frank.
<br>
<br>
I do hope Frank didn't mean he brought me into that negative experience, perhaps he meant he brought me into the awareness of him??  Heck, I have no idea..
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
This happened back when Frank was still sorta absent from the forums and at that point I'd only had a few conversations with him as a newbie to the Astral Pulse.
<br>
<br>
I had a dream about wantsumrice, and described part of his house to him..  I saved him from being pulled down into this hole that opened up in the ground..lol  yeah, weird.
<br>
<br>
My mother and I had the same exact dream about a house standing alone in a field (gosh, eons ago)  and my hubby and I had the same dream of a tornado on a beach, so I guess you could say we remembered being together.
<br>
<br>
Edit:  I guess I should say we didn't wake each other up, we were already in the dream, but it was uncanning how we described it to a tee.

<br>
Yes it is.But there are some prerequisite skills
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///needed.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 needed.You
</a>
must be able to project at will with recall to the desired location .You need to be clairvoyant enough to see the energy body of the dreaming mate . They may appear in auric colours or one colour alone . You may not be able to see their body only their head . My friend moved to Queensland and I tired to project with her . I was surprised to find her looking like a beach ball on a pillow . Her energy body seemed not only invisible but it had no depth it seemed flat . I am sure this is because the colours could not be seen through her doona . You need to be able to interact with them so you will want to have a developed enough energy body that you can send your energy or project your voice .
<br>
<br>
My daughter describes it  like this : " You need to trace their energy thru the look of their face and their name is best . You do not need to know the location of their home . You search for them not their home . You stand at the end of the bed and will your thumb and pointer fingers to send a pull to their toes . Sending voice is harder still . You see a tunnel from your mouth to their ear and send your message down that it will sound like underwater until you develop this ability .You can also enter their dreams and to do that I ask to speak to their higher self and ask permission to enter the dream . I tell them why and they pop you in . When you get in you try to send pictures '
<br>
<br>
When you first enter dreams of others you may not see in colour you may see instead as they do or you may be developing your clairvoyant dream sight still yourself  . Realise that there is a dream continuum too .
<br>
So some dream in black and white with no depth or sound or recall all they way up to interactive dreams with all senses and full recall .
<br>
<br>
EASIEST
<br>
projecting
<br>
going to a mate
<br>
giving a hug
<br>
pulling a toe
<br>
sending a message
<br>
sending your voice
<br>
making them understand to go with you
<br>
helping each other to recall the adventure
<br>
HARDEST
<br>
<br>
try to choose a time and place to project and to go
<br>
confirm this before you go to sleep by calling each other on the phone
<br>
then try it each night until it works .
<br>
<br>
We have found one usually gets there but the other does not recall because of the brain state the deepness of the sleep stage . And When we fly together it is sad that we still do not recall it always . My circle gets toes pulled by my daughter and we go to class at dreamtime. We look to see each other there and it is confirming when the others recall you being there or not .

Very easy...
<br>
If one is advanced enough they can see the sleeping persons Astral Body lying there above there physical body (RTZ)
<br>
Some people think they can see there Astral Body but it's only because they want to see it... It's not real though.
<br>
If you can see them it is very easy to wake them up in there astral body...
<br>
But it must be done very gently... That means no going up and shaking the hell out of there Astral Body...
<br>
<br>
I have done this thousands of times
<br>
I have been projecting as long as I can remember so for me it is easy
<br>
For someone that hasnt been APing so long it is harder but very possible.

I've tried this with my sister. I started pulling her left arm - trying to pull her out of body. In my perception I managed to, I told her what was happening and showed her how to float, and move through objects.
<br>
THe day after, in her experience, at the time of my projection she woke up to find a 'black smokey looking' man standing over her bed reaching out for her.
<br>
Not sure what happened, but it was interesting either way.
