Anyone ever thought about this?
<img alt=":?:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I mean, an accomplished APer could literally go anywhere and everywhere.  Why hasn't anyone tried it simply by thinking about it?  I mean, if we ever wanted to know if the givernment was hiding UFOs in area 51,
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
why couldn't we go and see?  Or what really goes on in the President's office?  A network of successful APers could be enough to reveal the best kept secrets of the world, the New World Order aka Illuminati, I mean come on!  We have the access!  The CIA discarded all their psychic programs because of funding and such
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
but we know it it all so why can't we simply go and check out the truth behind Area 51 or even the most top secret organizations like the CIA, and other spy agencies?
<br>
<br>
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this and if anyone has tried it or have know decided to, let us know!

Simple. Reality fluctuations. It's hard enough to stay in the RTZ without adding projecting to a place you've never been and an expectation of finding aliens
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Anything anybody found out would be so suspect as to make the whole thing moot, as the odds would be too high that they'd simply seen whatever they wanted/expected to see, rather than what was really there.
<br>
<br>
Besides, everybody knows government agencies have demons patrolling secret areas to keep out OOBE'ers

Hi Andali,
<br>
It's possible to do as you say, the proof for that is remote viewers can get clarity on foreign targets.
<br>
<br>
Astralspinner brought up a good point in a good humored way...  we would have to expect some form of Psychic patrol or field to prevent people from entering the most sensitive places.
<br>
<br>
I've wanted to get a group together to infiltrate the Mind-Control programs within the US government/military complex !  No one wanted to help out !

Well honestly, from what I can tell, advanced projectors are rare. Most people who project aren't even in full control of the process. I believe everything you talk about is definitely possible, but you'd have to be fully conscious and fully in control. Not only that, but you'd have to do more than just say what you saw or what happened; you'd have to figure-out a way to provide people with proof that you're for real.
<br>
<br>
Tell you what- when I'm advanced enough (which shouldn't be long actually
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
), I'll let you in on a government secret or two, AND provide proof.

Not sure if it is necessary to provide such proofs to others about our experiences..  although there are exceptions to this, such as giving proofs during Messenger contact with another member, while a portion of my Awareness is projected to their house.

Other than that, if I were to project and see classified information, it is not important to find a way to prove it..  most people aren't about to believe you anyway !  Not until the majority of people can think beyond the daily grind, into far reaching concepts, will that change.

My advice is unless you know what you are doing and where you are going, I generally would steer clear of such areas, I have heard that such facilities have "alien technology which can detect non physical intruders and trace them back to there body via the cord" ! now...I am not sure if that is true or not, but its a very high possibility that they shield them selves by some method either electronic or energetic or what ever.

of course you can always burn their computers via pyrokinesis, hmm, that would actually be stupid anyway

And some things are secret for a reason...
<br>
<br>
Besides, even if you were able to see something not meant for your eyes you probably wouldn't understand its context.
<br>
<br>
If you found technical data on a nuke at say, Los Alamos (since those tards seem to leave such stuff lying around) would you be able to decipher it or recreate it in any way? Perhaps, if you were a nuclear scientist who could AP you'd have a clue otherwise enjoy the Greek writings. It would be easier to get that info by posing as a Chinese spy anyway and buy it from a Clinton...

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Yes, I have thought about this but only in terms of wondering what on earth people find fascinating about American military installations, or any military installation for that matter.
<br>
<br>
Once you can access the areas of consciousness pertaining to the wider reality, all knowledge becomes open to you. Knowledge of life, how it all began, and complete knowledge of self. Having all this as a background to your thinking, you realise what petty nonsense, and what absolute tittle-tattle are concepts such as "Area 51" and "Spy Agencies". As if there were any secrets, lol. There are no secrets! They are just belief constructs that have been created by silly politicians playing their dumb power games.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I wasn't necessarily talking about proving it to people in general (ie John Q Public). I was talking about people who believe it's possible in the first place. In my mind, it would be necessary to provide some kind of proof that you have the abilities you speak of. Otherwise, anybody with a keyboard and an Internet connection could say whatever the hell they want.

Somehow I don't have the feeling that spying on the government would be as interesting as movies and books would suggest.

Why not spy on a corporation? Do you know what kind of sweeping world change would happen if the source code for Windows all of a sudden became public?

Hi Nostic,
<br>
Yes, I see your perception, and I agree with you.  I think just about anyone with a keyboard and Internet connection are already at it now.  There is a whole lot of disinformation on the Web, posted by every man and his dog (an aussie expression),  or the being they are listening to, or the great master so and so who says such and such, and, all the conspiracy theorists,etc.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing up my misperception.
<br>
<br>
Hi Telos,
<br>
Spying on the government would be a silly thing to do, as was my idea to recruit strong projectors to respond to the Mind-Controllers in a positive and up front way, on their own turf.
<br>
<br>
And yes, the Corporations are the power-mongers of this world..  so getting the low-down would be useful.  At the same time, all that info is available now ..  unfortunately you have to wade through all the sh+t to get to the solid stuff.

<section>
Interesting arguments you guys have brought up, anyone know a hacker? jk
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
(I do).
<br>
<br>
I suppsoe it is sensible to think that something to rival 'psychic invasion' so to speak, would be available to government institutions.  But on what basis could such technology exist?  I mean, how could it work?  Sure the CIA had the 'Remote Veiwing' program up until about a decade tomorrow.  They could have assumed that they were the only ones trainging so why bother to safe guard?  There's even a universtity for TRV now (Technical Remote Viewing), they have a site though I'm not too sure of the address.  Something like Psi-tech dot net or something, google it if you're interested.  But they're the only ones that call it TRV.
<br>
<br>
Corporations would be an interesting one but don't you think that half the world doesn't believe in this stuff so why would they bother safeguarding?  Think about it...  I've read research done by scientists on AP and they seem adament enough that you can't retain the state for too long for lack of energy so why should the instituations worry?  They really have no need to, I mean, who would be bold enough to try and what could one person say that could damage their work?
<br>
<br>
I'm nowhere near stong enough, hell, I can't even get the vibrations at the moment.
<br>
<br>
In fact, I wouldn't be too suprised that if this post keeps up and we keep typing keywords like 'CIA' 'Area 51' 'Illuminati' etc, that this chain of posts will end up being monitored.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know about the 'dictionaries?'  they're these massive computers in the US that go through all phonecalls, emails, Internet sites, looking for keywords and such to aid against terrorist attacks and the like (or that's what they want you to think -*Xfiles theme*- ).
<br>
<br>
I'm on a tangent.  I like consipracys.  If national ID comes along, microchipping, etc, who knows...  let the mind wander, literally.

Interesting topic. During my most recent AP, I commanded "Take me to Area 51!" I felt a rush, and suddenly I was in this corridor area. A UFO was sweeping the ground in some kind of contained environment (like going to a museum of some sort and looking in a large rectangular window to a man-made "environment") and I heard some kind of voice (narrator?) explaining this particular UFO "incident" didn't happen the way many believe it did.
<br>
<br>
I have no idea what particular incident this person was referring to, and my current conscious AP ability is novice, so I'm not even sure what was valid and what was RF. Hmm.
<br>
<br>
I would still like to consciously commune with spiritually attuned ETs, but right now, I'm like the guy with a Lamborghini in the garage (My ability to AP) with the keys (My Astral Body) but I don't know how to drive.

I think this leads nicely to the topic of Remote Viewing.
<br>
This is clearly a more controlled process of viewing Remote Locales.
<br>
<br>
I was discussing this here:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=17069&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As with OBE/Astral projection, I get the impression they aren't as perfectly controllabe as people think.
<br>
<br>
I still would like to know what kind of energy body/state induces Remote Viewing and how to do it successfully.
<br>
Going by what I've read, it does appear to work.
<br>
<br>
So Remote Viewing could be also a better or additional tool, for gathering iintelligence.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any info on Remote Viewing in context of being a certain type of  Astral Projection of some kind of energy body?
