<section>
Hello people, my name is Keith. There was a point in my life that I studied projecting, but, do to fear, I quit.  This was years ago.  Now that I understand a few things, I've decided to pursue it again.  I want to learn to project.
<br>
<br>
I can say I've projected at least one time.  But, I believe I do it often, unconsciously.  For the longest time, I was terrified of going to sleep.  I thought for sure I would die.  As I slept, I would feel myself vibrate, and I would feel like I was slipping out of my body.  I thought I was dying, and would have that jerk reaction, and wake up quickly, with a gasp.
<br>
<br>
This still happens.  Though now I understand, I may be projecting.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure looking forward to meeting and chatting with you all.
