Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
I'm new to the forum here.  A little about myself.  Well first of all I have 3 of the books by Mr. Bruce.  I'm very pleased with the highly comprehensive and extensive information found in them.  I had a couple of personal experience in the astral realm that strongly validates all that Mr. Bruce shares.  I'm thrilled to know there's so many people at this forum open to this wonderful realm and who aren't afraid to discover their "limitlessness!"
<br>
<br>
My primary passion and interest is in how we can better create our own reality on this physical plane.  I've studied a variety of information regarding this from psychotronic generators, Huna, shamanism, various religions, quantum physics, Silva method, chaos magick, new thought teachers, channeled materials, to more conventional psychological methods used in business and by athletes.  If you look for it, it's amazing what gems and treasures each unique perspective or piece of the puzzle can offer on how to better manifest your reality!
<br>
<br>
What helped me decide to post here and to make this request is after reading William Bulhman's Secret of the Soul.  It touches on various topics; however, what really grabbed my attention is when Mr. Bulhman discuss how we can use our experience in the astral realm to more efficiently and effectively create our reality on this physical plane!  Therefore I know there must be some highly empowered and adept individuals here at manifesting their heart's desire!
<br>
<br>
With that said, I would like to know if there's sub-forum here that primarily focuses on this topic (or perhaps in the future) and the interest level of the group regarding this topic.
<br>
<br>
Warmly,
<br>
<br>
Malachan

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I can understand where you are coming from as it is an area of study that interests me greatly. Not so much the mystical entanglements, but the pure aspect of how we create our reality.
<br>
<br>
If I could respectfully point out, when it comes to creating our reality, all of us are already highly empowered and adept at this. Every individual
<i>
 already
</i>
manifests the exact circumstances that she or he desires. Unfortunately, it does appear that people, in the main, have yet to realise that fact.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
