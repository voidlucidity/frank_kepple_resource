Frank, Guys &amp; gals,
<br>
<br>
I must be doing something wrong here, as I've been practicing pretty much every day, for the last two weeks here and still not making the transition to f2. I'm sure it must be something fairly simple, but what that something is...I'm not sure
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
I've just begun switching the 'run-down' to the method that Sarah talked about on her thread as mine was just too complicated it seems, so I'll carry on with the trampoline for the time being.
<br>
<br>
So I do a few breathing exercises(calming), bounce around on the trampoline for about 1/2 an hour, whilst listening to some music as my mental rundown, which I find, even at my approaching middle age is alot of fun and chewing a stick of gum, for the flavour effect.
<br>
<br>
Now here is where I seem to run right into my mental brick-wall. Should I be continuing to visualize the bouncing(and all that), when I'm trying the phasing for real, or should I be doing the noticing exercise instead?
<br>
<br>
Last night I tried the continuing the bouncing, just to see if I could step into the scene I'd made, needless to say I didn't. I find the generating a scene in a relaxed, kinda day-dreaming way, quite easy...Tho concentrating on something I want to step into, getting the image to stay in my minds eye is really hard. It just keeps dissapearing, have to pause for a moment and re-visualize again, only to have the thing wander off again
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
I don't know if it's relevant or not but as I was about to give up for the evening I got a series of really strong images and moving scenes, was really impressed with them, as the were so vivid. One was of me inside a train carriage, looking out at some mountain range. I'm not sure what it was, either the beginnings of a lucid dream, or maybe a f2 experience?
<br>
<br>
Yours, thoroughly exhausted...
<br>
<br>
Steve

The rundown will get you into F2oC, i think. The act of noticing gets you into Fz, the 3d blackness, and from there its ALOT easier to phase into the other areas of consciousness.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
One of the problems with making posts to a forum is replies tend to get fragmented and people start losing the thread of the process. This is why, I'm sure, people have been calling on me for a while to write a book, and why I too have wanted to: because it presents the whole approach in a seamless fashion.
<br>
<br>
Everyone is different, but we have events in common. Now, if you create a rundown of sufficient character for yourself you
<i>
 will
</i>
be able to step into it. But just because trampolining works for one doesn't mean to say it will work for another.
<br>
<br>
That's the big problem with the climbing the Rope idea that was first presented by Sylvan Muldoon reiterated later by Robert Bruce. As a mental rundown, it's a great idea and it happens to work well for some people. But ever so many people have reported problems with it. This is unfortunately what happens when you adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. So as I've said a number of times, you need to adopt a mental rundown that has all the qualities of engaging the senses, but not something so simple you get bored and not something so complex you lose the thread of it. Once you hit on it just right, that's when you'll step into it.
<br>
<br>
But having said that, you don't actually have to step into your rundown absolutely perfectly. We need to take a little step back here and ask ourselves why are we creating this rundown in the first place? Reason being we are wanting to help ourselves make "the switch" from Focus 1 to Focus 2 of consciousness. The mental rundown we create is simply to aid us in doing that. But the stepping into our mental rundown is not the end point of the exercise. It is merely an aid to the transition between Focus 1 and Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
After a while you should be able to find your internal "connection" I mentioned on another thread yesterday. Think of the rundown as using stabilisers on a bicycle or using some kind of buoyancy aid while learning to swim. The ultimate aim is to be able to ride or swim without the aids. Well, our ultimate aim is to be able to simply relax and look for that place in our minds and make the switch.
<br>
<br>
I would say you are actually making good progress considering you have only been practicing 2 weeks. You are already at the stage where you are making your connection with your wider self. You say you got some really strong images and moving scenes. Well, that's it, you are making that connection. I've said many times there is no real difference between a dream, a lucid dream, or a typical astral projection style of experience. All these events typically take place within Focus 2 of consciousness. All that changes is your perception and the expectations of your experience.
<br>
<br>
Again, what we are attempting to do in the creation of our rundown is to formulate a highly controlled lucid dream. Only a lucid dream where we are absolutely awake and alert at all stages in the process. If you catch yourself dreaming you will typically become lucid. Someone may ask then what is the difference between having a highly lucid dream and stepping into a mental rundown? And the answer is, essentially nothing.
<br>
<br>
The problem, however, is dreaming is a slightly different action that takes place within the same area of consciousness, Focus 2, but it is not exactly the same action. You will find that in the case of a lucid dream, you will have rather a lot of difficulty becoming conscious enough to the extent necessary to make a reliable switch to Focus 3. You will no doubt have a great experience. Revelling within your own mind, flying here and there. But typically coming awake within a dream is not the way forward. If it were, everyone would be doing it already as having a lucid dream is one of the most popular Focus 2 experiences.
<br>
<br>
You need to enter Focus 2 absolutely consciously for this to work reliably. So we create the mental rundown while being awake and alert within the physical but with the physical body totally relaxed and out of the picture. This is the Monroe MABA state or Focus 10. There is no direct correlation between the Monroe focus numbers and Focus 2 of the Phasing Model. This is one of the two main reasons why I changed to using the Phasing Model. Focus 2 of the Phasing Model I would describe as a wider Monroe Focus 12.
<br>
<br>
Once a person starts getting into this, they will realise that following the Monroe Model you more or less skip Focus 2 entirely. The Monroe focus 12 leads through focus 15 onto focus 21, which is the 3D Blackness stage. Here you are at the "junction" let's say between your own individual areas of mind (Focus 2 of the Phasing Model) and the Transition Area, which is Focus 3 of the Phasing Model or Monroe's focuses 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; 27. Or the equivalent of what Bruce Moen followers call The Afterlife area.
<br>
<br>
This does beg the question if our own goal is to switch to Focus 3 and the Monroe model leads more or less directly to Focus 3... then why not simply use the Monroe model?
<br>
<br>
You can, there is nothing stopping you.
<br>
<br>
However, as I've said a number of times, making that direct transition to Focus 3 is tricky. I always maintain that it is far easier for people to
<i>
 first
</i>
make the switch from Focus 1 to Focus 2 and then decide what they want to do. Energy work is far easier within Focus 2, for example, you only have to think about firing off some energy centre and it starts buzzing away merrily. Just this morning, for example, I was floating around in Focus 2 just firing off energy centres and having them buzz merrily away, while giving myself ideas about a section I am writing in my book.
<br>
<br>
As I was saying on a post yesterday, we access Focus 2 from the physical all the time. Our memory and our imagination is contained there. So anytime you remember something or imagine something you are accessing Focus 2 of consciousness. This is why it is the easiest transition to make. And we also make this transition upon sleep, of course, although sleep is again a different action in consciousness. But it is primarily an activity that involves Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Now, bearing all that in mind, you say that you were about to give up for the evening and you got a series of really strong images and moving scenes. One was of you inside a train carriage and looking out at some mountain range. Then you say you were not sure if this was the beginning of a lucid dream, or maybe a Focus 2 experience...
<br>
<br>
There is essentially no difference.
<br>
<br>
If you were still aware of being in the physical at the time of having these images then you were experiencing an F1/F2 overlay experience where you offer yourself an objective knowing of two different areas of consciousness at the same time. Typically, a person will be lying or sitting physical-body relaxed in the physical. They will still be aware of being in the physical to an extent, like, they haven't fully stepped into their mind, but they will be having some kind of visions in their mind. This is a typical F1/F? overlay experience where if you are seeing products of your own imagination it will be F1/F2. Or, typically, the people we call "mediums" will have an F1/F3 overlay experience, because these people (assuming they are genuine, of course) communicate to people in what is generally known as the Afterlife area.
<br>
<br>
This is what Bruce Moen teaches, for example. His Focused Attention method is essentially a method of teaching people how to have an F1/F3 overlay experience. But the way I do things is slightly different in that I teach you to actually step into F3 and have a walk around. This is a darned sight trickier but far more rewarding an experience, in my view. I'm not saying that to in any way denigrate Bruce Moen's work because his work is very genuine. He himself states quite categorically that the actual stepping into these areas is rather tricky, so he teaches people the easier option, if you like, which can be very rewarding. But there is nothing like
<i>
 fully
</i>
stepping into the area.
<br>
<br>
So because it's rather trickier, we have to take a slightly different approach. That's why we first practice stepping into Focus 2 and we don't consider anything else until we can step into Focus 2 and then transition to Fz. This is what we call our base state and the ability to project to Fz reliably is the first main milestone in the Phasing process. In your case, you may find that the creation of a mental rundown stimulates an F1/F2 overlay experience. So the next step is to let the experience ride, enjoy it, and then learn to step into it. Simply concentrate on it and imagine stepping into it.
<br>
<br>
This is again how having a basic map of the structure of consciousness helps in knowing what is happening to you. One of my goals in publishing the book is a person having read it will be able to have any experience, or combination of experiences, and they will be able to pick out exactly what is happening to them. In other words, even though they may not be able to fully control the experience (yet) at least they will know where they are at in their consciousness continuum. Which makes the whole thing a darned sight less confusing.
<br>
<br>
You question about how the Noticing exercise fits into the process I answered yesterday here:

<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I see now what I should be looking for, if I read your post correctly, the point to the rundown is in essence to find that point in your mind, where you can make the transition from?
<br>
<br>
I get alot of these flickers/moving scenes, just didn't understand what they were exactly, the fact that I'd discount them because they weren't the scene I'd constructed and was attempting to step into. I'll make a point of letting them run now, rather than getting cross with myself and dragging my awareness back to the rundown scene.
<br>
<br>
One happened the other night, again I'd all but stopped for the night and re-arranged myself to my normal sleeping position, was starting to drift off to sleep. For some reason I'd carried over the mental image with me as I'd found it interesting for some reason. I was beside a river/canal, found myself in conversation with some guy, by a lock. I wasn't "in" the scene, as such, kinda 1/2- 1/2, as things were moving around alot. But the thing that shocked me was I was talking to this guy about the lock and went to point some feature out and the usual mental/physical/f1 command to make my arm rise made my dream/f2 arm move instead. I found that rather funny
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again, it's given me some encouragement, at least I know I'm not so far off-tack

<section>
Steve:
<br>
<br>
Yeah, ultimately you are going through this process so you can develop/find/create that point in your mind that you can just relax and "look to" in order to make that transition. But that's a while away yet, I suspect. But don't let what I say stop you trying now and again. You see, people who are genuine "mediums" have that point in their mind already. But us guys who were born not so lucky, have to go through all this rigmarole in order to develop it. But it's a lot of fun and you can have quite a few good experiences while you are doing it. But I have reached the stage now where I can, more or less, find that place in mind.
<br>
<br>
The frustrating thing is that I cannot do it while entirely physical. I would love to be able to just look in mind and have a perfect F1 to F2/F3/F4 overlay experience. But realistically that's perhaps 5 years or more away for me.
<br>
<br>
One of the most popular "realisation" style of PM's and emails I get is from people saying, "Frank, I just read your post and it suddenly struck me about what you were saying and I get the same thing but I never knew what they were." That kind of thing. This I am finding is one of the big benefits of finally being able to offer people a "map" of the structure of the wider reality and the characteristics of the experiences you can have in the different areas. Because it allows people to catalogue their experiences and at least they know where they are in the general scheme of things.
<br>
<br>
Loads of times I've talked to people and they've just discounted something that's really important. So this is the main reason why I set out with the intention of trying to present people with a "map" they could understand. Having that they can at least know where they are in the wider scheme of things. They may not be able to fully control their experience, but at least they can recognise the various elements of what they are experiencing. Otherwise, you end up in a situation where you cannot control the experience and you simply don't know what's happening to you either. So it's all doubly confusing.
<br>
<br>
In your case it looks like your rundown leads you to an F1/F2 overlay experience. This is okay, it's one step removed from the front-line physical so it's a definite sign of progress. Once you detect this happening then let the overlay experience ride and try to step into the mental scene that way. So your route would be: F1&gt;F1/F2ov&gt;F2&gt;Fz&gt;F3. I know very well how much easier that was to type than it is to do. But you are making definite progress. A little more pushing in the right direction, coupled with a little patience, should see you at F2 before not too long.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

"Loads of times I?ve talked to people and they?ve just discounted something that?s really important."
<br>
<br>
#Lol, Yep I'm finding alot of snippets in the posts of yours and the other experienced phasers. Last week, again I was just having a bit of a play with the noticing exercise, found that at one point I had this silver/grey cloud descend from somewhere above me. Again I discounted it because it was not something I was actively looking for, only to find out in one of your posts that I wasn't very far off from whizzing off to the Fz..&lt;sigh&gt;
<br>
<br>
" You see, people who are genuine "mediums" have that point in their mind already. But us guys who were born not so lucky, have to go through all this rigmarole in order to develop it."
<br>
<br>
#It's interesting you say that as I remember reading somewhere that any significant skill that seems natural in a current 'incarnation'(If you want to call it that) has very probably been used in a former one, like playing the piano, or maybe sailing boats, etc,etc. So I begin to wonder if the difficulty of learning to phase/&lt;insert-new-skill&gt; is as a result of not having done this before?
<br>
&lt;Edited as it just didn't read right&gt;
<br>
<br>
Right then;
<br>
<br>
What I've been doing this w/e is listening to some music and picturing where I want to go in the 1/2 hour, or so before I try phasing properly and then will lie down and listen to a bi-neural type track on an mp3 player. I find that listening to this help in certain respects as it can be quite noisy during the w/e days, so cuts out all those disturbing noises.
<br>
So then I play a tympani type drum along to the beat, this I find is pretty engaging, start getting these images/moving scenes, tho not actually the scene I want to arrive in.
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
...Now I wanted to ask you about this "Stepping-into" the scene, as when I'm at this point when a scene presents itself, it feels like I'm either 'sliding' into it, or maybe 'merging-with' it?, rather than making an active stepping(without the body?), get a small sensation of lateral movement, or perhaps a sinking/woozy sensation you get when you're about to fall asleep or maybe lose consciousness.  Now what happens is my brain seems to balk at this as It's being told "Don't fall asleep!", so pulls me back from the sensation, so loses the picture/effect. So the next question is; Should I just let this sensation/effect go all the way?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for you patience

<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
Last night....
<br>
<br>
Went to bed a bit early, having been thinking about the whole situation and the rambling I'd made in my previous post, regarding falling asleep and WHY. Went through the run down as usual and was getting all these stupid images of big spiders trying to scare me. I kind of lost my temper with myself was saying to myself..."Oh very funny, I'm trying to learn this, you're throwing all this stupid stuff at me..So what are you going to do then, huh? Kill me?!" So I just picked one up and stuck it in my mouth..Ewww..Not very pleasant, but I think I got the point across and they all went away.
<br>
So got back to playing the drums, albeit a bit wobbly as usual, for some reason I got to thinking it was a bit lacking in character, so I started thinking about an old black Havana cat I used to be friends with, he appeared, was squeaking in that way Havana cats do.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I was doing all this, was only about 10-15 mins into my practice session was kinda rambling to myself(I seem to this alot) and all of a sudden my voice faded out and I found myself sitting on a train, was looking out the window, or rather I was looking 'at' the window in the carriage, could see all the reflections/refractions in the thick glass and the aluminum trimming around the window. I was there! At which point I started thinking to  myself.."Hey, hang on a minute!" and zzzzzzzzzzzp I was back in bed and the music was playing again. I suppose it lasted about 5-10 seconds, tried to get back to it but it seemed that was all I was going to get that evening.  Needless to say I started to jump round the room going "Yes! Yes! Yes!!"

Yeah, you're right I do seem to have a bit of a penchant for trains, but I don't know why? I go to work on a train, tho it doesn't look anything like the ones I've ridden on in my brief appearances in f2. They're more like the ones that VIA rail, or maybe SNCF use. I get all kinds of wacky images/ semi-arrivals, from materializing in a garden shed to standing ontop of some huge comms tower, a bit like the telecom tower in London. Maybe it's a part of my unique weirdness?

I'm still finding the visualizing where I want to arrive really hard, tho if I just stick to the noticing exercise I get the images/scenes relatively easy. I've not stopped trying to build one tho, it just seems at the moment that it just doesn't work for me

I must apologies to you all for my ramblings, I'm just trying really hard to find my feet in this, much bigger universe, is all.
