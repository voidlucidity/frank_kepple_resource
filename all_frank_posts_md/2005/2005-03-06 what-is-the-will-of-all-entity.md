<section>
Telos asked me about All-Entity's will, and I answered:
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 "All-Entity does not care one way or the other.  Our purpose is to experience the (long term) effect of our thoughts and actions."
</blockquote>
Needless to say, this subject is much too complex to be treated with a couple of short sentences.  In fact, I'm not sure whether I will be able to explain my opinion well enough to satisfy a wide audience.  Therefore, I'll start with a relatively short description and hope that comments and questions from forum members will help to clarify this subject.
<br>
<br>
I have coined the term "All-Entity" for the unified whole of the entire universe, and I mean by "unified" that there are no boundaries and separations between the parts at this highest level of reality.  We cannot visualize how physical objects such as stones, planets, solar systems, and galaxies cannot be separated from one another, but remember that our senses are very limited.  Our eyes see only a minuscule part of the entire electro-magnetic radiation spectrum.  So do our ears hear only a miniscule part of the acoustic spectrum.  And this is true for all our senses.  Furthermore, because our sense organs are constructed in three-dimensional matter, their sensing capability is limited to 3-D and consequently our mind tends to take it for granted that 3-D phenomena are all there is.  The only other dimension we are experiencing is that our world changes with time.
<br>
<br>
Because of an enlightening experience a long time ago, I am totally convinced that this is a misconception of actual reality.  The only reason why we believe that our 3-D + time world is the only "real" reality is because we don't experience anything else.  This is like people in ancient times believing that the Earth is flat because they have not experienced it otherwise.
<br>
<br>
I believe (without any doubt) that the real, Total Reality has untold more dimensions than our limited (3-D + time) perception.  We cannot perceive or even imagine the Total Reality because of our limitation, not because it does not exist.  Since this Total is the unity of all that exists, it includes also conscious life, because nobody doubts that conscious living beings exist.  Therefore I feel justified to call the unity of all that is "All-Entity".
<br>
<br>
Now we can try to understand why there are no separations and limitations in All-Entity, why everything is united in one single, homogeneous Whole, although things appear separated from our point of view.  Think of a flat table top.  Assume that it is populated with little bugs that are totally flat.  All they see of one another is their outside perimeter which appears as a single line, because their companions have no height.  For these creatures, a 3-dimensional environment is inconceivable.  They live and think only in 2-D, because this is all they experience.  If you touch the tabletop with all five fingers of your hand, the 2-D creatures would see only five separate "entities", because they cannot see the 3-D hand that connects them.
<br>
<br>
Our physicists have observed a similar situation in our world.  They have discovered some mysterious connection between subatomic events although they are so far separated in 3-D space that they shouldn't be able to influence one another.  The the scientists call this phenomenon "nonlocal".  However, if we assume that these events occur in more than three dimensions, they can be easily explained.
<br>
<br>
Coming back now to the "will of All-Entity", everything is intimately interconnected in this Whole of Everything.  It is the very characteristic of All-Entity that no divisions, no boundaries, and no separations exist at Its level.  Whatever occurs at our limited level of consciousness is automatically absorbed "at the top" because wholeness is the very essence there.  It does not matter for All-Entity whether we "screw up" in our limited world.  We are the ones who'll have to experience the consequences, because this is how the universe is organized.  Everything we do is o.k. with All-Entity.  Religions call this "unconditional Love".  However we better be careful what we do to one another, and to our environment, because we will reap what we sow.

<br>
It is refreshing to hear someone else state that there is no separation or limitations in consciousness and I agree with what you say, to a point. But where I start to get wary is your concept of the, "will of all entity". To me, that sounds like a traditional ultimate god concept only couched in more modern-day meta-physical terms.

Oh, I read your essay a couple of years ago and found it very interesting.

I think that you are right about that, but only to a certain point. If all entities being part of "All-Entity" would have single desire, it would be also desire of "All-Entity". I think that it could be desire to change, exist and evolve.
<br>
I also think that conception of "All-Entity" is frequently confused with "God" concept. I think that we are not a part of Jewish/Christian YHWH god, and this God is certainly not everything that exist. From what I find in Old and New Testament this entity lacks of "unconditional love" and has desire to control and punish and this is not the way "All-Entity" would behave. It would not punish itself.

<section>
JoWo:
<br>
I've seen your site, and your holon hypothesis is very impressive.
<br>
I'm of course not qualified to speak on the most difficult subject of what you call 'All entity', but I feel that although its a neutral enough word, endowing it with human emotions or even making an analogy of this sort is nothing but animism.
<br>
Honestly, all we know about it is that it exists, it is.... and nothing less nothing more. This we deduce from our own existence and the fact that we are capable of experience. We cant deny it.
<br>
We seem to know a few more things, like its infinite, without extent or time and multidimensional etc. But I don't know what it conveys when someone says that its multidimensional, except that some phenomena can only be described with expressions having higher degrees of freedom.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

</blockquote>
Its true that our sense organs are arrangements of matter. But matter (now we know through QT) is not 3-dimensional. In fact there is no such thing as 3D matter. The subatomic and 'force-particles' surely dwell in many dimensions.
<br>
Its also wrong to say that their sensing ability is limited to 3D. May be you know this and must have simplified things for readers, that we 'construct' the 3D world out of whatever impressions our senses register. Take for example - vision, the matter [mD] which reflects the photons [mD] which sensory cells [mD] detect and send EMFs [mD] to the brain [mD], produce a 2D image (not even 3D) in our mind. So its our minds which approximates the world to 3D, even though the information had mD components throughout.
<br>
Perhaps in our current state of evolution we can manage only this and live in an illusion of 3D world. Beings that are more evolved can experience more dimensions, perhaps, but it would be nothing more than a higher dimensional illusion to them.
<br>
<br>
It is true that our senses are responsive to a narrow range of signals. Ironically this makes them more useful. Imagine a radio tuned to all frequencies at once.... you hear only noise, because its being affected by everything and although it has a wide range, its useless. Now filter out all but one frequency on which a signal is being sent, we have useful information which we can hear easily. Senses are doing the same, by limiting themselves to a narrow range they ensure a good signal and meaningful info. This makes our survival possible.
<br>
<br>
When the pressures of survival are less (as while resting in a safe place), our mind can detune from this 3D illusion and is able to take impressions of a wider range, unfiltered through the senses and unprocessed by the survival-programs of the brain. Unfortunately being accustomed to this 3D illusion, we can't interpret them easily and don't see any meaning in them, so much so that we don't become 'aware' of them.
<br>
<br>
Spiritual evolutions consists of learning to take those unfiltered impressions, finding the meaning in them, being in close contact with the 'reality.'
<br>
<br>
Hopefully I was able to add a little bit to your very useful post

You are wrong about that. The signal that brain gets is surely stereoscopic 2d, but inside mind image is 3d.

<section>
Thank you, JoWo. That clarifies quite a bit.
<br>
<br>
I had the impression that the All-Entity had "top-down causality" over us.
<br>
<br>
I had this impression because of the fingers on the table analogy. I have top-down causality to my fingers, such that when I stick them into a 2D plane, a 2D quantum metaphysicist would then interpret them as part of one being. But in thise case, it's me - a being with top-down causality on those separate "entities."
<br>
<br>
If you do not want to give the impression of top-down causality, maybe you should nix the hand and fingers analogy? It's very similar to the notion of the "hand of God."

Hello CaCoDeMoN
<br>
<br>
Excellent point in your 12:48 post!  I picked the Topic Heading in response to a question from Telos about what All-Entity wants us to do.  My answer was that All-Entity does not care one way or the other.  And I did not mean that A-E does not care, because It is involved through us.  But It does not interfere with our free will.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for pointing out that A-E does have an agenda of its own, and since A-E and we are One, we have the same agenda: to experience life, which means a

I agree that nothing in our language is adequate to describe the nature of All-Entity.  Yet, we can't help but try it anyhow because, as beings with intelligence, we can't help but wonder about what is the basis of everything.  The only recourse we have is to communicate with metaphors, analogies, and imagery.  Even our best scientists use this approach.  Einstein imagined riding on a beam of light when he created his relativity theory.  I don't know which of my statements may have given you the impression of animism.  Whatever I wrote was sure not intended this way.
<br>
<br>
All-Entity is the very opposite if anything individual or personal because individuality or personality requires a comparison with other individuals or personalities.  However, All-Entity is all there is, with nothing to compare.  If I were asked to provide any description of All-Entity, I might call it a nonlocal field of multi-dimensional energy.  However, this is not correct either because it conjures up visions of space, which do not correspond to ultimate reality.  And the term "multi-dimensional" loses its meaning at the "top", referring to the discussion below.
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

Right, that's all it means to me.  Actually, it makes no sense to talk about dimensions at the level of All-Entity.  If we could perceive All-Entity directly, we would not discern any differentiations, not any lines of demarcation, etc., because all is one single, undifferentiated whole.  It is only because of our limited degree of perception that we don't see how everything is interconnected, and therefore we try to make sense of our environment by introducing different "dimensions", different ": degrees of freedom".  All-Entity is nothing but freedom, without differences or degrees, and the concept of dimensions is not appropriate any more.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps we could call All-Entity a singularity in the mathematical sense, where all our laws of physics collapse, as in the Big Bang.  As I understand higher reality, space and time do not exist there.  And, if time does not exist, everything that happened in the past and that will happen in the future co-exists in the great Here and Now.  This implies that the Big Bang is still happening.  Where else but in other "dimensions" where we don't have the degree of freedom to go?

I'll address the rest of your post later, Psan.

I am not certain of this. It is possible that "past" and "future" is only stored as a memories and probabilities and doesn't exist at all. Only the current moment would exist then. It would be similiar to a computer system without any input/output devices, time would not exist in such system too.

It is my perception that the basic function of our sense organs are understood via the classical view of matter. ( Correct me, please, if I'm wrong.)  I agree, of course, that in reality everything occurs in more dimensions than 3-D (plus time).  You are helping me to make this point, Psam

You can as well write 'misunderstood' or 'party understood' in above sentence and still be right.
<br>
It is now generally accepted that any measuring process (sensing is just another measuring process), is quantum mechanical in essence (i.e. cannot be fully described by classical methods)
<br>
And, I agree with CaCoDeMoN on the big-bang thing. Its not possible to assign the attribute of time to physical in terms of past, present and future as these are purely subjective aspects of what we perceive as 'time'.

It does, by giving us "Being" and life. But it does not force us how we live our life.  If you refer to my essay, pg. 31, You'll find a section titled "Causality".  It explains that there are two types of causality. The one used by science I called "temporal causation" because it occurs in time sequence.  The other is a top-down causation, which I called "holistic causation".  It can cause faster-than-light events.  Perhaps you want to look up this paragraph in my website.

<section>
JoWo, thank you again for your reply. Yes, when I read of "holistic causality" I had the impression that the All-Entiy holon was seemlessly causing me and other people to do things just as it super-luminally causes two particles to behave a certain way. And that, upon knowing this, the All-Entity would open the door for us to individually experience "holistic powers," if you will.

In the following paragraphs you say,

 We can say that happiness is a state of harmony within our self and with the world. The state of harmony exists in the whole of a holon (HP5). Therefore we want to identify with the whole that is immanent in us and that unites us with the world:

<br>
I was probably unknowingly adding context when I read that, but I was immediately thinking of Wayne Dyer when he talked about "the source" and how our only free will decision is whether or not to unite with the source (the source is, of course, that holistic something that unites all existence).

You are not Wayne Dyer and I am sorry for grouping you with him if you believe differently. You said that the All-Entity does not force us how to live our life, but do you believe, as Dyer says, that our only free will decision is whether or not to live in harmony with the All-Entity?

Whatever I read of Wayne Dyer was quite in line with my own understanding.  He is doing a great job to bring the new line of thinking to the masses. Yes, it is our decision whether or not to live in harmony with the All-Entity, and I think that it is our most crucial decision, but I wouldn't call it our only free will decision.

I completely agree with all things you guys said, but want to add some of
<br>
my thoughts (mixed with your thoughts
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
).
<br>
<br>
I believe that consciousness has no dimensions. So we can not say consciousness is 3D or something (BTW: Nobody here did say so), and it might be, that this very assumption is the key. Through consciousness we have access to everything. As JoWo pointed out any xD world can only be  fraction of realty and it will never be able to truly comprehend the universe within that xD system.

Consciousness on the contrary has no Dimensions, therefore it might actually be possible for us (consciousness) to perceive and understand the ultimate reality (like it is claimed in many Religions, Enlightenment etc.)
<br>
Consciousness and All-Entity are therefore the same thing in a way. Not seeing this is a delusion (maya), understanding it will remove all suffering (enlightenment)
<br>
If this is true, it will never be possible to describe consciousness and mind within a scientific system, there will never be a theory of everything. The only way to understand is to "see" . To see is difficult, though, since consciousness is usually focused within 3 D blocking it's view.

I don't know if this line of thinking is correct, but it makes a lot of sense to me
