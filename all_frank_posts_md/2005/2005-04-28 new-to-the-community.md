<section>
Hello all, I am new to this community, I thought I would use this as an opportunity to introduce myself and pose a few questions and experiences with you guys. I have browsed these forums for some time now, and everyone here seems to be nice.
<br>
<br>
A little bit about myself: My name is Vincent, I live in southern California. I will be turning 17 this June, and I would like to explain why I am here, and how I got here. First off, I would like to give a bit of background info. From my earliest childhood, I have been gifted with various forms of artistic ability as well as a keen sense of perception. At first this meant I could always draw from my imagination and see things for what they really were. I was always the guy who was constantly finding things. Whenever I would go out on a trip, or out on a walk I would more often than not come back with a small treasure of some sort. Over the years I began to take my gifts and absorb into my mind.
<br>
<br>
After a period of turbulence in my life, I almost completely retreated into my mind. Not that I was hiding from anything in the physical world, or substituting my life with some fantasy, I began to think about everything. I began trying to understand everything around me, and not that I accomplished my goal in totality, it nevertheless changed the way I see the world. I had become a knowledge-seeker, one to the degree where I became a sort of outcast of a young society who worries more about things like what to wear, and what's on TV, more than life itself.
<br>
<br>
My quest for knowledge soon became a quest for truth. My father is an amateur astronomer and radio operator, my grandfather was a pilot, as well as a number of other relatives. I too follow their interests and accomplishment. My fondness for science, space, and aviation has always been with me. Knowing that, it seemed natural for me to come across the topic of extraterrestrials and UFOs at least once in my life. Indeed this topic has come up in my life, after witnessing such phenomena first hand and listening to stories from family and friends, I began a deep and extensive investigation of the hole story.
<br>
<br>
My research took me all the way from deep and secret government agendas to the extraterrestrials themselves. Midway though my work I came upon the fantastic late night radio program, Coast to Coast A.M., with Art Bell and George Noory. This further encouraged my work on the matter and soon broadened my horizons to new topics. My finding in the extraterrestrial world ultimately poured into the both spiritual and metaphysical realms.
<br>
<br>
I had not been completely ignorant of the paranormal, I believed in ghosts, and spirits, I had always questioned the unknowns about life, and death. I've seen ghosts and apparitions in my own house: Mysterious people waling though hallways only to disappear, orbs appearing in holiday photos, transparent figures walking though walls, I had even been visited by a dead man when I was an infant. There was not doubt in my mind something was there.
<br>
<br>
This is where I find myself in present day. I am still searching, and still learning. I have been intrigued with the E.V.P. phenomena, and have herd countless accounts of paranormal experiences broadcast every night on Coast to Coast. This whole thing has captivated my mind these days. It was on Monday, April 25th when I was introduced to the world of Astral Projection. That night, Robert Bruce appeared as a guest on Coast to Coast. He made quite a captivating show with stories of his experiences and teachings, later the next day I stopped by the site he provided:
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.astraldynmaics.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.astraldynmaics.com
</a>
. From there I found these forums. And well, here I am now.
<br>
<br>
I hope to become a part of this fascinating community, more so, I would like to learn more about this fascinating subject.
<br>
By the way, I think I experienced my first "remembered" and involuntary astral projection last Thursday, but for the sake of making an already long story short, I will put it in another post.
