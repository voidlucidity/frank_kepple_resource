Thank you both Frank and Nick for the warm welcome!  I have not seen yet a forum for the mystical side of things such as shamanism, if I am in error perhaps you would not mind pointing me in the right direction?

Hi RedWolfHealgDrmr,
<br>
<br>
While we do not have a
<u>
 shaminism
</u>
forum per se, we do have a number of forums where the subject does occassionally appear. Try looking at our
<i>
 Welcome to General Metaphysics
</i>
and
<i>
 Welcome to Spiritual Development
</i>
forums for starters. Also, you may want to type the word
<b>
 shamanism
</b>
into our
<u>
 search engine
</u>
and see what comes up.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick
