I've had a few successful projections before, but only when I'm not trying.  A few days ago I woke up early and decided to try AP, I lay on my stomach, because that's the only position I've ever been able to project from.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I felt the vibrations and left my body and my room, but then it seemed way to dream-like to be a projection.  The next thing I knew, I was in this huge open metropolis, with people everywhere.  To the left was this roiling mass of darkness and lava, and to my right was this bright, beautiful city that closely resembled the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz.  I was looking for my boyfriend who just broke up with me the other day

and I actually found him with this Mexican woman on a train.  It was very strange.  I was floating and everyone else was walking and I kept intentionally scaring people by making ugly faces at them.  I did this to see if they could see me and every time I realized they could, I was surprised.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know what this was?  Any insight would help.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like you projected within Focus 2 of consciousness. This is the area in consciousness where most of us do our dreaming and astral projecting and so forth. Focus 2 projections are very "dream like" or can be very dream like as you are within the same area of consciousness where you would normally do your dreaming. In many cases the only basic differences between a dream or an astral projection are your level of awareness and expectations as regards the fulfillment of your experience. This latter element is a very strong guiding or determining factor within this area of consciousness. Perhaps more so than many people realise.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thank you, Frank.  I understand now.  I had another similar experience the other night, it was largely the same.  However this time, I was with my boyfriend and we were flying around together, talking about how funny everyone we saw was.  I'm not sure why they were so funny, but they were hilarious at the time.  But, it was the same place.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, he called me shortly after and told me about this crazy "dream" he had that we were flying around.  Does this happen often that two people can have the same experience while projecting?  I know he has no experience with projecting so he interpreted it simply as a dream.
<br>
<br>
On a side note, he apologized for breaking up with me and we are back together (Just in case anyone cares, which they probably don't).

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The best of luck with your relationship.
<br>
<br>
Within areas of subjective reality, we have areas of singular consensus and areas of common consensus reality. All these areas are part of your reality and no one area is any more or any less "real" than the other. Also, all these areas of our consciousness are heavily intertwined. We can also perceive several different areas all at the same time, where each "level" of experience is overlaid upon another. So you and your boyfriend can meet but each of you can be having a
<i>
 different
</i>
dream. Hence the typical question we get ever so many times from beginners, "Was this real or just a dream?"
<br>
<br>
Problem is, in the physical, if two people physically meet then they are at one place and each perceives their surroundings much the same. This does not have to be the case within the non-physical and is the source of much confusion. Typically, what happens is people are having some kind of dream then, in the midst of it, appears their old aunt Sally who passed over x-years ago. They exchange a few words and the person snaps out of it, reverts to full physical focus again wondering whether they were actually seeing old aunt Sally or whether they were "just" dreaming.
<br>
<br>
This is a typical overlay experience. The person is dreaming within Focus 2 of consciousness and then, due to some kind of trigger experience, begins to perceive Focus 3 of consciousness
<i>
 in addition
</i>
to their current dreamscape occurring within Focus 2. Within the non-physical, doing this is perfectly normal.
<br>
<br>
In your case, what it sounds like you may have done is transitioned from Focus 2 into Focus 3 of consciousness and met your boyfriend, who had unknowingly done the same. Focus 3 is an area of common consensus reality. This is an area in consciousness where people can objectively meet and it is very much like the physical in many basic respects especially in terms of being able to share the same, or at least a perceptually very similar experience. Your first post sounded like a typical Focus 2 experience but comparing it now to your second experience, it was more likely an F2/F3 overlay. It is often rather difficult to tell from a basic account and I usually err on the side of caution while explaining the basic background to people, in the hope they will be able to start recognising where they are at the time.
<br>
<br>
The second experience sounds like an F3/F2 overlay (I always put what I gauge to be the predominant area first). It would be interesting if you could get the actual details from your boyfriend's perspective and compare them to your own. If your respective experiences are in fact very similar, then you both could well have transitioned fully into Focus 3. In other words, you were not having an overlay experience at all, but a full Focus 3 experience. This I find very interesting, as it is precisely what I am trying to teach people to do.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thank you very much Frank.  I truly appreciate your insight.  Now I understand what happened much better.
<br>
<br>
I will try to get more details from him about his experience.
