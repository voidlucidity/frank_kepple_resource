Hi! Will we automatically remember who we are, this life and everything in it when we "die" and pass over to another dimension? I donÂ´t remember (wrong word if there is no time of course) or recognize any information from other dimensions or lifes. Maybe we find it if we look inside?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yes, you do, although I have no hands-on experience of that yet. :)
<br>
<br>
But from the many studies I have conducted within the area I call Primary Focus 3 of consciousness, it is apparent that you do in fact retain all memories and so forth of your physical life here.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
