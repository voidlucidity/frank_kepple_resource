I'm curious about something. I had an uncle who died in 1997. My question is if it's still possible to meet him in the "astral"? I have to learn how to phase first though and I'm wondering how long relatives stay in the "astral" before moving on, either to a new incarnation or to other worlds...
<br>
Thankful for any insights.
<br>

Stamboe and Shinobi,
<br>
<br>
I've had on occassion met up with past family relatives like my Grandma, Grandfather, Uncle and a good friend who past on.
<br>
<br>
Some of the experiences were quiet, not much said and the others were a conversation. There's deffinitely something to be said about this.
<br>
<br>
You can tell the difference and thy emotion behind it when you meet up with a deceased loved one..

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You need to shift your focus of awareness to the Transition Area in consciousness. This is Focus 3 of my Phasing Model of consciousness or focus states F23 to F27 inclusive of the Monroe model.
<br>
<br>
I've had direct experience of this many times and I can assure you it is perfectly possible. You might like to try checking out Bruce Moen's work (if you haven't done so already) as Bruce specialises in teaching people his Focused Attention approach that is specifically designed to contact people in what he calls the Afterlife. This is the same area in consciousness I am speaking of above. He has a course and conducts seminars in the USA and Europe and is highly recommended as Nick, our senior moderator, actually attended a seminar not too long ago (see the Sticky Post section for details).
<br>
<br>
The other way would be to study the work of Monroe. His two later books Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey gives clues but no real instruction unfortunately. Or we have a number of posts here from members interested in the Monroe approach that you can dig out using the search facility.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply and advice. I am friends with Major Tom and we go back along way. Back in the good ole days around 93 with Robert Bruce, irc, email digests when the internet Â was primitive.
<br>
<br>
I read monroe in the late 80's when I started projection and his methods were interesting but never really caught my attention to practice. I enjoyed reading theosophy and Castaneda and kinda of went that route for awhile. I do need to re-read monroe's methods to get caught up on speed, but as a refresh I just recently purchased Bruce's book - Astral Dynamics.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to many conversations with you in the future.
<br>
