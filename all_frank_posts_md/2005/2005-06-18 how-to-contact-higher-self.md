Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure whom you mean by your higher self. I guess you have been reading a few mystical books or websites and you are trying to find the solution to some problem or other.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi Frank
<br>
<br>
I am not sure how to say it ,but you know how when poeple talk about your higher self and reflect on the voice in your head when it helps you understand and make you m0re open to your own Intuition and some times thinking things that will eventually come true in the very near future,
<br>
That's what i mean by it.
<br>
Thank you.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
What you are trying to do, it sounds like, is get in tune with your inner or subjective senses. We have 5 objective and 9 subjective senses. Problem is the inner senses tend to become swamped by the signals hitting us from the outer or objective senses. So that is why to hear the signals from your inner senses most people have to quieten the outer senses to a high degree first. But as Lola also mentions, the more you listen to your inner senses the stronger the signals become.
<br>
<br>
I'm guessing a little here in what I am about to say. I do try reading all the mystical blurb to get a basic idea of where they are coming from. But I always get bored by the first 2 or 3 pages as it's all so trite in this day and age. I suppose it all made some kind of sense in the 1st century. But we are 2000 years on now. But I think that what mystics are calling "higher self", bearing in mind these people tend to objectify everything, is an objective representation of the accumulation of their inner senses they are viewing within Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Because people with these kinds of beliefs tend to be very "body" fixated, the objective representations they create tend to be an alternative representation of their own physical. Either a younger, perhaps more handsome version, or an older perhaps more wiser version, etc. All manner of varying representations abound it would appear. Some people even go so far as to create an angelic or god-like representation. Doing this is their prerogative, of course. But then what happens is they try to impose that experience on others by engaging the action of a leader/follower construct and so cults of all descriptions are formed.
<br>
<br>
The notion of "higher" self comes about due to a number of mystical belief constructs. But there is no "higher" or "lower" in consciousness. Consciousness just IS.
<br>
<br>
Notions such as high or low come about due to mystics imposing their beliefs of what they believe consciousness
<i>
 should
</i>
be. I mean, if someone is in the business of selling "past life readings" you need to get people believing in the notion that they have had "past" lives. If everyone were to realise that within subjective reality there is no time, so there can be no past or future, then anyone trying to sell a "past-life reading" would be a laughing stock. But there is nothing to the contrary you can prove in a court of law (yet) so the mystics get away with it. I call it Psychic Fraud.
<br>
<br>
If we were to entertain the concept of higher and lower for a moment whilst looking at our whole structure within consciousness, we would see that our physical manifestation is, in fact, our "highest" representation of self. Certainly in terms of complexity in its creation and application. But to the mystics, we are but lowly sheep needing direction and, surprise surprise, they are the ones who self-appoint themselves to provide it.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind if these people had something new to offer. But they just keep on churning out the same BS. Though many are getting clued up nowadays and we are seeing them putting a modern-day spin on all the old junk.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello you all
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your informative response..wow..I guess i have alot of things to consider.
<br>
<br>
One thing i do not comprehend is the number of focuses that have been lay ed out in front of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///me.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 me.As
</a>
Frank puts it"
<b>
 an objective representation of the accumulation of their inner senses they are viewing within Focus 2 of consciousness.
</b>
Would you be kind and explain this in more detailed text and/or lemme know where i can go and look it up&lt;i do not mind the research..you guys have been great providing detailed information and i would not want to take up a big chunk of your time, due to my lack of understanding&gt;
<br>
Thanx again
<br>
Peace out.

<section>
You don't have to believe in a Higher Self to benefit from talking to it. The benefit actually comes from the need to be more precise in communicating outside of yourself. The process of starting with a half-formed idea floating around in your head as a picture and forming it into words is very educational. It is even more effective to write it down on paper. Write a letter, imagining that you are addressing it to a specific person. You can pick a different person for each category you want to refine your ideas about. If I wanted to be clearer on what I know about phasing, for example, I might imagine that I am writing a letter to Frank. Don't send it when you are done. When you have it as clear as you can get it, set it aside for a while. After a week or two, a month, or however long you want to it can be very educational to re-read what you have written.

<br>
Thanks Frank I really like the way you put things, it makes me understand.
<br>
I don't see Mystisism as something completely stupid or bad (don't get me wrong) It just that usually it tends to make explanations based on strange interpretations. Like the whole "out" of body thing. I really like the way you explain that
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
That it is NOT!!! external Places and i feel it has helped me alot. And i really appreciate the work you are doing.
<br>
But i think many will read and not read at the same time because they feel alot of blame towards mysticism. I'm not saying you should not involve what mysticism is I'm simply saying that i feel alot of blame is towards it even if it is its fault i don't think it will make people much smarter.
<br>
<br>
As i said before

I will Buy that book as soon it is available Printed

You said that we have 9 subjective senses. Are you going to talk about them in your book?
<br>
<br>
I was also wondering are you going to have anything about the kundalini energy?

<br>
Hmm... that's been a few times now I've seen you comment on the beliefs of others as being BS, Frank.
<br>
I wonder what qualifies you to tell us what is and isn't BS?
<br>
<br>
You're personal experiences in the astral? Ok, they are your experiences, and that is what has formed the basis for your beliefs. That makes them no more or less valid though than the experiences of others who would say that they have experienced communication with their higher selves.
<br>
<br>
It comes down to the individual, and what resonates with them. Give advise yes, give suggestions, but as soon as you start criticising the beliefs of others as being BS, well, to me that starts crossing into religious territory, the old "my way's the right way" stuff.
<br>
<br>
you do have a great deal of experience when it comes to the astral. No one could ever doubt that. But just how much do you know about this world? How much contact have do you have with the spirits that are around us here in the physical world? There are a great many mystics, psychics, spiritualists, whatever you want to call us that have experienced many common spirit occurances completely independently of each other. It's only when we get together and compare notes that we realise we're dealing with the same beings in the same way, or more to the point, they're dealing with us in the same way.
<br>
<br>
I'm primarily a clairaudient, though I have at some level the full range of "claires". It's just my hearing is my strongest physical sense, so it stood to reason that it would be the one to become attuned to the spirit world first. It was some years ago that I first encountered the voice of another "being", passing information on to me, not only vocally, but via emotions, and intuition.
<br>
<br>
During my earlier christian days, of course I considered this to be the voice of God. Well, I was partly right. Once I completely ditched all vestiges of my christian belief system (read Robert Bruce's Catch Basket Concept - it's brilliant) the voice was still there. Ask simple questions and you get simple answers.  I asked "who are you?" I was answered "I'm you." After some more time of meditation and opening up both my senses and my mind to the options around me, I learned, through my own experiences that I was talking to my spirit self - my "higher" self. The part of me that exists outside of this physical incarnation.
<br>
<br>
Sahab,
<br>
It is a fair comment to call your spirit "higher" self, as this does indeed reflect the vibrational level you/it is working on. As to how best to communicate with it, firstly, stop listening to the world around you and start listening to your inner self - not your fast moving surface thoughts, but your deeper self, where your emotion and your intuition sits. Regular meditation is one of the best ways to get to this. It's in this quiet place that you will find your higher self. Don't go rushing to "hear" it though. Verbal communications is the least efficient way in which your spirit will communicate with you. Feelings, notions, hunches, intuituion - that's how your spirit will best get through to you what it wants you to know and where it wants you to go. After that, if you find you do have one of the mediumistic gifts working in your life, be open to what you might get that way.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

Hello James
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your down to earth Explanations.I am not here to object to Frank's point of view and as well as his experiences. for that .i would have to give him all the props for trying to clear misunderstanding about certain things...but ...did we not all of us start from step one&lt;being OBE or AP or whatever and however you started off to get to this point&gt;and realized ..hmmm...there is more to it than that?.
<br>
Well , this where i am..i am not gonna be able to take the first step and then...hooo ...look out...i am at step #50&lt;where i know more than i thought i did and have ever&gt;.and i can tell you that it is a fantasy.
<br>
Well..I thank you all for your kind and honest replies,specially frank, as he puts his ideas on the table plain and simple ,but for someone as novice as me in this field..it is a little raw to comprehend.
<br>
I do however .....understand What James is saying and right now&lt;in the state of learning to walk on a spiritual path&gt;i am capable to accept and learn from here on.Who knows..maybe a While from now...I will be Agreeing with Frank 150%.

Hi Sahab,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for you comments.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I guess what I was trying to say, even as tactlessly as I did it (with apologies to Frank), is there really are no solid rules when travelling your spiritual path. You find what works best for you. I just don't like to see other peoples beliefs or experiences put down as being BS. We all have our own different take on things.
<br>
<br>
Whatever advise you get, whatever books you read, see how it feels to you. If it feels right, feels like it makes sense or rings true for you, go with that. That's your intuition guiding you right there! Learn to trust these feelings, your "inner knowing". The more you trust and use it, the more it will serve you. Do this and you're already well under way in accessing your higher self.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James

Problem whit that is, something can feel so good, yet be so wrong. I have believed plenty of things, things I have now done away whit, but at the time they felt good for sure.

That's a good point Lente.
<br>
That happens a lot. Gods know it's happened enough times to me!
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
Two thoughts come to me about this -
<br>
<br>
We all do need to be discerning. There's a big difference between something that we
<i>
 think
</i>
is right, and something that at a deep soul level we
<i>
 know
</i>
is right. The latter is what will give you that feeling if something truly resonates with you or not.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes we will be led astray by our feelings, or we think we have been. Look back at some of the negative experiences, the wrong choices you may have made. Think about what positives came out of it and what you may have learned. I'm a great one for diving head first into something only to end up having it go all pear shaped. Then a month or so later, I look back and realise that I learned something really important from it, or its actually put me where I need to be for something much bigger and better to happen.
<br>
<br>
Our souls see the bigger picture that we don't. Opportunities can be brought to us in strange ways or through hard lessons.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.
