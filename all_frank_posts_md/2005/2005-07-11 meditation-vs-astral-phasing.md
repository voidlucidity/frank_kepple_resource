<section>
I have been busily reading posts, and just need to get something straight in my mind.  What is the difference between meditation and astral phasing (I hope I've used the right terminology)?
<br>
<br>
I here people mention they visit different places in the astral plain and can come across beings that they can communicate with, etc when astral phasing - but this all sounds like what you do in meditation to me.
<br>
<br>
Someone please explain!?

 Interestingly, most meditators will have experiences very reminiscent of descriptions of phasing here on this board, but are usually instructed to note them - while letting them go.

I agree with this.
<br>
It describes what I have experienced as "visions" during meditation, which not so coincidentally equate to experiences I've had while practicing phasing on its own.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I, personally, don't know the differences because, as I have said a number of times, I'm not exactly sure what meditation is.
<br>
<br>
I tried to find out once but the descriptions vary depending on the beliefs of whoever was putting forward the description. If anyone has any links to particular studies, I mean studies of an objective nature, then I'd be grateful. This is a topic I wish to cover in my book to help people who can already meditate, convert to the more modern-day Phasing ideology.
<br>
<br>
On one website, for example, one with a primarily Buddhist slant, they were talking about no less than 500 different types of meditation. I mean, that's just daft in my view. How can there seriously be 500 types? If each type took a person just 3 months to learn it would be 125 years before that person could form any conclusion as to which type was best for them. A highly impractical proposition. Anyhow, I gave up in the end.
<br>
<br>
I came to a kind of loose consensus about this and concluded that meditation is probably some kind of state similar to the Monroe focus 3 state. Only with a different balance of elements in the underlying action-equation in consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I note you use the term "astral" Phasing. In effect it would depend on what you are calling "astral".
<br>
<br>
Astral is a label with mystical origins and Phasing does not incorporate any "astral" belief constructs. The term Phasing was brought about originally by the author Robert Monroe who went on to found the Monroe Institute. I named my model the Phasing Model of consciousness in honour of his work.
<br>
<br>
Monroe was the world's foremost modern-day pioneer at this art, and his work dispels many of the old mystical notions and assumptions... including that of "astral". He he, "astral phasing" that would have Monroe turning in his grave that would. :)
<br>
<br>
Problem is, to the mystics anything non-physical is "astral". They haven't yet realised that consciousness is apportioned into 4 Primary Areas.
<br>
<br>
It is now coming to light that the
<i>
 very
</i>
early teachings from thousands of years ago would basically agree with the above. Plus, the more modern-day practitioners would agree also. It's just the mystics in the middle who remain at variance. But I guess even they might encompass this reality in a few hundred years or so. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Shinobi, very good description.  Meditation is just focusing on any thought or idea in general...which explains why there are so many forms.  Whatever your heart desires to learn, concentrate and focus on is meditation.  I would say you can very well incorperate phasing as a form of meditation.  It just has it's own unique structure...just like any other.

<section>
Thank you all for your insights.
<br>
<br>
I feel that you might be onto something Vvid, this was my feeling too.  It seems to me that there is little difference between phasing and meditation.  I just wondered if perhaps I was missing something, which had therefore given me the wrong impression.
<br>
<br>
I apologies, Frank, if I got the terminology slightly wrong.  I meant no disrespect.

Ha ha, no need to apologise. I was having a hearty chuckle at the thought of Monroe "turning in his grave" at the astral-phasing bit. :)

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I cannot accept that meditation is just focusing on any thought or idea in general. I focus on many, many thoughts and ideas in general throughout the course of my normal day. I'm not "meditating" I'm simply going about my ordinary business.
<br>
<br>
No offence intended, but there MUST surely be more to it than that. To my mind, it's that "more than" factor that I still haven't yet got to grips with. I've read many accounts of people saying what meditation means to them. But what I am searching for is a simple description of what meditation
<u>
 is[/i]. I need a authorititive description of the core action in consciousness in other words.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

<section>
I think I have a good  understanding of what meditation means, that is meditation in Buddhism. It took me about 5 years of practice to get it really. I do not know if I can describe it clearly in short words. i try:
<br>
<br>
Meditation is done to gain wisdom. The idea is that you gain insight into the nature of things by observing them closely enough.
<br>
Actually you simply observe the present moment mindfully in a passive manner.
<br>
The goal is to see the present moment as it is, so one tries to be as AWAKE as possible, you do NOT actively do anything with the things that appear in your mind, you just observe it, this is very difficult do do. You do not attach any concept to the things you observe. Because if you do anything at all with the sensations that appear in your mind you will miss the actual sensation and create something new. You want that your mind meets the sensation directly and powerful so it can reveal it's true nature. In order to do that you must be able to focus your mind on something at least in the beginning. But basically you can mediate the whole day while walking, talking, eating etc. it is just extremely difficult, therefore you train it by observing your breath.
<br>
<br>
You want to be like a mirror, everything just reflects in your mind but as a mirror you do not do anything with the "images" that appear within you. usually the mind attaches labels to things you want to stop that in  meditation. stop it. focus the mind to one object and observe it mindfully.
<br>
<br>
That's is how I would try to describe mediation in short words. Don't know if that  makes sense to anybody else then myself.
<br>
<br>
Frank: I think to truly understand what meditation is one needs to do it

For anybody really interested: I have read dozens of books on meditation. By far the most  comprehensibly is "mindfulness in plain english". it is fairly short and very clearly writen. You can take a look inside at Amazon and read Chapter 3 "what meditation is" it starts on page 29. Every body wanting to know what meditation is should take 5 minutes and read thru chaper 3 then he'll have an idea. To do that just scroll an the book then type in 29 into the search form that will take you to page 29 at page 31 you won't be able to read further. simply open up the link again and this time search for 31 to go to page directly. This way you can read the whole chapter.

You must also keep in mind...that you must keep a clear mind.  Free of any tension, anger, excitedness, and so on.
<br>
<br>
You can meditate while you walk, but there are simply too many distractions.  For instance, where you are walking, what is going on around you, what you have to pick up at the store...This makes it easy to go off on random tangents.
<br>
<br>
In my opinion you must meditate in order to phase as they actually go hand-in-hand.  You must clear you mind and concentrate on whatever you are focusing on.

I just thought of an interesting story...if anyone has heard this feel free to elaborate.
<br>
<br>
A large group of frequent meditators got together in a city with a high criminal rate, and meditated in a group effort to reduce the crime rate by something around 25% within a year or so.  And it turns out that it actually happened.  Once again, I forget ALL of the details.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I guess you can take this story into account of an idea of what meditation could be used for.

It's one of those words that means different things to different people.
<br>
<br>
When I meditate, I sit/lie quietly and focus my mind.
<br>
<br>
That's it.  Nothing else.  As simple as that.
<br>
<br>
What I focus my mind on is whatever I want to at that particular meditation session.
<br>
<br>
So, in "my" terminology, when I'm practicing phasing and jumping on my trampoline, I am meditating.
<br>
And when I'm sending people gifts from nature, I'm meditating.
<br>
And when I'm trying to work out a mental "problem", I'm meditating.
<br>
<br>
Actually, I've just looked it up in the Oxford dictionary, for what it's worth, and the first meaning is quite nice:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "Engage in contemplation."
</b>
<br>
<br>
How uncomplicated is that?

<section>
Meditation has traditionally been passed down to people through lineage and generations of teachers and students.  Think of all the different groups of forms that have developed in the East and West, with all their different energy paths and systems.
<br>
<br>
I can't explain the two words in comparison to each other because that wouldn't make sense, but if you seek knowledge then it makes sense to start from a place where knowledge has already been gathered.
<br>
<br>
I guess this question is like asking, how do you relax?  Well, any progress begins with the first step.
