I have experienced what I think are pre OBE vibrations some time ago. I havent felt them since and I have been unable to recreate them. So.. What im asking is...
<br>
<br>
If I wait long enough through meditation, will these vibrations just recreate themselves?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as pre-obe vibrations. There are a number of bodily phenomena that can give vibrational-type states. It has been, in the past, that people may have experienced a vibrational state and subsequently "exited" their physical body. But this is by no means necessary. Times move on, technology changes. This work is no different. Unfortunately, in this we are a bit behind the times, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
If you wait long enough then a bus may well turn up. But you could just as well set off walking and get there just as quick. In other words, look to your own guidance and not to some outdated mystical stuff that may well be just nonsense dressed up as a legitimate technique.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for the reply, How should I go about exiting in the first place then?
<br>
<br>
I guess I was hoping that the vibrations meant it was time to project.
<br>
And it would have been nice to have some point where I can consciously decide that, now, this is when I can make my double leave my body and go out, this point here.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise is OBE just something that happens naturally in a deep trance?
<br>
There is no real instruction to do it?
<br>
Because if its just a matter of deep relaxation with an alert mind , is the term 'mind awake body asleep'? If that's all there is too it I might just practice being able to go into that state as much as I possibly can.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I have experienced the vibrations during the night and have had many successful OBE's doing so. Some people do experience the vibrations before making there exit out of the body. But everybody is different. If you experienced the vibrations during meditation that is great. But there are quite a few pre-obe symptoms. It is best to be objective and not look for anything but just let the experience happen. The fact that you felt the vibrations during meditation could be an indication that you are indeed achieving the ideal relaxed state. If they do come again during meditation use your mind to increase the intensity of the vibes and just get up and walk away from your physical body. I only share this with you in case you do get the vibes again during meditation. Also bear in mind that this worked for me and does not necessarily mean that you will automatically have the same results as I. A lot of factors can prevent successful OBE attempts. Fear being one of them. Good luck.[/quote][/i]

<section>
So, when have you Â experienced vibrations? Have you done any energy body work?
<br>
<br>
Do you try to set yourself in a certain mind set?
<br>
<br>
I have been trying to project but haven't had any success, I have been thinking that I should try mastering a trance state and moving from there but it is difficult for me to
<br>
achieve the trance state, which is quite the bother.

I read William Bulhman's book on AP. He had some pretty useful information in regards to the vibrations. The key is waking up but not moving your physical body in the process. You then search your body for any tingly or odd feelings along the length of your spine up to the nape of your neck. The idea is to hone in on that feeling and intensify it using your will or desire to do so. Then once the vibrations began and reach a certain intensity you can make your separation attempt. Sitting up works great for me. I have had many successful OBE's using this method alone. I don't do any energy work however. And I do meditate from time to time. In regards to one's mindset I would say that I don't have one. All I do is remain relaxed and objective(maybe that is considered a mindset

). Bear in mind though that everyone is different and might not get the same results as myself using this method. Stay on course with your meditation Star. Maybe an OBE is right around the corner. Good luck

I dont think you will get too much out of waiting for an oobe to occur. Taking an involved approach makes more sense. Some people dont need to involve themselves all that much in the process. If feeling for vibrations upon going to sleep lead to an oobe then you have found a useful way to recognize pending dream activity.

what does using the vibes as a sign of dream activity have to do with mysticism?

Frank, I have no doubt you know a lot about OBE's but I think you shouldn't speak in absolutes on a topic as vast as this.
