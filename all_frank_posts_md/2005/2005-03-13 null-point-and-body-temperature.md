Okay, this may be a bit long so sit tight.
<br>
<br>
I ran into a couple of things and need some clarification.  I recall from reading something that there's a certain part to focus states that includes something called 'nullpoint', somewhere between F12 and F21.  I seemed to have encountered this twice in a 24 hr period while attempting F-states and AP.  I was drifting and had some annoying song repeating in my head and  I just 'snapped back' to term it, and kind of felt
<i>
 inbetween
</i>
something though I had been drifting in and out of F12 for about ten minuets that night when I encounted the null as it where.  I never got to F21 from it but something else occurred.
<br>
<br>
I remember the first time I had the vibes, first two times actually, how they weren't exactly gentle but I believe I came across them by developing a 'ho hum' attitude as it's been deemed.  They weren't giving my any discomfort but I remember the sound of a chainsaw starting up outside my window (in the middle of the night, I think not, auditory hallucinations)
<br>
<br>
I also recall a partial seperation of my head but I wasn't able to disengage from the physical apart from that, no matter how I willed.  I recall an increase in pulse and a rising and falling sensation and other oddities in sound such as high pitched sqeaks.
<br>
<br>
I used a visualisation I've developed, counting down from ten to one to get me to  F10 and then I basically switch to auto from there from the act of 'noticing'.  I was happy with whatever happened but another thing happens that annoys me on a regular basis.
<br>
<br>
My body temperature will suddenly rise quite fast whenever I'm actually "getting somewhere" and I'll overheat wherever I am.  I try to wait it out, hoping it will go back to normal but I end up cutting whatever I'm doing short only to find that when I get up, I'm fine.
<br>
<br>
Any ideas?  Also, a clarification on this 'null point' thingie, please?
<br>
<br>
I also got slight vibes that morning, plus the null again but was able to pull nothing from it.
<br>
<br>
Any suggestions or thoughts ont this.  Also, maybe anything I may be doing wrong or right for that matter?  I'm basically asking for a troubleshoot for future attempts.  Anyone game?

Andali:
<br>
<br>
I haven't got much more to add on the "null point" thing that the Major hasn't mentioned. When I go through the Monroe focus-level construct I always seem to come across a kind of null in my awareness inbetween F12 and F21. It's like I blank out for an instant.
<br>
<br>
I always thought that must be F15. There was a time when my idea was to slow the process down and investigate this, but then I went on to using a different "method" based on the 4-focus model that came into my awareness following my frustrations in trying to go "beyond" F27.
<br>
<br>
From aligning myself with this new construct I came across Focus 4 of consciousness, and since then that is all I've been concentrating on, more or less. Once you can Phase to Focus 4oC you won't want to go anywhere else, lol. It's whacky and wild and a whole lotta fun!
<br>
<br>
I reckon the getting hot thing is just nervousness or slight fears coming into play. Thing is, when you project in the traditional sense, i.e. vibrations and "separating" from the body, you tend to hear all manner of sounds. I used to get loud knocks, like someone banging on the front door. I forget the number of times I actually got up and went to the door convinced that this time there really was a knock at the door. But no.
<br>
<br>
Sorry I cannot be of much help than that. It's just that much of what you say is just typical of what can happen. Like where you say you heard a chainsaw starting up, yeah I can well believe it.
<br>
<br>
I used to get a sound like a jet place flying low overhead. For ages that would bug me. If it weren't a jet plane it would be a helicopter, lol. Then once I went through a phase of hearing these ghastly screams, they were really freaky. Then there was the time when I'd hear random shouts, like, someone would shout my name, just from nowhere. Or they'd shout HELLO! And it would sound like there was somone right beside me in the room I was in. It would shock me out of it and I'd fully expect there would be some kind of intruder in my bedroom. But no, it would all be normal.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I've heard the things that talk to me as I try to fall to sleep. They are really bloody odd, and they sound so real. I used to make them have conversations with each other if I was really bored.
<br>
<br>
I remember when I was younger, that if I was in the quiet and didn't move around much for a while (over 20 minutes which didn't happen much with me having brothers), I'd be able to clearly hear music that I could play in my head and I'd be awake and sitting in a seat, and just staring ahead. It'd break off if I moved, I think. I forgot about that happening, nice to remember it again.

I guess about here I should point out that when I tried in that morning, I hadn't actually been trying.
<br>
<br>
It seems to be a repeating problem  I encounter,  I end up with something when I have absolutly no intention.  Like this morning, a day off school ment that I could sleep in but sleeping in decided to include itseld in about two spontaneous RTZ projections where I hardly could move at all.  That and the fact whenever I have an intention to get to F21, I end up at a light F12 and no further.  Then I overheat and have to get up.  Come to think of it, I never used to overheat until recently, hmmm.
<br>
<br>
That and the fact all RTZs are happening with reality fluctuations, minimal movement and me just sitting up realising that I'm not really getting up but have in fact 'popped out' so to speak.
<br>
<br>
Frank, this 4focus model you talk about, I've heard it mentioned a fair bit but have never actually caught on to what it is, can you please explain it further?

<br>
See, people tell me these things and then I wind up with experience on top of experience, and though that's not a bad thing and I'm glad I'm actuallly getting somewhere, it tends to frustrate me that my original intention is just cancelled out and I end up with something else.  I've had no intention to get to the RTZ and keep ending up there.  The thing I'm actually trying to do is get to  F21 so I can float aroun in the 3D blackess and listen to a 'piece of music' (good idea Frank, I've been looking through my CD collection for something worthy of it when I do it).
<br>
<br>
The sounds aren't so much a bother as other things but at the moment, the vibes are coming about as a paralysis episode and when I go to move, I find I can which is rather strange, but the feeling is still there and that brings on something else.
<br>
<br>
Gee I type too much.
<br>
<br>
I guess my basic problem is keeping on track and unintentionally having other things happen.

Besides that mentioned above the only information I have found is from the Gateway Manual:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">

 Prospecting #3: Null Point - This exercise can lead you to a rich and lasting gold vein in the mine of your mind. This vein was unearthed in our laboratory while working with test subjects. Our laboratory, instruments suggest that the Null Point is where the body?s electric polarity shifts into a neutral phase. Our subjects have found that the Null Point provides a useful "window" for heading in any direction of mind activity. At the Null Point, you may purposefully decide exactly what to explore. To reach this state of pure potential, after completing the preparatory process, go to Focus 10, then to Focus 12. Then the Hemi-Sync signals can guide you beyond Focus 12 to the Null Point.
 <br>
 <br>
 Prospecting #4: Plus Polarity - Strike it rich! The purpose of this exercise is to lead you through the Null Point to the opposite polarity from where you started. Various studies indicate there is reason to believe that the body's polarity routinely shifts from positive to negative and back again in cycles. Our research suggests that a deliberate shift in polarity indicates that one is experiencing a change in consciousness. We have observed that such a shift indicates a substantial change from C-1 awareness to nonphysical awareness. Go from the preparatory process to Focus 10, then to Focus 12. Allow the frequencies to assist your shift in polarity. Pay attention to subtle changes in your awareness. Notice if you recognize more aspects of nonphysical energy. As with all the tapes in this home-study course, the Hemi-Sync signals will bring you back to your starting point.
 <br>
 <br>
 Prospecting #5: Near Reaches - Stake your personal claim in the physical universe. Complete the preparatory process and go on to Focus 12. Passing through the Null Point in this exercise can lead, you to discover untold treasures in and of time and space.
 <br>
 <br>
 Prospecting #6: Far Reaches - What's farther than the vast reaches of the physical universe? The infinite nonphysical energy systems that go beyond time and space. From the preparatory process, Focus 10, and Focus 12, pass through the Null Point and begin your hunt. Dig deep. Soar high. You?re now beyond words. All that you have learned through your Gateway Experience has prepared you for your journeys.

<br>
In a previous thread I have played with the idea what if the spontaneous 180 degree body rotation (on the axis perpendicular the body lenght axis) mentioned by many is symbolizes the flip around this mysterious "null point." If this so, the "null point" is somewhere between F12 &amp; F15.

These focus things, are they actual Astral projection or are they something else?

Andali:
<br>
<br>
Apologies for the delay in replying, but I'm really busy at the moment so my attendance on the forum will be a bit sporadic for the next five or six weeks.
<br>
<br>
Don't worry, what you are coming across is what ACTUALLY happens. The big problem is, most people who write about this kind of thing are merely "reporters" writing about possible events. You see, you read all the websites and it all sounds really straightforward. But the fact is, everyone just tends to parrot everyone else, and hardly anyone can actually DO any of it!
<br>
<br>
Okay, maybe they've had a few lucid dreams, or they smoked some whacky-baccy, or whatever. But when you actually try to go "beyond" all the messing about, that's where the experiences start to get really confusing... but really interesting at the same time.
<br>
<br>
It's essentially the difference between having a few whacky experiences, and becoming a serious practicioner of the Art.
<br>
<br>
When you Phase into a wider sense of awareness, you tend to receive overlayed impressions of several different areas of consciousness at once. The challenge, therefore, is not so much a question of, "How can I Phase to a particular area?" The core challenge tends to be, "How can I filter the information I am receiving in order to perceive only one area of consciousness at a time?"
<br>
<br>
This is why I am trying to get across to people that the Focus areas of consciousness I am talking about (i.e. Focus 1 to 4), are not places where you go to: THEY ARE FOCUSES OF ATTENTION.
<br>
<br>
What people fail to realise is we ALREADY occupy all of consciousness. So there is no need for us to "go" anywhere to be experiencing any "thing" within a different area. In Truth, there are no "different" areas. Consciousness just is. The only "separation" that exists is that which we place on ourselves for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
Once you genuinely attempt to go beyond the restrictive and highly "filtered" one-world-view... everything tends to start happening all at once. It's very confusing because you have this layer, superimposed on that layer, and at the same time this and that is happening, and all the while that's going on, there is something else layered upon something else in the background. He he, that's the difference between objectively focused Linear Time and subjectively focused Simultaneous Time.
<br>
<br>
But that's how it is, in
<u>
 reality
</u>
. Not the wishy-washy "new age" touchy-feely view: where we all suck crystals for breakfast and go to work in our manure-powered cars. What you are experiencing is the actual, down-to-earth nitty-gritty of the wider reality... in a
<u>
 true
</u>
sense.
<br>
<br>
Think of it this way:
<br>
<br>
You ALREADY are bombarded with every input from every reality that ever was. But, for the purposes of experiencing this particular physical reality, in this particular time-frame (out of the infinite numbers that are available to you) you apply a specific kind of "filter" that allows you to experience it. That one filter that you are currently applying is what, in Phasing terms, is called a, "focus of attention".
<br>
<br>
Once you widen the scope of that filter, the more of the wider reality that becomes open to you. Which is great. That's what you are trying to do. But don't be confused by it all, when it all starts becoming open. Simply accept it and mentally "home in" on the areas you wish to experience. In other words, focus your attention on the part that interests you. Again, that's why I say, these areas are NOT PLACES... they are
<u>
 focuses of attention
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
In a way, I think you are expecting them to be a place where you travel to, and all you see are the artifacts that pertain to that place. No, it's something you select from a myriad of areas.
<br>
<br>
You see, the Phasing model I purport is very different from the Monroe "linear focus" model. With the Phasing model, you tend to end up in a place where you feel like you are, "in the midst of everything". Like you are at a centre in the midst of all possible conditions (which you are!). Now, from that place you select the area you wish to focus your attention upon.
<br>
<br>
At first, when you experience this, it
<u>
 does
</u>
feel like you are in the midst of total confusion! But if you work at it, like I did, you will realise that there are, in fact, four primary focuses of attention you can point towards. One of them is the physical, of course, and there are three others that are non-physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Frank, your attendance on the forum will be a bit sporadic for the next five or six weeks? That's too bad... You're such a good teacher!!! Even if you don't know, there are so many peoples reading your articles...!!!
<br>
I have had so many valuable lessons to take from your posts!!!
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are so right: "... hardly anyone can actually DO any of it! "
<br>
But can you really teach everyone how 'to becoming a serious practitioner of the Art'?
<br>
If so, so many people will need your help, as I need it my self...
<br>
<br>
See you,
