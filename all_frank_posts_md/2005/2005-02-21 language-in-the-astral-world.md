IF you're talking to an entity in the astral plane, why would the respond to you in English.  Shouldn't they have their own language?  Especially the ones with weird names.

Has anyone proven this though, until it is proven, people's encounters with entities could be just a pure fabrication of the mind.

Language? Notwithstanding the fact that I have met dream characters who spoke to me in different languages, I will say that there are other forms of language than speech. There is body language, the language of emotion, art and music... these languages may very abstract, but what language isn't?

Not to discourage you, and not to downplay other members of this forum, but I should warn you that these conversations tend to lead in universal directions... like, "how do you know reality isn't just a fabrication of your mind?" Such talk can be confusing, because reality and fabrication are a contradiction in terms.
<br>
<br>
It's like picking mathematical operators and saying, "how do you know (+) isn't actually (-)?"

I have no hesitation in confirming for you that people's encounters with entities (as you call them) are pure fabrications of the mind.

Frank, is that because we purely fabricate

 all

reality?

Thanks telos, you have proven that there are entity's that speak other languages.  It's proof that these entities are real in a sense.  Anyways, I don't think telepathy can be decoded and encoded into language because there are too many synonyms in one language.

I suppose they are real in the sense that I created or produced them for the purpose of my experience. Creative production is more simply known as fabrication, especially as an assembly of diverse parts (appearance, personality, visage, language, etc.). So, you're right, because they are fabrications they are real.

Telos:

I was just looking in my Collins, and the primary meaning of fabricate is to: make, build or construct. So, yes, my initial statement runs true though I can see where Major Tom is coming from in his suggestion of alternative terms. Due allowance was given to me by the original poster's use of the word "mind" as opposed to the more commonly used term, brain. So that let me have a little play, lol.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of communication and language, what you should try is releasing a word within Focus-2 of consciousness and examine the word
<i>
 as a concept
</i>
. It's kinda funny, I always crack up at the word "because". I don't know why, but the word,
<i>
 as a concept
</i>
, holds a resonance that particularly tickles me.

<section>
Perhaps try asking a few enties to actually communicate in thier own language, get back write it down and have someone else try to converse w/ that same entity and compare results afterward?

Actually I think they could be real, not just a fabrication.    The only way to find out would be befriending one i guess.  Then tell someone else to meet them.  Someone should try that.

<section>
Come to think of it, I am not sure there are ANY two entities that speak the exact same language, though we often think that we do.
<br>
<br>
It's a curious fact then that people who do not speak the same language at all  have the fewest instances of miscommunication:  They do not make the mistake of assuming that they understand each other at any level.
