Does anyone know? I'm not sure if it's clockwise or counterwise, or what the effects of doing so are.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
In nature, creative energies tend to spin clockwise as we would call it.
<br>
<br>
These energy centres are whorls of energetic movement, they are not fixed in stone. But you can imagine them as a kind of sphere in the approximate locations you see typically presented. They spin clockwise and are oriented such that they spin along the axis of the spine.
<br>
<br>
The further "up" you go the faster they spin. It starts at the root (red) and you could think of this red centre spinning at about 10 or 12 times a second. Then add that factor for each one going up. The strongest vibrational colour is, therefore, Purple. This energy centre has a strong directing influence on all the others.
<br>
<br>
They are translated as different colours, as colour has different vibrational qualities that are affecting, in terms of energy, in different ways. Colour is a Truth. Meaning, there is a representation of colour within all dimensions. Energy has specific qualities that objectively translate in particular ways, and one of those ways in which we objectively view these particular differences or translations is in terms of colour.
<br>
<br>
Each energy centre is affecting of various functions of the body. But this is to be thought of, again, as not absolutely fixed in stone. Because all the energy centres are affecting of each other to varying degrees. They are NOT acting in isolation, in the sense of each energy centre doing their particular bit (as I have seen many websites trying to make out). They are all influencing of each other and all work in combination. But there is a particular accent placed on each centre to the extent where a particular energy centre could be said to be more influencing of certain factors over another.
<br>
<br>
In the instance of "healing" oneself, for example, which is what I suspect you are thinking of, then the energy centre that is the most affecting is the 4th one up, which is the green or the heart centre as it is often called.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

It's blue now? I've read of it being green, but never blue. Where did you get your information on the colour of chakras?

Ha ha ha, yes, you are quite correct, my mistake, which I just corrected. It is green and cannot for the life of me think why I said blue. :)

<section>
In my experience with chakras, they don't all spin the same way.  They seem to vary from chakra to chakra and person to person.  I always rely on my intuition to tell me which way each one is spinning.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone else found this to be true?

<section>
I too have found differences in the directions.
<br>
I wasn't going to say anything here because Frank's information does actually agree with what many "energy" practitioners have found, including my Reiki master.
<br>
<br>
Though this info presented does fit probably a very large percentage of people, I have found my own chakras to operate differently. Mine work in a kind of meshing gear arrangement - one clockwise, the next anti-clockwise and so on. I have also read that those of us in the southern hemisphere will experience different directions of rotation to people in the northern hemisphere, due to the observed spin of the earths magnetic field south of the equator, but I haven't yet had anyone prove or disprove this enough to hold it as true.
<br>
<br>
One very good way to find out what your chakras are doing is to dowse them using a crystal pendulum. The crystal will pick up the movement of a chakra's energy field and will spin accordingly.
<br>
<br>
As Frank mentioned about the functions of the energy centres, nothing is written in stone. There are some basic guidelines, and there are some known consistencies - such as the colours, but like out physical bodies, our energy bodies are as individual as we are.
<br>
<br>
The best way to know if there's ever a problem is to first find out what is normal. When you can feel through your intuition that everything is operating properly, and remember that our bodies never lie to us, make a map of how your energy centres normally work. Then you can refer back to that later.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yes, agreed on the general points.
<br>
<br>
With this kind of thing it's often difficult to offer a beginner clear guidlines while allowing for the fact that there are no hard and fast rules, and to do that within the space of a post to a thread.
<br>
<br>
When I was first investigating this area of study I never visualised my energy centres "spinning" at all as I found it a little tiresome and distracting. I found that when I simply visualised a coloured sphere in the approximate area this was *way* more effective for me.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, this is quite a complex area of study and the experienced people here could no doubt all write pages and pages just on this one question alone. But in my view, for a beginner just setting out, simply imagining these energy centres as a coloured sphere rotating clockwise would be a good start. Of course, and this is true with MANY things in life, once you become experienced then you will find all manner of differences can apply in your particular case.
<br>
<br>
I liken it to when I used to race motorcycles. We all had what we would call our "Racer's Bible". It was a very thick looseleaf book that gave exact details of every section of every racetrack in the UK.
<br>
<br>
In particular it gave details of the optimum racing line for every curve. It was all very well studying this, but when you actually came to do it there were around 20 or so other people battling for that same optimum racing line! Of course, it was sheer experience that taught a person how to remain competitive and hold a dominant position virtually regardless of where on the track they were positioned. But it would be sheer folly for a beginner to think they could attempt this.
<br>
<br>
So everyone tended to first learn the theory, then they began to put that theory into practice. Then, as they developed some experience, they could start to be creative as to their dynamic positioning.
<br>
<br>
I feel this is similar in that once you become experienced you could imagine your energy centres any old how and they would spark off for you. Well, that is how it is with me now. For example, I can spark off my Yellow centre in about 5 seconds just by thinking about sparking it off. I don't have to visualise anything. Yet when I first started it took me ages to find this one centre, and now it's the easiest to ignite for me. Weird.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Interesting.
<br>
<br>
The alternating rotations are mentioned at the following website in relation to the directional flow of the Ida and Pingala. It also attributes a difference between male and female rotational pattern. If you truly have the ability, perhaps you can test this out for yourselves.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the link.
<br>
<br>
The problem is, and this is one of the main reasons why I never now use the word Chakra, are the sheer amount of religious and other belief constructs that have been built up over the thousands of years.
<br>
<br>
There are bodily energy centres that pertain to our physical form. Now, superimposed upon that phenomenon are all manner of belief constructs
<i>
 about
</i>
these bodily energy centres. With myself, I pay close attention to the former and simply ignore the latter.
<br>
<br>
I took a look at the link you gave and, if I may say, the website is typical of the many that do the rounds. With me, as I say, I make a clear distinction between the simple movement of energy throughout the body that I can see and measure, and many people's religious or other
<i>
 <b>
  beliefs
 </b>
</i>
[/b] about the way energy is utilised by the physical body. The two are VASTLY different.
<br>
<br>
Again, I present the notion that creative energies tend to spin clockwise. That is how nature is aligned generally and we are a part of nature. Plus, there is no real difference between male and female when it comes to their energetic construction. There is obviously a slightly different accent on one or two factors that ultimately serve to cause a diferent balance of bodily hormones. But our basic energetic makeup is the same.
<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that, in the past and I still see evidence of that today, in mystical and religious circles sexism has been allowed to run rife and women have been seen to be inferior. Pretty awful when you think about it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Good point Frank, about clockwise being a good starting point.
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
<br>
I was exactly the same when I first began too - with not worrying about turning them any direction at all, but rather being focused on the colour.  I have always found that this works to energise the center.
<br>
<br>
Also, another method I have used, which seems to work quite well, is visualising a flower opening up, rather than the whole spinning sphere thing.

I've got a bit of a question about the centers thing.
<br>
<br>
I've just gone and had a look at the web page that BlueEarthJacket posted, although the colours are pretty much correct, when I see them, they're not in the same places as on the diagram.
<br>
<br>
So what gives?
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
<br>
<br>
Steve

<section>
Great analogy you used earlier Frank! It does put things into perspective.
<br>
<br>
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
<br>
Until you put it into practice.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I guess one of the more important points about the energy centers is not so much exatly how they're spinning, but the idea that every time you focus your attention on them, you're effectively making them more active.
<br>
<br>
In keeping with your thoughts here, my Reiki master also looked at the idea of just going with the clockwise spin for each centre just to get people used to working with them. There are so many books out by so many experts on the subject that all have their own take on it. It's so easy to get confused by the hows that you can forget the why's.
<br>
<br>
I've also heard about the differences between males and females here, but when a group of mine tested the chakras with pendulums, we found no difference.
<br>
<br>
Like you, I found it effective enough to just visualise each centre opening up and see the colour coming from it. It doesn't help to get too caught up in the technicalities.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.
