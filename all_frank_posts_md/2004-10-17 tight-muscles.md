Does anybody have ideas/methods of working through chronically tight muscles?
<br>
<br>
I have very tight calves, and a very tight midback. Â Often, when I do relaxation--prior to an OBE-attempt--I feel unable to really let go of these muscles.
<br>
<br>
I try running extra energy through the muscles, and of course, I often stretch beforehand. ...It may be I'm simply not caring enough for myself physically, or doing enough stretching.
<br>
<br>
Anybody have any ideas?

Stop doing OBE attempts and just work on relaxation excercises for a few days.

From what you say I'd suggest paying more serious attention to your frame. Muscles that are so inflexible are almost always a sign of far worse problems to come. Lower back tension is often a sign of bad posture generally. It might pay you to look at how you are using yourself throughout the day. How you carry yourself while standing and how you sit.
<br>
<br>
There is the other point of how much weight you are carrying. Too much weight around the middle places great strain on the lower to middle back region. Walking is a great tension releaser. Particularly walking in the countryside as you get a variety of surfaces and the whole body gets exercised without you really knowing it.
<br>
<br>
As a shorter-term solution I'd suggest for you to try having a hot bath beforehand with some herbal muscle relaxer in the water. Sometimes if I've been overdoing it on the farm the muscles around my shoulders can feel a little sore. So I have a good soak with a mix of essential oils in the water which works wonders.

Like Frank said warm baths are good, I like to sit in the tub as the water drains out. As the water level falls I imagine the tension draining out as well.
