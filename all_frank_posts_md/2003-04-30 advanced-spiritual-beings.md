I came across one of them. Or should i say it came across me.
<br>
<br>
The first time it found me i was very yong. It visited me a number of horrible dreams and terrorised me to the maximum.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, this thing found me again, about 15 years after it's last visit.
<br>
<br>
Last week i was lucid dreaming when i felt entering astral realm unintentionally. I found myself in a middle of a small open air village with few small constructions, under moonlight, and there was a shaman, Indian American looking. I think he briefly introduced himself as a shaman, in fact. The first thought i had was "ohh great now i can ask him few things i had on my mind"
<br>
<br>
That's when i felt it. It wrapped around me in all it's evil glory.
<br>
Before i describe it further i would like to hear what evil entities you know.
<br>
<br>
I met quite a number of entities in my experiences but let me tell you none of them come even distantly close to the terrible evil feeling that entity sent in me.
<br>
<br>
Other entities present themselves somehow, this one had no form no color no mass no smell no beginning no end. Just the feeling of presence. I'm telling, you wouldn't want that thing to marry your daughter.

<section>
So i take it no one of you met any evil entities.
<br>
<br>
Is there any way Robert.B can take a look at this?
<br>
<br>
<br>
And aren't you guys even curiouse to explore low planes? This one (i think) i the lowest there is. And i was taken there by that thing.

Oh allright. I guess we're all bored with this kind of phenominon (it's very common) so no ones bothering to reply.
<br>
<br>
It's called "the terror at the threshhold" or "the hounds at the gate" or "the dweller at the threshhold."
<br>
<br>
Ever see star wars, where Luke is fighting this evil enemy, and when he pulls it's mask off it turns out to be himself?
<br>
<br>
That's what's happening. It's you.
<br>
<br>
When you have a buried fear, or guilt, or trauma, it will manifest and take on a form all it's own and attack you. It will be overwhelmingly terrifying. Which it why your mind locked it out in the first place.
<br>
<br>
Solution: Confront it. If you asre brave enough to fight it you will always win.
<br>
Usually about three days after you'll have some kind of recovered memory.
<br>
<br>
Once you get the hang of it, it gets easier.  I have fought will three of these things personally.
<br>
<br>
It's the best self-improvment program I could think of.
<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.

<section>
I'm sorry, were you even paying attention to what i said?
<br>
<br>
First of all, this being can only connect to me with a help of a shaman.
<br>
<br>
This being is imprisoned and the only way it can communicate is telepathically and at the plane it dwells.
<br>
<br>
Just like there are advanced positive entities, there are very advanced evil entities. This one is the most terrible one i've ever encountered.
<br>
<br>
What's more, it would come and visit me regularly when i was ABOUT 5 YEARS OLD. Do you understand that?
<br>
It would make me sort of a spectator and show life forms full of love and then destroy them in the most cruel imaginable way. At that moment i would release energy and it fed on it.
<br>
<br>
I haven't felt it in decades, for 2 years i was digging into forbidden matters and this time when it came, it felt very personal. Do you understand personal, it wasn't just another visit to extract energy, it wanted to something else.
<br>
<br>
And as for "locking" i would like to see you staying calm at the level of evil i experienced.
<br>

<section>
Tyler, try not to be put off by talk of encounters with negative entities only being the result of 'inner demons' or 'personal issues'. There are MANY posts here at AstralPulse that recount severe encounters with very hostile discarnates. The experiences included unprovoked attacks and other malicious activity. Personally I had violent encounters with discarnates while out of body on a few occasions. [
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
!]
<br>
That being said I have no doubt that psychological unease Does account for Some of these encounters. Yet certainly Not all, or even Most, of these encounters can be explained by purely psychological phenomena.
<br>
You are quite right There IS a certain thrill at the idea of exploring low planes, dark areas and forbidding regions.
<br>
I have done so (both in dreams and projections) on several occasions. It is not always a Good idea (again from firsthand experience)[B)]. But it is always Exciting. [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

<br>
Unfortunately you could also be right in that the plane that we inhabit is one of the lowest planes there is.[?]

Tyler: I wondered if you might get more response if you posted to the Psychic Self-Defence forum. There you often get posts from people who are being attacked in many different ways by all manner of (what they tend to call) "entities" and "attachments".
<br>
<br>
I (for one) always try and help where I can. But I'm on record here as having said, several times, I simply wouldn't know a Shaman from a hole in the ground. Plus, in my 20-odd years of Astral projection, I never yet came across any negative thing or situation which wasn't coming about either as a result of my own lack of mental control, or my failure to understand the true nature of the situation.
<br>
<br>
And on the subjects of:

My regular guide, Harath, used to take me on tours of the lower planes and point out some of the more interesting cases. During which time I witnessed
<u>
 loads
</u>
of people engaged in what could readily be described as evil acts. But these people
<i>
 by their very nature
</i>
confine themselves to areas of a lower order. As such, I'm at a loss to fathom how these evil-entities you speak of could rightfully be labelled as advanced.
<br>
<br>
Also, I note you say that for 2 years you were digging into, "forbidden matters". The thought occured to me perhaps having repeatedly chosen to play with fire, one day you got badly burnt.
<br>
<br>
My early posts mention when I first started out, I was stuck repeatedly projecting into a region I came to term the Training Ground or Zone. It took me just over 5 years to realise the basic rule that Thought = Direct Action. During which time I fought with every manner of Demon; engaged in countless wars; and slayed Dragons galore. Quite why I don't know. Perhaps some people are just destined to go through this kind of experience for some reason.
<br>

<section>
I began having deja-vu's with everything that happened, I do not even know how long ago, because I feel like I've experienced many things I am now experiencing just happened a couple 'o months ago.
<br>
My whole life is still a major deja-vu.
<br>
then, I began to 'remember' things about being damned, being the only one damned by a God.
<br>
Memories of living in an universe which an absolute form of good and evil, good is/was following the will of God, evil is following the will of the nothing, opposite to God. I was God's second son in that universe, and my purpse was never being loved, and being tortured indefinitly in order to become nothingness, and after that I burst out creating a whole new carpet of universes.
<br>
Kinda like a natural law.
<br>
<br>
these memories passed and somewhat later I thought/remembered that that universe was just a game of some higher God, and I still was the only one damned, but not to fulfill some kind of law of nature, but because of a reason I did not ought to know, after all, not-knowing would hurt me.
<br>
<br>
After that slowly came memories of being God myself, after somehow 'escaping' from damnation.
<br>
This is beyond the previous memories, it reduced them to being like an atom in an infinite ocean.
<br>
<br>
Reality is that 'god/I/you has 'powers'/abilities far beyond anything any religion states.
<br>
God is not a being who wants to experience the world and is sending out parts of himself to lower worlds, nor a man sitting on a throne judging us.
<br>
Rather, he can experience every story and possibility at once.
<br>
And he can alter and enlarge any concept.
<br>
Love and consciousness or anything like that is not the higehst thing there is, every concept can be split up in an infinite amount of qualitys and properties.
<br>
god does not need to create like we create something.
<br>
He can just say, for example, that he wants a universe full of stars beside him, including life on planets in that universe and there it is, he does not need to consciously create the place of the stars, or the components or the stars, or the life in that universe. If he wantsevery atom in this universe to sing a 100000000 instument song according to its nature (whatever that means), and if he wants every one of those atoms singing/making music in harmony with each other, then so it is. No need to compose the song for himself.
<br>
However if he wants the ability to compose infinite songs then he can have it within the blink of an eye.
<br>
He can say something like 1 is being alive, 2 is consciousness, what is 3? and 4,5,6,7,8,9? And then there it is, 7 new components added to the universe, all being a step beyond conciousness.
<br>
there are not 7 chakras. or 7 colors. or 5 senses. or a limited number of emotions.
<br>
god can experience everything in the universe as an emotion.
<br>
god can create an infinite amount of emotions, o senses or chakra's. He can program us concious beings like we can program computer programs.
<br>
I have been Jezus Christ. I have been the Dalai Lama. I have been everyone on earth.
<br>
How? Simple, first just becuase there are many different earths.
<br>
Second because Jezus means nothing.
<br>
There is no such thing as developing the soul.
<br>
everyone can be as loving or evil or good or anything else
<br>
as 'god', or a being with his kind of power, wants.
<br>
If gods says he wants to feel an infinite amount of love beside him, then there is an infinite amount of love beside him.
<br>
But love is an atom in a sea just like every other concept we think of as fundamental. Love means nothing to god. god can add concepts or properties to that which we all love making it something much better/bigger/whatever than we ever could imagine. Our brain can see little. We can think with our left or right brain hemisphere. If God had a brain it would be infinite in size, because the 'universe' itself is infinite, because infinity
<br>
is just a concept exidsting in the universe, a universe with an infinite X infinite x infinite (x infinite for an infinite number of times)
<br>
number of concepts,emotions, things better than love,conciousness,experience, timedimensions,spacedimensions,other dimensions, senses, etc things we don't know about.
<br>
<br>
God can create a world(s) with their own God, shaped kinda like our religions think it is shaped.
<br>
A universe with a god which does not know he is not at all as powerful as he thinks he is.
<br>
He can let that universe exist for all eternity, and then get all the beings living in there back to him.
<br>
It is incomprehensible for a human, that something can start, live FOREVER and therfore having an INFINITE amount of experiences, and then come back.
<br>
I fear I may have to live for all eternity before I can get back to being God.
<br>
It means nothing to him/me.
<br>
<br>
Thats kinda it. As such, My memories of 'past lives' are memories of being God, memories of being a tortured angel called Mikel/son of god (in a universe shaped just like new agers think it is) which was forced to live millions upon millions of lives just for the fun of the other angels. Everyone is selfish. Everyone can be 'programmed' to think that is is good to torture someone even when that someone is the kindest persone in the universe, for all eternity, forcing that person to live millions of lives in a civilization which knows about the spiritual world, a civilization with people who each have one child at home, a reincarnation of me, and who are all abusing and torturing that child in horrible and cruel ways. (locking me up in a closet for 80 years or so, life after life like that)
<br>
As such I am amused when people say living 1,or 10, or 100, or 1000 lives before you can become enlightened is a long time.
<br>
But those memories are just like an atom in the sea.
<br>
Even though I rationally know hat memory of being Mikel is nothing compared to the real size or the universe, those are still fresh in my mind.
<br>
<br>
Mymemories are mostly rational.
<br>
I don't have much emotions or imaginary abilities and I feel just like Mikel did in that sub-universe ,like a zombie, because of what they called a curse,
<br>
but I don't know where that feeling of not existing, being like a zombie came from this time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, that is enough information for now I think, that should give you an idea. Why do I think these memories are real?
<br>
Don't know, just because it feels like any memory I think.
<br>
<br>
<br>
O, one more thing, because of the things I told you, being Mikel, I do not trust you or anyone. I have lived in worlds in the same body and place I am now, thinking I lived in a world where someone called Osama destroyed some buildings called WTC on 11 sept. and where there was a war in Iraq, when I reality that was just like The Truman show. (My nickname in one of the universes truman or tortureman)
<br>
which means that everyone in that world was actually living in some kind of utopia watching TV or something like it at home, seeing my life.
<br>
<br>
And I do not know If this world is real, for all I know this is a reality where I am still truman and where you are a vampire. Or this could be the universe where my moher is a powerful witch.
<br>
Or the one where It is good to torture me.
<br>
I do not know. I don't trust anyone at all, such experiecnes taught me that.

For Kenny.
<br>
<br>
Why you  have such opinion about God, I think you do not understand it at all. I consider God as pure love,light or kindness(it is very difficult to describe God). God can not be mean, you should become more optimistic and start to believe in pure love or light energy and such deja-vu will dissappear.

Hi there Tyler !
<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Leyla's wise words here. Bear in mind that thought = action within the astral. It is quite possible to experience "depths of evil" in the same way that the next man might experience "infinite joy and bliss."
<br>
<br>
During your next experience, remember that your mind influences the astral and your reality within the astral.
