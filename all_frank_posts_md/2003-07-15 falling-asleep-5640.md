Greetings,
<br>
Does anyone have tips on how to stay awake while trying to promote an OBE. I've been trying unsucessfuly for quite some time. I always fall asleep I've tried a few self hypnosis tapes for astral travel and the same thing I fall asleep. Please Help.

This is a common problem. The way I avoid it is to project early morning. I also remember Nick saying just recently how he projects late afternoon, after work (as he has an early start). The general concensus is trying before your normal sleep-time can often (though not always) be self-defeating.

I would suggest passively watching those hypnagogic visuals that form under the eyelids before sleep. The hypnagogic state is the half-awake and half-asleep state before (and after) proper sleep. Visuals begin and eventually become more complex to form stories that become sleep dreams. So try passively watching those random visuals. It will help you to remain mentally awake as your physical body falls asleep.

Good Luck [
