<section>
Hello, I am new to this site but wanted to share with you my recent meditation experiences and hopefully glean information as to what is going on. I will try to put together different anomilies that are related to a single meditation session. Currently I am reading Astral Dynamics and am aware of Etheric body and energy movements.
<br>
<br>
OK, about 10 days ago I decided to start meditation in earnest in my small ofiice at work at lunch time. It is a time I have regular with minimal interference. I left the overhead flourescent lights on just incase someone came in and I didn't look too foolish sitting in the dark.
<br>
<br>
Spec:
<br>
When my eyes are shut I can see this spec in between my eyes about 4 inches in front of me. On further attention on the spec more specs can be seen and begin to swirl in an anti-clockwise direction the view looks like one of those satalite pictures of a hurricane. sometimes the swirl becomes larger and is tilted on its side like looking at a galaxy. Swirling in the vortex are many more particles, this can fill up my whole vision field and is often hard to maintain.
<br>
<br>
Swirling Vortex:
<br>
I am undecided weather this is non physical phenomina or something inside my eyes that I am able to see. If I look at a blank wall I can see this spec and swirl, which leads me to believe its an internal view of my physical eye. I would suppose that an eye is filled with fluid and bio material that can reflect on the seeing device.
<br>
<br>
Colors:
<br>
After 5-10 minutes of the meditation I start to see Gold and Purple wafts, whisps of smoke like veils ebbing away in and out. I had now shifted my focus to the flow of these two colors. After a few more minutes the Indigo Purple color dominates the Gold color until almost all Gold has gone, only traces of it zoning in. On this one occassion the purple settled and all of a sudden became clear as crystal like looking into a giant Amethyst. It had a 3 dimensional appearnce of depth. I had to struggle to hold it but did so for what seamed like 5 minutes or so. This was quite a breakthrough for me because before meditation was; ok close eyes; wait; nothing happens; whoop de doo. But now something tangable had happened. After that meditation I had a 3 dimensional vision field when I closed my eyes for at least 3 days. Even doing a slow blink I could see a 3 dimensional space, not purple but black. I have since lost the 3D effect and dont seam to be able to get it back. After experimenting with lights on and off, only the lights on produce the Indigo veils. With lights off I only see some Gold and an off white that gets brighter and dims back to black. If I try to look beyond the swirl spec I get a shift in consciousness but I cant get the 3D back.
<br>
<br>
Tingling:
<br>
I have found I can slip into a trance quite quickly, I know this because I can feel my body tingling and my hands feel like lead. The tingling is very uncomfortable and I feel like my head is in a vice grip. Also a lot of presuure on both my eyes like they are about to explode. After meditation my physical eyes feel very sore, but the tingling and headband pressure subside. The palms of my hands also have a lot of tingling going on. Experimenting with this, I have found I can move the energy around inside my head, like moving a ball of energy around from my forehead through the pallet and into the throat then it goes straight back up to top. This is the most worrying aspect of the meditation for me as it leaves me kind of drained and edgy like my nerves are shot. This is probaly high activity in my Brow Chakra but Im not sure how to channel it or something. The pain in my eyes concerns me. Sometimes if I open my mouth a little my tongue tip feels like its glued to my pallet.
<br>
<br>
Generic Visuals:
<br>
I keep seeing bits and pieces of maybe a human face apeears out of the particles, then bright dots that come towards me and vanish. My voice keeps commenting on whats going on and sometimes I will drift into a daydream and then after a while remember I am trying to meditate and come back to the stuff in my view field. This seamingly abstract state occupies the majority of the session usually an hour long.
<br>
<br>
Astral Visuals:
<br>
After maybe 35 minutes in feeling numb, tingly &amp; sore but at the same time content. Flashes or scenes come to me usually of lush forests, Alaskan like lakes and mountains or jungle rainforests.
<br>
One in particular stood out as it seamed to last about 4 seconds a long time. I saw two large birds soaring over a rain forest, I was behind them as if I was seeing through the eyes of a third bird. The staggering thing was the colors of the plumage, a deep crimson color with a dark black underdown just pulstaing in radiant color. The neck and belly part of the birds had a silvery almost fish like scaley appearence. I got the impression that these birds were huge. During the percieved 4 seconds I was able to get a view of a Tolkien looking citidel nestled within the tree canopies. It was like watching a hi definition tv or something. I have never seen such birds before, but I now cant forget them.
<br>
<br>
Movement:
<br>
Sometimes I will have the feeling of falling, ascending, moving forwards or backwards. A butterfly in my stomach brings me back to C1. I just wanted to note also that I have a great fear of OBE and don't relish the experience of it, I have a lot of fear.
<br>
<br>
Breathing:
<br>
Breathing in deeply seems to affect the deepness of the trance state. When I take a deep breath I feel myself goin deeper. I have noted that the majority of my breaths seam shallow. Checking on my breathing takes me to C1 for a second but it reassures me somehow.
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to share this with you all as I don't have anyone to share it with. Everyone around me seams so stuck in the mundane.
<br>
<br>

It sounds like your 'seeing' your third-eye Chakra.  The colors and rotation are correct.
<br>
<br>
Try quieting your inner monolog.  It's your mind, and it's not involved in what your doing (I know that sounds funny, but Mind and Ego aren't involved, you wnat inner quiet).
<br>
<br>
Fear of an OBE makes it difficult to project.  So quiet the fear and try something different.  Perhaps Far Viewing?  Also called Remove Viewing.  Strictly speaking your not OBE'ing in the classical sense, so you shouldn't have the fear you associate with it.  You are basically 'seeing' things through Astral telescopic vision.  You can also work on pure Astral vision, just don't be suprised by who/what you see about you, it's normal.

Interesting visuals.
<br>
<br>
Pretty good results for just 10 days of practice. I might want to try flourescent lighting now. [

<br>
<br>
Your experiences correspond with my own practice, as the early markers when full contact with the physical senses is lost, or an entire new perceptual window will open up where the visuals you experience may take on a permanent more stable form.
<br>
<br>
You might be in a for rollercoaster soon.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting. [^]

<br>
<br>
Yes, good results considering the timescale.
<br>
<br>
The uncomfortable sensations will subside as you get used to them, so please don't worry. The more you concentrate on them the more significant they become. So try to just put them to the back of your mind. Tingling and feelings of pressure, falling and ascending, or other kinds of sensations of movement, are all very
<u>
 normal
</u>
at first.
<br>
<br>
What you are calling generic visuals sounds very much like the Monroe Focus 12 state. Here you can see all kinds of abstract images or textures, or often sounds such as knocking and wrenching sounds, or maybe screaming and whistling sounds. Again, all very normal. Try to think of this phase as somthing you pass through. Many people use it as a signpost that tells them they are well on their way to the next step, which are the astral visuals. So try not to spend too long here. It should last only a few seconds, maybe 30 seconds absolute maximum.
<br>
<br>
<u>
 The visuals you are getting are what you need to aim for
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
After a while they will become stable rather than snapshots of a few seconds or so. Then you are in a position where it is like being at the cinema watching a large screen. Note: you should aim for this stage to take up most of the time of your meditation.
<br>
<br>
Once you are comfortable with viewing the screen, take a deep breath and mentally step into into it. At which point you will find yourself immersed within the non-physical, or the astral as people generally call it. Then you can take a walk around, or fly around if you want. And that's it, you've done it!
<br>
<br>
From that point you are free to explore and interact with your environment, meet people and so forth. Just like you would do in the physical. You say you have great fear of obe but that's exactly what you are doing now! Please put aside all the old notions of floating on the ceiling looking down at your sleeping body, meeting demons and dragons, and all that other whacky stuff. That's so past its sell-by date it's unreal.
<br>
<br>
There's nothing to be frightened of. But always keep in mind you will be in an environment where thought equals action. So please remember to keep a check on what you are thinking at all times. The best state of mind is to stay neutral, but then release just a mild feeling of curiosity. In a way just as you are doing now. Simply keep that curious state of mind and you will be fine.
<br>
<br>
If you happen to find yourself getting a little fearful, watch out because you can easily get yourself locked into an ever worsening downward spiral of negativity. Which is a complete waste of time. The way to deal with it, is the moment you find circumstances flowing away from you, quickly switch back to physical, take a few deep breaths to clear the mind, and project again.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

The swirling colors arent really anything, its just what your mind does to amuse itself when your eyes are close. It happens to mee everytime i close my eyes. the movemine phemonon kindof intrest me too beacuse i have too felt that feeling also while i was trying to scan a friend while i was meditating... interesting.

I found when I first started I got a huge amount of hypnogogic images and swirling colours, including quite vivid looking (and moving) faces. Havent really seen anything like that for months now, but theyve been replaced by starfield looking effects (or sorta fuzzy noise looking stuff) and more bright/vivid 3d light shows, like walls of light or something.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if my own mind was creating the faces originally, as I remember being a bit freaked by seeing them, and after a while I could watch them from a detached p.o.v and be amused by the scary faces... Then, gone altogether...?
<br>
<br>
Apart from that, since I started yoga several months ago, Ive also gotten way better at getting into trance, and lately cant even feel if my mouth is open or closed... I honestly cant understand why there isnt more yoga posts on here, I find it very related.
<br>
<br>
Your astral visuals stuff sounds awesome though, I could go for seeing that sorta stuff!

Hey Gary,
<br>
<br>
You are the first person I've encountered who's described the spinning galaxy thing that I also see.  I believe this is part of the strobe effect Robert Bruce describes in Astral Dynamics, especially because mine usually comes with a concussion-like feeling and a bright flash, then I feel it sucking me out of my body.  Bruce says that this is an intense "strobe" of energy into your brow center and you're seeing it clairvoyantly in your third eye.   If you concentrate hard enough, you can eventually make this become a vision screen where you could see psychic visions.  So far I've only been able to do this once.
<br>
<br>
I also get the pressure on my eyes and a tight band around my head.  As I understand it, this just means that you've overstimulated your brow chakra.  It's not a big deal, just stop stimulating it for a few days and be more gentle next time.
<br>
<br>
I also see the lush, beautiful places and have been told that this is like a remote viewing.  I wish I knew which place I was seeing.
<br>
<br>
As for the feeling of falling in your stomach, I just read in Astral Dynamics that this may be your projected double re-entering your body.

I'm writing this in hopes that others have had this experience.
<br>
I too have seen the galaxy visuals. And the 3D experience, which were the most amazing and what I'm assuming is called "remote viewing"?
<br>
I too, would meditate, relax, see some swirls and what not, but then that was it. Last week was a major breakthur! It was exacty analogous to the precise moment when you're looking at those pictures that initially look like nothing but black and white static, and then suddenly, they have this amazing 3D depth that you feel like you can step into. Thats what I saw. I continued to see them even into the next day, when ever I closed my eyes, I'd hear a very subtle, high pitched swirly-whistling sound and then "see" everything. It was the most amazing thing I've had happen to me to date. Some of the visions appeard to be bathed in a very white light. Have you ever seen pictures of rock stars, on stage, all the lights are out, except for the 1 giant spot light on them ...and the background looks to be milky? Its prolly the fog machines combined with the spot light...anyway, thats the light I'm talking about. It reminded me of the light near death people speak of. I also had the distinct impression that I had run into other "beings" as it were, and they knew I was there! The whole experience seemed to last all night yet only exist in little bits and fragments at the same time. I'm sorry if thats hard to grasp but its the only way I can describe it. So I have the distinct memory of "going up to" a "being" in sheer amazment and "saying" to it.."wow you are really there aren't you?"...and the thing "smiled" and went its way. It didnt smile, cuz I didn't see it..again hard to explain...but the best analogy is it was as if I were a friendly dog and the thing patted my head, acknowleged me, and was gone.
<br>
I'm a newbie and I'm glad I found the forum. i've been dying to tell someone this, anyone. I'm not religous at all. I have no idea what happened but it was incredible. Was it just me wandering around inside the 80% of my brain that science says I dont use?..sort of a mental free-for-all?...did I verify the existence of dimensions beyond my understanding? I hope to begin a lifelong quest for these answers.
