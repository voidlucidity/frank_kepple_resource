Well where to start...I am new, as you probably figured out, and thought this was as good a time to start posting as ever!  Nay introduced me to this site and I am so glad that she did!  I am interested in all of these topics and look forward to getting my feel around the place.  I am a very lucid dreamer and dream almost every night.  I do feel as though I have been visited by spirits in my dreams and I find that so cool!  Any way..that is a brief intro to me!  Hope to talk with some of you along the way

Hey, welcome to the forums.
<br>
<br>
Your name gave me an interesting memory of the ladybugs in the football field at my elementary school a long time ago.
