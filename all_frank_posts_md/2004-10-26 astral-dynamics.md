<section>
Hello. New member. Well, I have been visiting the boards for awhile but not really joined. I know some things about astral projecting but I never really gave it a shot. I read all about Treatise on OOBE and I thought it was good. I am thinking about buying "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce.
<br>
Does anyone have good results from the book? Like, the techs in the book worked or something?

Indeed.

I even bought it twice

Ditto, buy the book.
<br>
It was a "path through the darkness" for me.

Astral Dynamics is a great book. Full of very useful, wide-ranging info. It's a real down-to-earth practical kind of book which is packed full of instructions together with all manner of hints and tips. Great book for beginners especially, but even people who are fairly well practised at the art will pick up quite a bit too. Triple the price and it would still be darned good value IMO... highly recommended.
<br>

I've read them all:  Robert Monroe, Sylvan Muldoon, Oliver Fox.  And Robert Bruce has definitely elbowed his way into that elite group of experts.
<br>
<br>
As far as books go, Bruce's book is all the book you will ever need.  But actual success depends largely on your wanting and willing it -- thinking about it all the time, and practicing all the time.
<br>
<br>
My old Guru told me that Will equals Time, and Time equals Will.  You think you want something... well, how much Time do you put into it?
<br>
<br>
Regarding Out of Body Experiences... how many years did you spend just lazily falling asleep?  Well, you might actually need to take an awful lot of time before you can change the momentum established by all that lazy sleeping.   My old Guru caught me smoking cigerettes and he asked me to quit.  I told him I was trying.  He asked me how long I've been smoking.  I told him "3 years"  That is when he told me about Will equals Time.... and that it would probably take me 3 years to quit.  He wasn't far off.
<br>
<br>
Effort and intensity are probably a good multiplier, but, basically, we need to put in the Time.
<br>
<br>
Oh, by the way, Monroe, Muldoon, and Fox are probably all out of print, but Bruce DOES do a good job.

Buy it through Barnes and Nobles.  Of all the On Line Publishers, they ship the fastest.
