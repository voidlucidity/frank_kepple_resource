In Monroe's first book, he refers part of the astral as locale II. Here, thought is action / energy / creation.
<br>
<br>
He states that on his many trips there, he has noticed one constant....Occasionally, there is a herald sound, and all of the occupants in that particular zone lie down on their backs, as "He" passes. Typically, one of the occupants in the zone will be taken away, never to return. Whilst lying down, all the occupants face away from "him".
<br>
<br>
As soon as "he" has passed, the occupants resume their day to day activities...
<br>
<br>
My question to those of you who can project is, have you experienced anything consistent with the above ? or does it ring a bell at all ?

<section>
p.s. just want to clarify the above.....
<br>
<br>
The "he" that I am referring to is not Monroe himself.....When "he" approaches, Monroe says that he lies down with all the other occupants, so as not to look out of place.

Monroe's Local II is a region that nowadays would be termed from Focus 22 to the start of the Belief System regions at Focus 24.
<br>
<br>
F22 is the point where consciousness dissociates entirely from the Physical. This is the beginning of the regions where it is demonstrated that what we call "thought" is in fact a primary energy (thought = instantaneous action). In other words, within these regions, as you think so it becomes all around you (in glorious 3D Technicolour).
<br>
<br>
F23 is populated by people who are dead but cannot move on for whatever reason. Maybe through trauma, or insanity, or maybe they are just asleep not realising they are physically dead, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
F24 Is the beginning of what are commonly called the Belief Sytem Regions, i.e. F24; F25 &amp; F26. Here you find people who close-mindedly subscribed to a strict set of beliefs while Physical. Beliefs can be religious but not necessarily so.
<br>
<br>
F24 is probably where Monroe came across the people you describe. The actions these people were involved in does sound weird, but I've seen a lot weirder.

...I'll bet you have ! i won't ask what ...!
<br>
<br>
I was just trying to ascertain whether or not his experience had any "objectivity"....his account gave the impression that it was objective (at least for him)....
<br>
<br>
anyone else got any observations ?!
<br>
cheers

Hi there major Tom !
<br>
<br>
My understanding of the different focus levels, is that they are not spatially / geographically related.....a person travels between them by focussing his / her intent, and "going" there.
<br>
<br>
So, although you may be experiencing travel through a vortex like structure or tunnel, perhaps it is just your conciousness "tuning-in" to a different "frequency"........but who knows  ?! perhaps different levels are reached through travelling along structures like you  describe !!

<br>
<br>
Focus levels are states of mental consciousness. Starting from C1 being normal Physical consiousness.
<br>
<br>
In other words, in this state, your physical body is the primary mental focus and you are receiving sensations from your five physical senses. As you turn your attention away from your physical body, your mental focus changes. As it does so, you begin to perceive various other mental states that are labelled according to the common factors of each state.
<br>
<br>
In his early work, Monroe refers to two "Locales" which have now been taken over by his later work. Locale 1 refers to the state beginning Focus 15 through to Focus 20. Which is just before the Astral Bridge zone at Focus 21. Cross that bridge and you enter Locale 2 as described earlier.

<section>
sorry, my misunderstanding...we're both agreed on the same thing I think !!
<br>
<br>
well, I do think that a map will be possible to make. I wonder what it will look like ?!
<br>
<br>
I think that it would have to be created and maintained in the Astral, perhaps in Focus 27.
