The Dyslexics Guide To The Galaxy (Solved By The Real Dyslexic)
<br>
<br>
As a dyslexic myself I have struggled through school learning stuff I didn't need to learn, I didn't want to learn maths I didn't want to learn English I didn't want to do art although I've been referred to as a genius in art, I didn't want to do it because I had to draw what they told me to draw, I didn't like technology lets face it I didn't like being told what to do by people who didn't' know what they were doing. I remember once in junior school it was playtime and began to rain, me using my mind decided I would go back into the cloak room and get my coat to ware, although this was against regulations I reasoned that nobody would mind since I was getting my coat and it was raining, how wrong was I, a teacher found me in the cloakroom pulled me by my hood into a cloakroom hook, I begun to lecture him in his own stupidity and his inability to see past himself. I was escorted to the head teachers office, (this was a really scary thing back then) I awaited to see the head master now I was full of confidence because I knew I was in the right, the master beckoned me into the office, I walked in he asked me what happened I explained the stupidity of his staff in there inability to reason logically, I explained to him as if I was his master and he the teacher, I remember to this day that he was very confused with the authority of which I spoke to him. I was released from the office without detention with the headmaster under my belt.
<br>
<br>
Now the master was very strict he ran the school as if it was the military, now in the school playground we all used to play football next to the swimming pool. A 10-foot tall fence surrounded the pool. It was against regulations to retrieve the football if it went over the fence, for years and years children had played football and gone through the hole in the fence to retrieve the ball. Now one weekend the fence was fixed, we came back to school after around a week the fence was broken again, the ball was kicked over the fence and one of my friends went to retrieve it, the master came from his office, he was angry because the fence that had just been fixed was now broken again. All the children were afraid of the master, again I confronted him, I explained calmly and perfectly that the fence has always had a hole in it as long as we had been in the school and that if we didn't break the fence someone else would, then I explained that it was just a fence and that he shouldn't worry about a fence. Again I undermined his authority, but this time in full view of everyone, he went back to the office with his tale between his legs.
<br>
<br>
Now I never saw this kind of behaviour as unusual, all I did was speak my mind and my truth and he could do nothing about it. Now sorry I had to speak about all that, I shall now explain the causes of dyslexia
<br>
<br>
In my posts I have talked much about light decoding, now a dyslexic translates as an unconscious light decoder, this meaning a dyslexic already knows all the useless stuff that is being rammed down there necks is worthless information. Dyslexics, like myself have had are ability tempered with by people who thought we were stupid, a dyslexic has trouble writing words and getting them mixed up because he/she decodes all the light around them and the light they manifest at the same time, this is why dyslexics use more of there brain then non dyslexics, and check this out! It is commonly known that dyslexic's inappropriately use the word "and", we are told by many dumiii's that we shouldn't use the word "and" as much as we do. Now dyslexics use the word "and" in a subconscious hinting manner, for "and" spelt backwards equals DNA, DNA equals displayed light pattern, not only this it is blatantly obvious that while the dyslexic is being forced to unlearn there ability they are trying to help the dumiii teachers by frequently using the word "and". Therefore us dyslexics aren't the dumiii's.
<br>
<br>
Now another thing I find quite interesting is that in antiquity the blood line would be passed on by the women, I cant remember how to spell the word, but that doesn't matter you all know what I'm on about, anyhow my mother is dyslexic she passed the genes onto me, this is how it works!
<br>
<br>
So to sum it all up, dyslexics aren't the dumiii's you are the dumiii's in denial about that which you do not understand. All dyslexics subconsciously decode light; I myself am a conscious light decoder.
<br>

Awwwwww poor Birdy..
<br>
<br>
If you don't mind, my opinion is you just don't like any authority figures telling you what to do.  You seem to think you know it all already.... you will find that will come right back and bite you in the caboose.

<br>
<br>
And another little tidbit..please stop calling people dumb.  I'm not aware that you've been called that by anyone here, so why put it out there?
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the light thing... I thought it was a simple switching of letters and numbers?
<br>
<br>
I had a really tough time learning in school for many reasons, but I often wonder if I wasn't dyslexic to some extent.
<br>
<br>
I hope you work through what ever it is you're going through, but I promise you, if you would just ease up on the defensive stance you will get alot further.

He he, I got it, I knew there was a connection! I was severely dyslexic too and can relate only too well where you are coming from.

What kind of school has such regulations? These are insane...

So what? People should fight with illogical law if it is possible. Hitler in Nazi Germany came to power because people were to passive and humble.
<br>
<br>
The only thing that concerns me is that word "dumiii" used by BirdMan. I think that not only judging people in this way, but also calling them with such word (that is strangely similiar to "dummy") is offensive. I've seen many "unawakened" people that are much better than many of those "Peace,Love and Light" New Agers.
