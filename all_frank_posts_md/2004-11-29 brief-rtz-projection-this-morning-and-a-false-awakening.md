Hi All,
<br>
Had a funny experience this morning:
<br>
<br>
Woke between about 0400 &amp; 0430 hours, was having an RTZ OBE, no vibrations just some fuzziness and the crackling crunchy gravel and Velcro like sounds.
<br>
<br>
Again I thought the cat was in the room with me as I felt something pushing or stepping on the pillow around my head.
<br>
<br>
It felt like I exited through the left hand side of my head, usual tennis ball sized dimensions, stayed out what felt like a few seconds sat next to my head on the pillow, and then I then blacked out.
<br>
<br>
I then awoke and walked over to the bedroom door to let the cat out, I pulled the door and it started to jam and stick on something, at first I thought that it was probably a stray cat litter stone jammed under the door (as it does!)
<br>
<br>
I pulled harder on the door and become very frustrated, I hear my wife laughing in the kitchen she is wondering what I am up to, we exchange a few words I tell her that I'm tired, I curse the door for being jammed, I soon realise that the plastic buckle on the shoulder strap of my rucksack has got itself wedged under the door and is causing it to scrape and stick.
<br>
<br>
Half asleep I grab the shoulder strap and rucksack and give it a firm yank to free it, frustrated and crotchety from being half awake I push the bedroom door shut firmly and get back into bed.
<br>
<br>
I wake up again at about 0600 hours and realise that the last time I woke up I was actually dreaming and the cat hadn't been in the room after all and the door was never jammed.
<br>
<br>
I felt a little strange the second time that I woke, a bit disoriented, anyway just thought I would share.
<br>
<br>
Cheers
<br>
<br>

Hi Frank,
<br>
It still feels a bit strange now like I have been duped somehow, and by myself too! It all felt so real at the time!
<br>

Cheers
