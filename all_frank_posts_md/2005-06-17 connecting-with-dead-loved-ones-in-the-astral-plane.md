I am a natural born psychic witch who has been projecting in dreams for years but  I have only recently come to study OBE at the encouragement of my spiritual adviser (haven't been able to do  much practical work due to my present situation of sleep deprivation but so far I seem to be a 'natural").  My 41 year old husband (we've been together for 22 years and are soul mates) is dying of cancer with only weeks to live.  Since I've brought him home to die (I'm a nurse and I'm doing100% of his care) we have both had intense Astro projection dreams, visions while awake and spiritual energy in the house (we've had spirits sporadically in the house for years though).  My husband is looking forward to passing over and spirit guides have given me rituals of protection and energy concentration to help us connect again once he "graduates" and they said that I am being "called' to visit the next plane.  My question is whether anyone has had experiences with connecting with loved ones and how you were able to call to them.  The next plane can be confusing and sometimes I feel bombarded by energy.  How can I gain focus to connect with who and what I want when I'm there.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You say you have been projecting for years within your dreams so I would suggest you use this route as a mode of contact with your husband after he chooses to disengage. As he does so, he will enter Transition for real, as it were. At the moment, the visions you are seeing are overlay experiences that help both of you prepare for the time when that final disengagement comes about. This is very normal. Your husband will enter Transition at a point where he feels best able. He will be a little fearful so it is essential that you offer as much reinforcement as you can. Especially as it gets nearer to the time. If you can, you need to keep things as light-hearted as possible as any fear will only drag him down.
<br>
<br>
To connect with him after he disengages is as easy as thinking about him. You have been projecting in dreams so keep doing that and all you will have to do is picture him and you will meet just as you would while physical. It happened to me only in a different way. It was very sudden and rather shocking. It can be confusing, I agree, but you have time on your side. Time to say what you need to say and prepare for that final moment of disengagement.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Alette,
<br>
<br>
I lost my fiance 8 weeks ago in a crash.  Very sudden and unexpected, of course.  Since then, I've had several very vivid and happy meetings with him.  At first, it seemed that he was visiting me in my dreams.  But I was probably unknowingly projecting.  So far all of my projections have just happened on their own, while I sleep.
<br>
<br>
Last night was a bit different.  I knew I was projecting.  Went through different images, but then I cleared them away, and I called his name.  And he came, just like that, immediately.  Not only that, but we went to "Heaven" together!  Or near it--we were outside, and there was this huge silver and gold city that was sending out this dazzling light.  It was the first time that our meeting didn't happen, or seem to happen, in my bedroom.  In another projection, I was talking with someone else, and I told her that I wanted to see my fiance, and just like that he appeared!  So, all you really have to do is just want to see him.
<br>
<br>
It's wonderful, because it really is like being with them physically.  I don't know if it's that way for everyone, but whenever I see my fiance, he's always quite solid, and looks just as he always did--and even better!  He usually has this radiant glow about him, but I can always feel him, just as when he was here in the physical.  Maybe because I just miss his physical presence so much.
<br>
<br>
I know you and your husband are facing something frightening and distressing.  But I think I can promise you that everything is going to be well!  Not that you won't feel grief, of course--I definitely have my share of grief--but just knowing that death is not an end, that he won't have to cope with illness any more, that you're still together, that you're both part of this incredible universe, and that it's not really so different from just being in a different room or a different house... it really has lifted my spirits, and given me a new lease on life!  A new purpose in life!
<br>
<br>
Take care, and know you're in my thoughts!
