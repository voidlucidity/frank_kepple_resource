<section>
I was reading how Fz is a focus state that may be accoumpanied by a star-scape and had a few questions-
<br>
<br>
1) what do the stars usually mean or represent.
<br>
<br>
2) why is it that (for me at least) looking up at the stars causes me to experience an intensity that almost makes me want to wake up and scream from it. Not out of fear, just intensity.
<br>
<br>
3) One time I remembered that there were semi-transparent clouds that covered the starry sky. What does that usually mean too?
<br>
<br>
Thanx-

Hi:
<br>
<br>
In my case the 3D-Blackness at the Monroe Focus 21 state is punctuated by points of light that look like stars in the clear night sky. I am not sure what these points of light represent. I have gone up close to them on occasion and they just look like a point of light simply suspended in mid air. I am not sure whether they are a particular product of my imagination or what. Not everyone sees them, so it could be me providing a little Focus 2 infill to make the scene more interesting. After all, the 3D-Blackness is right on the "edge" of the Focus 2 state, before you trip over into Focus 3.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, the 3D-Blackness state, for me, has always been a transition state into Focus 3. It is not a state I have really any connection with. I do enjoy, now and again, just floating in the blackness. It got quite addictive a few years ago but once I discovered Focus 3 then I moved on and it became largely a transition state, as I say.
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean about the intensity. I feel that now with every Focus 4 experience I come across. I feel a little fear, not because I am scared, but it is the sheer awesomeness of the experience that gets you. You'd have to be totally brain-dead not to feel excitement or apprehension. And if you were so inclined you wouldn't be having these experiences in the first place. So it is something we all have to encompass at all stages in our experience.
<br>
<br>
The semi-transparent clouds in the foreground sound like a remnant from the prior Focus 12 state. As you proceed to the full Focus 21 experience these clouds should fall away to reveal the 3D Blackness in its entirety.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I've seen the starry sky only once with the clouds, the 5th time I should say.
<br>
<br>
And once I did get up close to a "star" kinda looked like a cheese ball with a plain blue plastic ball orbiting it. (whatever the hell that means)
<br>
<br>
I'd almost want to say that they are portals or energy points of some kind. And the more sensitve you get the more you see around them. But I'm not sure-
<br>
<br>
Nice to see I'm on a little on the cutting edge too.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Energy points, yeah, definitely but as to whether they are portals, hmm, next time I might try Phasing through one and see where it leads!

<section>
I'm going out on a limb here, the branch may well snap, but maybe these energy points represent other peoples consiousness, or at least like icons on a computer screen, if you can tell who is who, then you "click" on one of these and then obe to there location perhaps?
<br>
<br>
and the more sensitive you get, you start to see dimmer stars that represent those people whos energy level is either far away or just lower than others.
<br>
<br>
Purely speculative of course.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
No problems in speculating. I would never have got as "far" as I have if I didn't keep pitching myself in a speculative mode. I'll give your theory a try and see what comes about for me. Realise that Fz is right on the "border" of each person's individual consensus reality so the "stars" could mean differently for each person though it is likely there would be some similarities as I am sure you would expect.
<br>
<br>
As I say, I always saw Fz as more of a transitional state so there is no doubt a lot to discover just at Fz alone. It's just that at Fz I am always itching to make the transition to Focus 4 these days. I only manage it on about 3 tries in 10 attempts and even then it's not what I hoped for. I often end up just scratching the surface. But I'll get there before not too long.
<br>
<br>
Patience and persistence is the key to all of this, both for me and for everyone. Unless you happen to have been born with some kind of "gift" but these people are few and far between. Genuine ones I mean. For every genuine one there are probably a thousand fakes.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Maybe all the stars are simply portals created by the mind to various focuses or maybe they are there because when we look at pure blackness we usually associate it with the night sky and put stars into the blackness to get a sense of where we are within it. Â If there is nothing but blackness any normal person could go mad staring into it without anything to gauge travel.

<section>
sounds like the simpler explanation, but I've also been in 3d wooshing blackness and a few times I willingly went down down down until I had an AP.
<br>
<br>
weird huh?

<section>
Since we are speculating...
<br>
<br>
If we assume that all indeed is one (time, location and perception being only aspects of the whole) then could the stars not be other individuals entereing the 3D stage?
<br>
As some are more aware of the stage they perceive the stars, others do not or do to a lesser degree.
<br>
<br>
This is really going out on a limb but the idea strikes me as reasonable. In our normal, everyday focus of consciousness, we perceive people as physical individuals. In the 3D we could just as easily perceive others as dots of light.
<br>
We cannot enter the dot as the 3D is still indvidual and in other Fs the consciousness is more and more universal and common to all.
<br>
<br>
Just a thought, Y'see

<section>
from the 3-d blackness, how do you get to F3 and how do you know you are in a higher stage and not just another part of F2oC?

<section>
Just stay calm and will yourself to enter an F3 enviroment. Look for any small pin-pricks of light or shapes in the blackness and focus on them. They will begin to expand to form 'astral screens' featuring astral enviroments, (typically F3). Then simply enter them.
<br>
<br>
You can just try this and look for random locales or go looking for something specific.
<br>
<br>
Its up to you. The key is to stay calm and focused so you dont end up releasing emotional energy that ends up shooting you into a self created F2 enviroment. Providing you are relaxed, you should enter a F3 enviroment from the 3d blackness stage without too much trouble.
<br>
<br>
As for telling which is which, once you start interacting with the people in the locale, you will soon know if you are in F3 or not... these people will come across as quite real and will do or say things that you may not expect!

<section>
ok I can see how that would work, are there any differences in transportation of the vehicle in F3 as opposed to F2 (I know there it's all eternal, but it still appears that you have some other form in the astral).

<section>
Whatever 'vehicle' you want, it's up to you.
<br>
<br>
Typically you are in what appears to be a copy of your normal physical form.
<br>
<br>
However people experience different 'bodies' depending on what they are expecting; you generate whatever 'vehicle' feels comfortable for yourself.
<br>
<br>
I usually don't feel any different to when I'm physical, apart from the fact that I can do things like flying of course!
