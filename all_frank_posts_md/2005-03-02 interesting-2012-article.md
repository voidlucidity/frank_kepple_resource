Yeah but I don't think their articles are that hard to believe. The only other articles of theirs that I've seen that were unusual as far as news is concerned regarded UFOs and I found both of them relatively believable. Pravda on the other hand has some pretty out-there (poo-poo).

I looked 3 times and I could not find one piece of factual information in that article.
<br>
<br>
Aside, there is
<b>
 a lot
</b>
of controversy surrounding 2012. I think it is even more discussed than the year 2000. About every single bad thing that could happen to us will happen in 2012, apparently.

What exactly are you looking for? The problem I had with it was that I have no idea what data they used to come to the conclusions they did with their computer model, but I didn't want to dismiss the page outright by that alone. I guess the fact that they mentioned NASA actually commenting on the subject had some significance for me, as well, even if taken way out of context (and it may very well be).
<br>
<br>
I don't think 2012 is the end of the world or any date of demonic wars or etc., but it IS when the sun will be at a very particular and significant point within the galaxy, and the Mayans had this cycle pinned down to the day (and this is factual, as far as facts go). It held some spiritual significance for them, but I suppose exactly why is going to be revealed in time.
<br>
<br>
Here's a link I've posted before that explains the mathematics of the event:

<br>
<br>
I'm just interested in why the Mayans gave this event such attention in their culture, even when it was so far off.

please not '2012' and 'demon wars' again... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

PS For the 'demon war' brigade:  instead of reading suspect websites and dodgy manga inspired nonsense, people might want to check out the facts about the *actual* Mayan calender and then they will be sorely disapointed that there is in fact no 'demon wars' or 'apocalypses'.. in fact, yes it is the end of a particular cycle and the start of another one.. but the Mayan calender was full of such cycles and thats all it is.. a calender.. sorry guys to disapoint your apocalypse fantasies which you are all so desperate to believe!

I have a big problem with this 2012 nonsense. It's sounds, looks and feels like etheric unreal nonsense. I'm being blunt and honest here about my feelings on this one
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.  When I've seen it challenged elsewhere some proponents of this 2012 prediction/catastrophe/magnetic shift idiocy start to reduce it to a more "etheric" subtler shift of energies and suchlike. The kind of thing a cynic like me would not be able to notice.  There is a point where I feel an open mind can become a mind where things can fall out, oh like a bs detector perhaps
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.
<br>
It's late and I'm writing only exactly what I think without too much "PC" rubbish added on me thinks-so it's likely to be slightly offending sort of. Not intended, I'm only attacking perhaps a rather silly concept-yet another "doomsday" date for our diaries.  It's possible to find numerological, historical, scriptorial, mathamatical and other evidence for anytime you wish to pin hopes/fears on if you try hard enough. The brain is fantastic at finding these patterns.  Hence why I disbelieve it. It's wishful/fearful thinking at it's best/worst. G'night, over and out...

Whats worrying but typically human is that there are plenty people out there who are*desperate* for such 'end of the world' scenarios to be true, as they are so unhappy with aspects of their own lives that they wish more than anything for something to come along and shake things up.. apocalypses, demon wars, vibration changes and so on fit the bill.
<br>
<br>
The good news is, that radical change *can* come about, but that change comes from within, not without... change yourself, and you will find no more need of aplocalypse fantasies to see you through the day.

Damn. Griping after I explicitly said didn't think either demon wars OR the end of the world was going to occur.

I think we went through this before. Read the link. Dodgy sites my butt.

 This essay is not contrived upon sketchy evidence. It basically rests upon two facts:
 <br>
 <br>
 1) the well known end date of the 13-baktun cycle of the Mayan Long Count, which is December 21st, 2012 A.D. and
 <br>
 <br>
 2) the astronomical situation on that day. Based upon these two facts alone, the creators of the Long Count knew about and calculated the rate of precession over 2300 years ago. I can conceive of no other conclusion. To explain this away as "coincidence" would only obscure the issue.

hahahaha! This sounds so familiar within my group of friends LOL! I wonder how many people like this think it might be fun or interesting, but when/if it actually happens theyd turn into quivering terrified wrecks and would start wishing everything was nice and easy again

Perhaps I should have been more clear, in that I wasnt refering to you or your post, but rather to the more gullable types that may be attracted to your '2012' reference and then set off a new chain of 'demon war' twoddle which we all had to endure a while back, as i'm sure you remember!

You know, I cannot wait for 2012 to just come and go. But the problem is, there's just going to be another one and another, and another... ad nauseum. I'm betting odds-on for the "we got our dates wrong" excuse. In other words, the same tired old claptrap they trawl up every time. In a way I wish the world would end. At least it would be something different, and it would spare us from yet more of this drivel.
<br>
<br>
Something that made me chuckle the other day: I was reading a post on one of the religious sections where someone was pitching "end of world" evidence on the number of earthquakes. He went back to earthquake figures from the 1800's, which was a small figure, compared to the present day. Yeah, like we had seismographs all over the planet and monitoring satellites in the 1800's! LOL.
<br>
<br>
Whoops, just another little "fact" that gets overlooked in the march to armageddon. In 2011 I'm going to get a bumper-sticker made saying "You Can Go To Armaggon But I'm Staying In Bed... Yawn" :)

Ah, I thought you had misread something of mine. At any rate this post is yet to attract any such people - but just the opposite it seems.
