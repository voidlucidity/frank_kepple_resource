So, I'm trying to meditate. I meditate by lying down and slowly, very slowly, count to 100, and when I get there, count backwards. Anyway, when I get to around the 50's I start to hear tadbits of songs and static like a radio switching through stations. But, I was there and then I just started to not feel my body anymore. I started to get the vibrations! Or so I thought... Much to my dismay, it turned out an air plane was flying over head and the noise pulled me out of my meditation! Stupid airplane... Well, it's ok, anyway, a few minutes later my mom came in and disturbed my peace. But, I thought I was having the vibrations people talk about, but it was an airplane! How disappointing.

Hi Riso,
<br>
<br>
Where's your handle from? Is that from a movie? It sounds familiar.
<br>
<br>
If it's any consolation, there are also experiences that you will be absolutely convinced are
<i>
 physically
</i>
based - and when you check you will realize that they weren't physical at all! For a short period of time, in the mornings, I used to try to release my astral arms from my physical arms, and clasp my astral hands together to feel them. It felt so entirely mundane, the whole process - lying there, slowly raising my arms, then holding my hands together. Felt completely 'normal.'  Several times in disgust I said "This is so stupid. I know I'm just moving my physical arms" but when I opened my eyes I saw my physical arms lying peacefully on the bed. Once I even saw my 'etheric' arms - shimmery pink and really pretty, holding hands together.
<br>
<br>
So hang in there, keep it up, keep the faith, you'll get it.
<br>
<br>
And believe it or not, I'm still a skeptic. Sigh.
<br>
<br>
Patty

Risu, thats an unfortunate story !!! but funny none the less.
<br>
<br>
I've had the vibrations that people talk about quite a few times now. Its quite exciting to find that you have made a bit of progress....and it encourages you to keep trying.
<br>
<br>
Next time I get them...I'll check outside and make sure there are no low flying jets.

Uhh... No, Risu no Kairu is not from any movie, show or book, it's an original name. It means 'Kyle of the Squirrel.'
<br>
<br>
But that's not why I'm reviving this topic.I'm reviving it to keep from making another one.
<br>
<br>
What exactly do the vibrations feel like? I know they can have levels of intensity, but what do, say, really weak ones feel like? Do they feel like when you hum, only all over your body?
<br>
<br>
Last night, August 4, 2002, I wasn't doing anything, I was just moving energy around my body by visualizing a hand stirring the energy around. After I went all through my body,  it felt like my bed pushed me up (weird). Well, I kept on with the swirling the energy around and a few minutes it felt like I was shaking/vibrating/humming, only it was all over. It was just a slight feeling though. What do you think that was?

Hi Risu, the only ones I've had have been quite strong vibrations...i.e. you know you are not imagining it.
<br>
<br>
It feels like your body is reverbrating all over, very quickly, in a similar manner to how an engine vibrates. Although you are concious that these vibrations are going on, you are also concious that your physical body is perfectly still.

<section>
Risu,
<br>
<br>
As for me, I never have strong vibrations.  In fact, sometimes it simply feels like my body is numb all over, and I slip right out of it.  If I think about it, then I will feel a constant, steady vibration happening, but it's nothing violent like a car crash or anything.
<br>
<br>
I think it depends on the individual.  Some people have such a turbulent case of vibes that it freaks them out.  I have never had an unpleasant experience.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,

Somewhere there is a list of how many projectors experience which type of symptom. If you do a search for "Buhlman" and "OBE" (and it was a questionnaire type thing so you could add "questionnaire" or something) you might find it.
<br>
<br>
Vibrations occur for over half but not all projectors. Among those who have vibrations, they range wildly from a warm feeling to soul ripping jet engine things.

Hi!
<br>
<br>
My experience has been that the more I project, the less intense the vibrations become.  In the beginning, I felt like an off-balance washing machine during the spin cycle.  Now, it just feels like a buzz and a hum, but it's not an all over body-buzz.  Rather, it's like a head-and-chest buzz-and-hum.  If that makes any sense.
<br>
<br>
It comes after a very "wobbly" feeling.  Remember the first time you jumped off a diving board?  Were you nervous?  Do you remember the wobbly feeling you had during that split second before your feet actually left the board?  It feels kind of like that.
<br>
<br>
Now, when the wobbles start, instead of thinking OH BOY HERE I GO!  (which ruins the whole experience), I just think "uh-oh, I'd better flop now."  I very quickly release every tension and thought in my body/mind, and lie there all vacant and limp and expectant.
<br>
<br>
Of course, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't!

Hey Risu,
<br>
<br>
Everybody uses the word "vibrations" because that is the closest word to the actual feeling that we can come up with.  You have probably already felt them before you just weren't aware of them at the time.  For me sometimes it is as if a freight train is running through my head with energy running through my body.  Other times it is just a light hum.  But it is always a very heavy feeling in my head.  It is as if someone put a brick in my head and I can't lift it off my pillow because it is too heavy.
<br>
<br>
Quite the interest in Japanese.  Gambatte ne!

Please, call me Kairu.
<br>
<br>
Anway, about the radio noises. I was trying to meditate today, (Saturday, June 21, 2003). I was sitting on the sofa. Needless to say, I fell asleep.
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
But as I was falling asleep, trying to keep my mind up, I started to hear the radio again! Actual songs playing! In fact, one song sounded so loud and real I thought I forgot to turn the radio off, bolted up, and it faded away! Confused me for a minute.
<br>
<br>
And as I kept going in and out of sleeping while trying to remain aware, I kept hearing music!
<br>
<br>
Now, does anyone know what causes this? Maybe it's the  brain playing back a memory of the song?
<br>
<br>
I was tired, so I didn't exactly get up, and turn on the radio to find out if that song was playing. :\

Kairu: Yes, it is a little surprising on first hearing music.
<br>
<br>
I think I've posted before on this where, when it first happened, it was so startling I was immediately zapped back to C1. Next there was me, traipsing from room to room looking to see if a radio or TV could have been switched on. I even went outside to check if any neighbours were having a party or something!
<br>
<br>
Once I got used to the idea, I went through a phase of floating in the 3D-Blackness at the Focus 21 stage while listening to some favourite classical pieces. I don't do it so much now because it was getting rather addictive and taking up too much projection time.
<br>
<br>
Within non-physical realms, people listen to music just a we do within the Physical. There is no need for any kind of radio receiver. All a person needs to do is develop the mental knack of tuning into it. At first I too thought it was just my mind replaying memories of music I had heard in the past. Thinking that I guess is only natural.
<br>
<br>
Then I started to tune-in to music I had never heard before. Radio stations, for example, that I had never heard of. Which does feel a bit weird at first. But after a while you just accept it as normal.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Frank and Lord of the Squirrel,
<br>
<br>
Ever since I childhood I've gone through phases when I will hop in to bed, turn off the light and immediately hear the radio stations. I've never been able to figure out what it was because it would start before I was feeling drowsy. It sounds like radio static and people talking all at once, and sometimes, music that sounds familiar but isn't really. Even though it's happened so many times, I frequently get up to make sure the radio alarm hasn't gone off at the wrong time. The same sort of thing happens to other people I know, and we've never been able to figure it out. My speculation has been that it's related to the noise of human thought and creativity.
<br>
<br>
It also sometimes happens when I'm wide awake, oddly enough. I hear music and people talking. I also had extremely frequent and involuntary out of body experiences and sort of "remote eye projections" while I was idly sitting at work or even waiting in line at the store. I used to think I was crazy, then I was diagnosed with narcolepsy (which is made of four main symptoms: excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hynogogic hallucinations.) The doctor speculated that I was half falling asleep all the time, and that's why I experienced some of this stuff. (I didn't tell him everything--can't trust those doctors to understand!) I've got control of my symptoms by now (many years later) through energy work and a sort of biofeedback I made for myself. It would be great to know for sure someday the cause of the radio sounds and voices.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for describing your experiences, guys, and nice to meet you.
<br>
Laurel

LOL, the first time I heard the beautiful musical composition in sleep paralysis state I thought it was the work of the devil, trying to entice me...
<br>
<br>
That was years ago. It's not that fearful now.
