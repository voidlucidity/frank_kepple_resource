I  have been having extreme difficulty using Robert's NEW Technique for stimulating my energy body. I am an extremely visual person and I literally have to visualize my hands doing the touching to get any sensation. I can shift points of awareness around my body quite easily, but putting motion to them via a tactile sensation is another story. This has been very difficult and frustrating for me as I can't seem to replicate touch in my mind as well as I can imagery. I would appreciate if anyone has any suggestions for doing this.

<br>
That's exactly the point.

Never tried the NEW system as my origins are more Monroe school. But the thought came to mind when I saw your post, why not ask the man who published it, Bob Bruce? Pop a question in his private section and I'm sure he'll oblige.

I had the same problem as you mention when I had just started NEW. I'm a very visually oriented person too. And since we depend on visual feedback more than other faculties, it's not unusual that another faculty, in this case the tactile, is less useful to us or even somewhat dormant.
<br>
<br>
That's how it appeared to me, so I just hung in there and practiced even more until I had built up a greater momentum of mastery over this faculty. It was well worth the effort.
<br>
<br>
Can you feel the prana energy tingling your feet and hands and can you feel the bubbling/rushing sensations in your limbs when you practice? Don't get too hung up on the exercises themselves--they are a means to an end. Almost everyone, myself included, would tell you that after a few months of practice you gain the ability to move the energy purely as an act of will--much as you would lift your arm or take a breath. It's not exactly tactile or visual; you just do it. The exercises will get you there the quickest though.
<br>
<br>
Once again I have to say that the effort and inconvenience to learn this is well worth it. I don't have to spend any time at all doing energy gathering now. What I mean by that is that I do it while watching TV or sitting in boring meetings at work, etc. It definitely helps to have concentrated, dedicated times each day for practice in the beginning though.
<br>
<br>
Good luck!! I hope this helps. Just keep after it and reread the instructions once in a while. It will help.

I think he mentions in AD that NEW is harder for people who have good visualization skills.  I lucked out in that I have pretty good visual, touch and hearing, and weak smell and taste sensualization skills.  So I was able to manage it pretty easily.  I'm with boydster, though.  These exercises gave me responses faster than any regular visualization program had before.  I recommend you try to keep it up!  Also, try taking Frank's advice and asking him if he has any suggestions!

I'm not the only one =D.  My sense of smell and visualization are very powerful (above average I'd say) and I too am having a hard time with this tactic.  Something which I found worked a bit more is the "yoyo" technique Bruce describes.  In short, you push your consciousness forward and backward in a yoyo fashion.  I think I read that in the tutorials sections.

I'm having a tad bit of trouble too. I kept looking at my hand from palm to fingertips in the newbie exercises trying to picture my hand there... but that bridges on visualization
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I found it sort of helped me pinpoint what I could actually FEEL when I looked away from the hand that I was trying to stimulate the touch in, or closed my eyes, whatever.

Hey guys!
<br>
<br>
Having trouble with the NEW system?  Well, as a bad visualizer, I can't speak through your experience, but...
<br>
<br>
Tyciol has got it right.  You have to feel the area in your mind to move the energy around.
<br>
<br>
If it's hard, try physically rubbing from finger to wrist, finger to wrist, until you have the experience fresh in your mind.
<br>
<br>
Now, "feel" the same area in your mind.  Just keep switching, and you'll train yourself to "feel" with your mind in no time, all over the body.
<br>
<br>

I thought it was wrist to fingers.

From the NEW guide:
<br>
<br>
"To start with I suggest tracing a pathway **from the base of your left thumb, along the sensitive inside of your arm and on up to your left shoulder.** Close your eyes and concentrate on the feel of the brush or fingers touching and moving along the surface of your skin. Ignore the hand doing the brushing and concentrate solely on its touch. Repeatedly stroke this pathway, from **thumb to shoulder** and back to your thumb again, following this with your body awareness until you have a good feel for the action."
<br>
<br>
"Using a large sponging action, move awareness through whole of left hand, **from fingertips to a few inches above wrist, back and forth,** feeling whole of hand."
<br>
<br>
The energy transfer is from fingers and hands, the energy receptors, to the belly, chest and forehead, energy containers.  However, at the beginning stages, back and forth helps to stimulate the area's energy pathways, so either direction is OK for training, but the direction for energy storage is hand to wrist and beyond.
<br>

I have practicing more and more and I am able to feel my energy to some degree using the exercises. I understand now that my real goal is actually drawing up energy into my primary energy circuits. Still though, I still haven't quite got the feeling for NEW yet. I guess for visual people like me, it requires twice as much practice.

Advanced visualisation skills are just  half side of the one coin.
<br>
Have you the ability to FADE your visualisation to void?
<br>
If you can visualize your body parts, fade them to void afterway, you simply get the good feeling of your energy body and get lighter and lighter, if you get attached to energy trough visualization.
<br>
You can rob your hands until they get warm, move them together, not touching, feel the thin/fat energy film of your hands.Notice your feeling(general mood for that moment= and compare it to your energy film)
<br>
You need no viz or closed eyes to do this.
<br>
<br>
As you get used on it, you can try to expand your energy body to the volume of the room (feel the end-corners of the room)and shrink back to body again.
<br>
Practices on this have good benifits on psi-skills.
