Hi to all the projectors in this forum.
<br>
I kinda need help about my last projection that made me a great shock and I have the trauma until now.
<br>
<br>
It was at the night, I was furious for some perssonal reasons. Then I got a shock of bad energy in my whole body and I started to just think about hurting someone, Then I went to bed to Astral project and then something wierd happened: I already was in a deep trance, then I started to look through my closed eyes and then I saw exactly my face with green opened green eyes smiling a diabolic smile, I was terrified! I didn't know what to do I just looked exactly into his eyes and then I felt a gusbumps and I tried to get out of the trance but I was already paralyzed and it seemed like it attacked me with no reason and without moving from its place.. I don't think it was the projected double cuz I know my projected double.. this was an evil form..
<br>
Does someone here know what it is?

Hi M-I,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the shook up club [

I think you have given yourself your own answer! If not already done please read the Waking Paralysis section of the Treatise On OOBE
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/guides/oobe/oobe_8.htm#1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astralpulse.com/guides/oobe/oobe_8.htm#1
</a>
or check out Paralysis and the projected double in Astral Dynamics if you have a copy.
<br>
<br>
One of the 1st times I had a sleep paralysis feedback loop with the projected double the living be-Jesus was scared out of me! So I really do respect how you may be feeling!
<br>
<br>
In my case I felt as if I was beset by an ominous black amorphous shape flying around the room trying to get into me or at me. At the same time I was totally frozen and was feeling an extreme sense of dread. When I was eventually able to move around I felt very unsteady on my feet and still not at ease at all.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly I had a sleep paralysis event about 4 weeks ago. Although this time I still felt the dis-ease, I found that by recognising what had occurred fair and square I was able to steady my nerves much more quickly!
<br>
<br>
Please be comforted that the 'shook up' feeling will dissipate over a few hours if not over the day ahead. Perhaps go for a refreshing walk to enable you to let it go and ground yourself! There is absolutely no need to worry about it to be honest!
<br>
<br>
Kind wishes,
<br>
<br>
<br>

<section>
Thanks for the long and interesting answer but I wasn't talking on my paralysis! I was talking about that face of me that I saw... I wanted to leave the projection and quit it cuz I was afraid but I couldn't move because of the paralysis... Then I just made the exit and I saw that my Astral body was kinda grey "dirty" then I lost concentration and woke up in my normal body... any Ideas??

When people get furious and start to think about hurting others they create evil thought-forms in their mind, and these thought forms actually come to life within the lower astral. So people who do this, what tends to happen is, when they project they meet their own thought-form energies head on. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. If you sort out the mental problems you are having I'm sure it'll all just fizzle away.
<br>

It was exactly what I tought it was!
<br>
<br>
I was thinking about my evil projected double as one of my Astral bodies.
<br>
<br>
When I understood that when I feel a negative feeling then my energy changes its properties and becomes negative so my Astral body could be evil too.
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot!

if I understood this correctly, this is the perfect example of th euniversal rule by the name ;" you get what you give". Negative intentions (like the good things you do)come back to you sooner or later. What I noticed is that the more you are spiritually developed the quicker you see the outcome of your

<br>
Also I think that you should not attempt astral projection when you are in a negative mood, because like Frank said, you will attract the same.
<br>
good luck.

I went thro a very bad patch once where thro medication and excess drinking, negativity and deep depression! I found to my horror this dark brown oily creature that had been formed, I took great strength and curage to face it head on, its gone now thank fully.
<br>
<br>
Thro my spiritual stuidies thought is very real, and i agree with the above posts!
<br>
<br>
I remember once looking at myself lying on the bed, when a darker vesion of me sat up and grinned, scared the hell out of me, i shot out of my body in full C, then i felt something tickling my legs like water as i looked around i could see my legs floating thro the bath room wall!
<br>
<br>
I have had two genuine neg attacks in the last six months whilst out my body, I am trying to train myself to be firm with them as Robert says in his Psychic Defence book, there realy isnt much they can do to you, our pure spirit cant be harmed!
<br>
<br>
One word! Keep cool brother lol[

The thing that caught my attention was the green eyes.
<br>
<br>
Was it like normal green eyes?  "Oh, he has the prettiest green eyes!"
<br>
<br>
Or like gowing green eyes?
<br>
<br>
I was reading one of Robert's replies to the post of a person who kept seeing green (they may have actually been blue) eyes during OBEs.  Either way, there seems to be something significant about strange eye color, or maybe just psychologically significant.
