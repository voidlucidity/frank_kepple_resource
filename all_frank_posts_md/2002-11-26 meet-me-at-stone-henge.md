<section>
I dont know if this has been tried before but I was thinking why cant we arrange meetings and then post the results on this forum? I know that there is the problem of projections being unreliable but let me suggest this to you all.
<br>
<br>
If anyone gets out of their body from now on go to stonehenge in England and at least then after a few months someone will hopefully meet up with someone. If you've never been there before then if you get out and make it there come on the forum and describe to everyone what you saw and hopefully we can corroberate! any meetings, seeing anyone from fourm or elsewhere then post it on here!
<br>
<br>
i think this should be a locked topic and we should really have a go at this. so anyone who's going out tonight have a go and report back here!!
<br>
<br>
<br>
sorry but I'm dead excitied this is a good idea man!!

<section>
oh yeah, those of us who cant have obes or the likes can try to indue lucid dreams! eg try to imagine before you got to sleep that you are traveling to england/stonehenge then if you dream about it tell us on the forum, what it looked like etc.

Mr. Bruce writes of this in AD. Most people who "succeed" in going to a meeting place report incorrect details. THis doesn't mean that they failed, but that it might not be as straightforward as you imagine.....
<br>
<br>
I haven't projected in a while, but I'll try to dream about stonehenge tonite for kicks.

<section>
Well, I dreamed very well last night. I couldn't remember anything. As usual I remember dreaming alot and there is light where I dream. The dreams are so close and I want to remember. I've never recalled a dream of anything or anywhere of anything I wanted or intended. I remember about 7-10 dreams a month, more if I include visualization or going lucid. I'm not that familiar with Stonehenge. All I could visualize before going to sleep was a couple of big bolders.I visualized someone there but can't remember that part.
<br>
<br>
I don't recall outdoor scenes as well as indoor. Maybe you can pick a place inside with a well known window in it ( a picture I can see of this room and a window).
<br>
I do better if I can align my window (physical) to where I want to go.
<br>
<br>
This is interesting and worth exploring.

<section>
NO dreams about stonehenge for me last night. Sorry.
<br>
<br>
THere's nothing wrong with Stonehenge or any other landmark. No one landmark is better or worse than another. But I think that it is not that you actually go to the physical location ----- maybe people end up at an astral version of the place or soemthing, and details vary from person to person and from one time to the next.

The choices are good. Here are a couple of links to the St. Louis (Missouri) the Arch. I've been up in this building, I can get a feel for it (small enclosed and small square windows to look out (both sides). This link shows the view from one of the windows (at bottom of the page of this link ). I couldn't find an indoor picture but I can remember the close quarters.

If there are better pictures at a landmark more familiar to all, I would give that a try too. What ya think?  Or, try Stonehenge again?  I'll check out some pictures.

I've never been to stonehenge before, this could be fun!  Just watch out for all those mystical vibrations .....look out MV to your left, and you hit the dirt or fly out of the way.
<br>
<br>
Even if it ended up being an astral version of stonehenge,  the objective is to go to a place at will and try to meet eachother there.  So I say lets go for it anyway.

Hi,
<br>
I tried this last night. Id just like to point out that I have never been to stone henge.
<br>
<br>
All I can remember is a round pile of stones, like a doorway. It was situated on a hill which was lushious green with grass. It was dark, about midnight.
<br>
<br>
Is this what stonehenge looks like?
<br>
<br>
Cya,

Next day
<br>
<br>
Before going to sleep I tried visualizing Stonehenge. This image came into my mind. A round white circle, on this white circle are animal and/or human figures (blurry).On the upper part of the circle is a bear (bigger in proportion to the rest of the figures). The center of the circle is what looks like an igloo with a door (blurry door).

Well, I tried a couple of times and managed to fly down  an expanse of short (cut?) grass for a second or two.  I  didn't see any stone pillars though.
<br>
<br>
Wisp,
<br>
What an interesting vision,  I loved seeing the animals when you discribed them.  It reminded me of a scene I read in the Hobbit by Tolkien.  The dwarves and one hobbit where staying the night at a animal friends house ,a giant bear, and were warned to stay inside the house all night long.  They were very curious about why.  In the middle of the night, some of the fellow friends woke up to hear the sound of many bears, a giant bear party was underway. Can you imagine seeing a ton of bears ouside dancing under the full moon around a huge fire?
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to share that bit of story.

Best Wishes,

Windameir--Tolkien is great! My husband has read the whole series and loved it so much he kept hinting I should read them.  I finally agreed and have loved every minute of it.
<br>
<br>
Sure, I wish we can go grab a friend and go for a nice fly.  Why...oh....why can't this be possible, it would be so much nicer to team up with a friend.
<br>
<br>
Here is the famous poem about Strider from the second book (I couldn't resist posting it)
<br>
<br>
All that is gold does not glitter,
<br>
Not all those who wander are lost;
<br>
The old that is strong does not wither,
<br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
<br>
<br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken.
<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring;
<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
<br>
The crownless again shall be king.

<section>
Leyla,
<br>
I found your post most interesting. Finding the card your roommate hid and all. Just 2 days prior to thanksgiving I saw the card sitting face up on a shelf near the ceiling of the room which my roommate had put there. This was supposed to 'validate' something or at least bring an end to the 4 month long debate between the Astral projection is real vs the b*llsh*t debate between the two factions of my friends. However, after 4 months of trying
<br>
finally succeeding was enormously satisfying, (including several projections where I got sidetracked before looking at the card) ultimately the nonbelievers have since devised about 20 different tests for me to perform
<br>
that would "REALLY" prove it. HA! What a waste of time. This brings up an interesting question though, for several months I had a goal, one which in many ways helped me to get out, but preoccupied my time while exploring
<br>
'non-physical reality' I'm curious what some other people who project have as a goal when they are out. Meeting at stonehenge sounds great for those great britain residents who may have been there, but for those of us who haven't I can only imagine a whole lot of mentally fabricated stonehenge visits that are created from our imaginations. I've heard of people meeting their guides which I haven't done yet, and is next on my agenda. RB suits up and deals with negs which sounds intriguing. What do you guys do on any given trip to the RTZ? When you shoot out and fly across the room to get away from your body (still working on my TMI phasing routine from frank's wonderful posts) is that as good a place to call for your guide as any? ...And on that note, what does one really "think/say" across the astral to summon the guide? Right now I'm thinking "Hello, could my guide come here please?"
<br>
These are just some of the things floating around in my head. Any suggestions are appreciated before I find myself bewildered and wondering what the girl next door wears to bed although perhaps that could be another test my friends would devise. Thanks for your help, and I have to say I look forward to reading these message boards before I project, I find it helps me get into the right frame of mind. Thanks everyone.

Hi all,
<br>
I used Stonehenge as the intent for one of my exercises the other day.I briefly found myself in a vast empty space with stone pillars rising in the distance,but I had the impression that I was indoors- more like one of those huge european cathedrals. It was a short event but still very cool! Having a target in mind helps my astral sight kick in,and actually meeting someone would be great fun. I`ll be looking for you...

I tried again to visualize Stonehenge. Again I got the white circle.This time the white circle is a huge moon above the site. I'm located way down at the ground level (almost as if I was part of the ground). The stones there were seen from this point of view. The stones were so tall and as if reaching toward the big moon. Then my point of view changed to being an onlooker.I can see Stonehenge under the large bright white moon. There's a howling wolf sitting in the middle of this site.
<br>
Is Stonehenge in a country setting? Is there alot of wild life there?

<section>
ummmmmm . . . and here I go putting a spoke in the works.
<br>
<br>
Some of you are operating from what might be a mistaken assumption; ie., that there is only one Stonehenge for you to go to.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, on the Astral there are an infinite number of Stonehenges, and you could end up at any of them.
<br>
<br>
And the chances of you all meeting at the same one . . . . ?  Without a strong emotional/physical/spiritual connection to one another, your chances are probably about . . . . ?
<br>
<br>
I have friends who do this.  Not at Stonehenge, but another stone circle in the U.S.  However, they've been working closely for 20+ years, raised each other's children, pray together, some of them live together, etc.
<br>
<br>
Sooooo . . . the moral of my story is . . . if you yearn to meet folks you know in the earthly realm on the Astral, then, by all means start your work in the physical realm with your soul mates who also OBE.  It can be done!

<section>
i have to echo Tisha's thoughts here....
<br>
<br>
the only feasible way for everyone to meet at stone henge would involve all the interested parties having a very strong emotional link with one person who would be a common factor....
<br>
<br>
Then that one person would wait physically at stone henge and everyone else could home in on their "signal". This would be a tricky exercise to organise !!!!

<section>
I'm not discouraged the least bit. I'm continuing my trip. I don't think any of the factors mentioned should necessarily matter. I've already accomplished something here I hadn't been able to do before (going somewhere I wanted).
<br>
I'm very enthused. I looked up about wolves (since I saw one at the destination). I already knew animals mean "instinctual". The wolfe was howling at the site. This book said wolves howl for several reasons, one being to gather it's pack together. This is a good sign for me. Symbolically this could be a heralding of the gathering we're going for.
<br>
<br>
I think anything is possible!

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
Another point about this. Since everyone is so far from each other it would be a reasonable intent to meet through the astral. The meeting would seem less likely to happen (for comparison sake only) if you can just walk or drive, or just turn to talk to them for that matter. The natural order of things and all in the physical and/or in the astral (may even find out more on this alone).  Just my own point of view.

<section>
Greetings,
<br>
<br>
I have been quickly reading  this chain of posts.
<br>
Let me help you a bit here.
<br>
<br>
For you to meet astraly, it is not as simple as to imagine to be in a certain place and go there.
<br>
Things aren't that way.
<br>
Two cenarios might happen:
<br>
You would, more likely,  project to a "created reality", or even if you succeed to go there, the chances of meeting someone at the time you want to would be small.
<br>
<br>
This because to reach to a physical place, I mean, in the physical realm, you must knwo how to go there physically, i.e. know the way there, even if flying, or at least use a direct portal to go there, what will create some type of astral coordinates that will direct you to a certain place.
<br>
That is essential to get orientation in the astral plane.
<br>
<br>
I would like to remind you that the coordinates in the astral plane are not three, but four, remember the Chronos coordinate: Time.
<br>
<br>
Even if two  of you go to a physical place at the same physical hour, that doesn't mean that you will be there astraly at the same time, for time is changeable there.
<br>
You can leap to the future (even if just one hour ahead) or to the past.
<br>
<br>
Then even in the real time zone you have three astral subplanes.
<br>
<br>
The astral meeting experiences for beginners must be done according to certain rules that will gradualy aproximate the possibility of success.
<br>
<br>
Finding a physical place is not hard, and stonehenge can be an idea, though, as it is an energetic vortex and it has many mental phenomena and associations with it (due to many cults, and ideias people have on that place), that will create a lot of astral distractions difficult to distinguish, of what is just a mental impression and an astral reality, and control by unexperimented practitioners will be difficult.
<br>
The symbolic manifestations would surely distract the beginner and would capture his conscience. As beginners always haven't much energy in the astral projection, they would spend it in that (reading symbols) instead of obtaining the goal of a meeting.
<br>
So, a simpler place is easier, but if you want my opinion, the creation of an Astral Locus would be the best. I would advise you to ask the help of one experienced person to do that.
<br>
Because of my duties with the Hermetic Fraternity I don't dispose the time, at the moment, to help you in this, nevertheless, I can indicate you some astral temples you may want to visit and meet there.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If, you want to start an experience like that by your own, you must learn a lot first.
<br>
I am just saying this to you to help, not to criticise.  Your experience is valid, but for you to succeed, you need to know more than the basics to do it.
<br>
<br>
I have met with Robert in the Astral Plane several times, in the present and in the past. I was one of the Astral Knights in the Laurellae experience, as Robert may testify you. So, take my word seriously and avoid a lot of disappointments.
<br>
<br>
Those interested in knowing more on this should go to
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.abardoncompanion.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.abardoncompanion.com
</a>
and read the Beneath an Astral Moon, experience.
<br>
There you will learn how to do this astral meetings.
<br>
Nevertheless, though they are fascinating, they also need a lot of commitment and practice.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My best to you all
<br>

<section>
Romero Cunha, Thank you so much for your contribution to this endeavor.
<br>
The site you gave is excellent. I've been there three or four times already, and I plan to learn all I can there. I'm even more interested in this subject now that I have read the details involved.
<br>
Your offer of an astral temple is so kind. How does one go about finding it?
<br>
I assume this is an Astral Locus which has already been established. I'm already learning that an established one would surely be easier for a beginner than having to create one. Is my thinking along the right lines?
<br>
I'm going to also start developing my astral locale. I'm still not clear how or what to do there yet, but I plan to cover the material more at the link you gave.
<br>
I want to further my personal journey on this subject matter. Thank you for opening a new door for me.
<br>
<br>
About stonehenge, depending what the others want about the alternative location, I guess would be up to the group. The feather focus mentioned in the Beneath the Astral Moon might be a good addition if all chooses to carry on with the Stonehenge meeting.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to seek the astral temple and Stonehenge at the same time (not simutaneously)? Or is it best to focus on one project at a time?
<br>
<br>

Dear friend,
<br>
In that same site I recommended you form Rawn, a friend of mine, you have there a text called Eight Temple meditation project. There is a downloadavle version too. There you will find portals to go to Astral temples.
<br>
Rawn is an Advenaced Magician and if you want some help from him, just let me know and I will chat withi him about it.
<br>
<br>
My best to you,

it doesnt really matter if it isnt possible for everyone to meet. just trying to has motivated everyone and given us a goal to try to reach. a number of people have even had good results.

<section>
Synapse, I agree with you, as long as it takes. Just before falling asleep a couple days ago I thought *Stonehenge*, I had a quick white flash of it. That tells me it is registered in my (higher?) consciousness. This has been a good experience for me.
<br>
<br>
Lysear, thank you for thinking of this and suggesting it on in this forum.
<br>
<br>
Romero, I've been visiting and learning about the Eight Temple meditation project. It's been quite the eye opener for me. It's brought to me the sense of order of thought (not sure if that the right way to say it). I'm sticking with the learning process there. I've never been one to understand or perform meditation practice. This site is easy to learn and follow. Your friend Rawn must be a genius! In the recent past I've looked over a little bit about the subject of the Qabbalistic Tree of Life (a varied form in another book), I felt it connected with The Truth. The web site, A Bardon Companion ,as well as here at Astral Pulse of course has been just what I needed to connect how I think, and then to be able to connect to other established thinking patterns. It's hard to explain really.
<br>
I looking forward to getting into the meditation part of the astral temple.  Just thought I would follow up with you on this.

The notion of meeting up at a pre-determined place is tantilizing.  And while we all presumably know what Stonehenge is, I wonder if it elicits the emotional
<i>
</i>
pull
<i>
</i>
necessary to draw everyone to it.  Some OBE writers say that one can be more easily drawn toward a person than a place.  (I don't agree with that necessarily, since I tend to be more drawn to places than people in full waking consciousness!)  Nonetheless, this tendency to "pull" toward people rather than places could be a problem for people who attempt to "go" to Stonehenge.

<section>
Interesting point Do. My tendency is toward location. I hadn't even thought about the alternative(other than the original goal of the project). In my daily life I find I get a sense of places in my past sometimes, like a building I was in years before. I'm not aware of such a connection with people in this same way. A couple of my family members say that they can sense (by smell) the individual smell of people (other family members anyway). I have never experienced this.
