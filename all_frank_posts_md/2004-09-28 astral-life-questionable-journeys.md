<section>
I have a friend that is in constant commication and sees many, many beings on the astral and seems to have a grasp of the overall 'story' of what is happening out there.  Much of what she has learned about these spirits is that they have been greatly mislead by one major player.  She knows many of the famous spirits that have been written about for ages.  I am about the only one she tells anything about these experiences with and now many of these beings don't want the word to get out about all that is happening 'out there' so they are trying to get rid of her now and she has been drained of much of her spiritual energies and chakras.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if anyone out there can confirm any of this or otherwise know of what is really happening with the 'big picture' out there.

This sounds interesting but it's hard to really say without more details. Exactly what have these spirits been misled about?

Is your friend aware of how infinite these realms are? I mean, they truly are infinite to the extent where there must be an infinite number of "overall stories" and such like.
<br>
<br>
What I feel is happened to your friend is she became attuned to a particular area, at a guess I'd say somewhere around the Monroe Focus 24 state, where the inhabitants believe in xyz scenario which subsequently became relayed to her. Then she took this knowledge as being generally applicable. Which it most certainly isn't, I am happy to confirm.

<section>
Can anyone out there actually 'go' to her and see what's happening around her and possibly tell her or me the real story, if this is just some kind of illusion. She is able to 'see' chakras and such and can see that her heart chakra has been taken and is not there anymore.
<br>
<br>
I can actually feel her energy and can feel it being drained or rebuilt when these things happen.  The main attacker is her former spiritual teacher, now passed over, who apparently became so powerful and turned 'bad'.  I can give someone his name privately if they really want to delve into this.  I know I have been personally attacked a number of times just as I dozed off to sleep and also in the dream state.  I have found that this 'guy' can alter or take me into different dream scenarios, trying to either get rid of me or scare or disturb my mind.
<br>
<br>
According to her he can implant people with negative thought forms or astral constructions designed to weaken or slow people down and there is also supposed to be, according to her, a big scam going on to steal or siphon off people's higher energies, all led by this one main character.  He is also apparently good at hiding or masking his methods and quite elusive.

<section>
I have also learned how to deal with this guy pretty well now and see how he works.  I have found that not being afraid or intimidated or struggling with his ideas or energy or illusions is the best defense.  He uses our own thoughts and beliefs against us by distorting them or twisting them and seems to be focusing his efforts particularly on the ones who may be able to stop him.
<br>
<br>
I have learned that he has convinced or brainwashed many of the spirits on the other side to engage in sexual behavior or attacks on many women here on Earth to degrade their energies or 'steal' people's life force or higher energies.
<br>
<br>
There is much more to tell and I am still learning more every day.  I hope this is all some kind of illusion or fantasy but for now I am dealing with this stuff every day and night and have a good handle on it, I think.

Techno.,
<br>
<br>
Actually he did appear somewhat like that to me once, but he was pretty tall and husky as well.  Also his eyes were a wild-eyed light blue.  He reminded me of a big baby with extraordinary power.
<br>
<br>
I think he changes often and may look different now.
<br>
<br>
Runlola,
<br>
<br>
I will hold off on his name for now, as this guy is not someone you may want to get tangled up with.  I have heard that he has 'taken out' a number of people here on Earth since his passing in the late 1990's.  After more experiences with him and I get a better handle on the situation I may release his name.
<br>
<br>
AstralSpinner,

Thanks for the pointer[

Yes, this is definitely lower astral stuff and is typical of all the kinds of mind games that are played out within these realms. Big inflated egos trying to wield power over others. They do it while physical and simply continue within the lower realms of the astral. They have no real power over anyone, except for what the person in question gives them. I often get confronted by these characters on my tours of the lower realms. The solution is just to walk right through them as if they weren't there. This fuses their circuits no end.

<section>
I would add that to my knowledge there is no way that your heart chakra can be 'removed' or indeed any other part of your energy system. Your energy system is an integral part of your physical body and its link to the mind etc.
<br>
Whats happening is that this character *convinces* you that all these nasty things have happened and if you believe it then that is how it will appear. It's all mind games, which are not confined to the astral but are frequently carried out here as well.
<br>
Most cults work in the same way in fact. 'you are not worthy' etc, There are many ways of getting a handle over someone.
<br>
<br>
Tell you friend that she has to see the situation for the sham it is, and while you're at it, you might want to tell yourself that too, as it seems you are being drawn into it.
<br>
<br>
I find it feasable that this individual can influence you since 'like + like', and I feel that this can cross boundaries ie people stuck in an emotional loop here may find themselves under the influence of like minded people over in the astral, as despite being 'physical' they are all on the same wavelength as it were.
<br>
However, you should'nt overestimate their degree of power. They only have power over you as long as you let them.

<section>
OK, since you guys seem to think this is no big deal, here's a website with this guy's life works:
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.tsgfoundation.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.tsgfoundation.org
</a>
<br>
<br>
Also I might mention that I'm pretty sure this guy can also materialize into a physical form, as I think I had a run-in with him at the local library one day as he tried to convince me that my whole life and everyone else's on the planet were worthless.  I could feel his overbearing presense and mental pressure and that just happened to be the day I was feeling the worst or 'low' in this whole past year.  This encounter took place in the public restroom as he caught me 'off guard' somewhat.
<br>
<br>
Anyone else out there know anything about spirits beings able to materialize into the physical after passing.  I don't think we should all assume this is just a small affair, as you'll see by his site that he is not your usual character.
<br>
<br>
Please let me know what you find out all, OK?(privately, if you want)...and maybe some of us can settle this matter together.
<br>
<br>
All be well...[

<section>
Interesting, in the past i would have discounted the idea of anyone from the astral having the resources or power to materialise a body for themselves in the physical, but from my research into seance room phenomena, materialisation of physical objects does indeed seem to be possible. therefor, I guess if you take the idea to its logical conclusion, it might be possible in an extreme case to generate a physical body of some kind, at least for a short time, although how the individual is able to achieve this is a puzzle to me.
<br>
<br>
The way i see it, the only way that might be possible is if people 'lend' him the energy.. I'm not sure if this is feasable or not... why not carry a camera around with you and see if you can get a shot of him!
<br>
<br>
I still feel that if you lose you fear of him he will lose any power over you that he may have, although I realise that this might be easy to say, but harder to do.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
PS I went to their site and the founder seems like an ok sort of bloke, typical 'spiritual teacher' type, even if i dont agree with all his ideas. I find it hard to believe that he's responsible for what you describe.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps more likely it is someone ELSE purporting to be him, just to mess with your head, which is a major area of enjoyment for some people.

<section>
Gandalf,
<br>
<br>
Actually I'm not afraid of this guy anymore, as I've figured out how to handle his methods for the most part.  The main one I'm still working on is his ability to make me go through any particular dream contruction of his making, although I see that he gets his ideas for them from my subconscious mind.  This guy is a step above what you may think, or maybe a few steps.  According to my friend, who is really being messed with by him, and others; he is the main one behind the main brainwashing taking place on the astral and into the physical.  She is quite advanced and can see his implants in people and easily remove them, (I believe this is the main reason why he is so 'on her' all the time).
<br>
<br>
As far as materializing, he is probably using all the 'stolen' energies he gets from others and my friend says materializing can last for 3 days at most.
<br>
<br>
Do not underestimate this guy...If you look deeper into his works or his eyes you may find that he is very tricky indeed.  I can tell by his photo on the site that he would be a 'dark sider'.  It really makes sense that this really is him indeed, at least to me.  My friend was a student of his this past life and has found that he has been after her for many lifetimes as well...The story gets thicker.
<br>
<br>
All be well...

I chuckled as soon as I saw the link: something-foundation dot org. And I said to myself, yep, thought so. And then, sure enough, up comes ubiquitous funny logo, man with beard, mission statement, pathway to this, that and the other, oh and a battling dark forces book. IMO, a complete joke. How can these people possibly have any power over anyone?
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there are certain types of people who believe in it. And so (for them) it becomes. I never understood why people believe that kind of stuff when they can look within themselves for free. All they need is a bit of basic guidance from a forum such as this one and away they go. No need to fuel the ego, and line the pocket of some "Guru"

Torkom? Is that the guy?
<br>
<br>
i dont know who he is but i am know something about him:he his a crap if indeed he loves to scare people and doing bad things.
<br>
<br>
As any other idiot on this world, we should not be afraid of him. Instead we should remember that garbage its garbage.
<br>
<br>
Ignore him and is power will vanish. Things and people have the power that we gave to them.
<br>
<br>
For example, if you see an hot women and think "Jesus! She is too dman good for me! I am not a man for her"- when you think like that you are given up imediatly all the chances with her, even before speaking with the girl. You gave all the power to her and the game didnt start yet!
<br>
<br>
Now, if you think "Ok, she is interesting. I am going to give her some chances with me. She is in a lucky day and i am gonna have some fun tonight, because i am gonna tease her and "bust her balls"". Do this and you win the game.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Same for that crap guy

<section>
On a related point, I just wanted to ask peoples opinion on the idea of people in the astral 'materialising' a temporary body for themselves, as the oroginal poster described.
<br>
<br>
Is such a thing possible? As I said, i would have discounted such a thing in the past but recently I have researched into seance room phenomena (genuine mediums) and time and time again, material objects are recorded as being generated (called 'aports' in medium circles). More interestingly on rare occasions, there are verifiable accounts of the individual who is being contacted actually appearing in front of the group and able to touch people and be touched, suggesting that they were able to generate some kind of solid body, for a short time.
<br>
<br>
How is this possible? I can only imagine that it is due to energy lent by the group.
<br>
If this is possible, then if you have some character in the astral who is able to gain a large physical &amp; astral following, like the guy described here, is it conceivable that he too could generate a presence here if desired? (providing he has enough people who live in fear of him and/or are willing to lend him the required energy?

Douglas: I too have become interested recently in the mediumistic side of things and have been practising opening up a channel whilst fully conscious within the physical; as opposed to all the going through the various transitions between various focus levels, etc. I found it tricky at first but lately I've had some great results.
<br>
<br>
Stephen (EOL007) has experience with this kind of thing. He gave me loads of pointers which I am using to good effect. He also talked to me about "being touched" which happens to him fairly often (which I found absolutely fascinating) and he explained to me how it came about. The idea of manifesting an object or person sounds several steps removed from mere touching, but I wonder what Stephen would have to say. Hopefully he'll stop by the thread and give us some pointers.

<section>
yes, from what i gather, the key to all this seems to be the pooling of resources of a large group of people.. the more involved, the more impressive the results.
<br>
<br>
As for constructing material objects, from my research it all has to do with 'etheric energy' which seems to have the intresting property of being somewhere between the physical and the astral and is therefore useful for generating all kinds of physical objects out of astral constructs.
<br>
However, most of these only have the 'appearance' of hard physical objects and later dissolve again, but they can also make 'real' objects appear by stealing them from somewhere else, coins are popular. Again, some skilled individuals in the astral, working in conjunction with mediums, are able to make use of the vast stores o etheric energy which we all have. When this is utilised in a seance room scenario, the results can be impressive.
<br>
<br>
I've certainly had to revise what I thought was possible and what wasnt since looking at this. Don't get me wrong, you get plenty of money making fakes who are good at slight of hand etc, but there is plenty of far more impressive genuine stuff out there.
