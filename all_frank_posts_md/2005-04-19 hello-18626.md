I hail from montana, right on top of this supervolcanoe I keep hearing about
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
...well if it goes it goes.. i guess... i keep wanting to run away to alaska or canada or south america though, i think that might be a little more habitable but i suppose it probably won't really matter because that sucker's gonna affect the entire planet.
<br>
Well anyhow, I just discovered these forums and I have always been into expanding my consciousness, lately just through natural practices like yoga and meditation. i used to do a lot of drugs, actually, but I think I might be a rare example of a mostly if not fully recovered person, in that I have moved on to higher pursuits. Now I'm more into quantum physics.
<br>
Well... that's me in a nutshell.
<br>
Namaste.
