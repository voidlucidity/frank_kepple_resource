hai everyone
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I just started getting interested in some of this stuff recently, its a little weird granted cos ive never tried or even considered anything like this. I have quite a stressful life and was intrigued the first time I lay down and cleared my mind using some of the methods around here. I managed to forget about all my problems and relax ect one night and I got this nice feeling all over that I can only describe as 'fuzzy'. I longed to stay in that state but I got shocked and my heart rate increased loads and it was no more
