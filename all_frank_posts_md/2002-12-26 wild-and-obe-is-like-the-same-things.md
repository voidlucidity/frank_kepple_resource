There tends to be confusion over this. But, basically, there is no difference between projecting to the Astral, or having a lucid dream in terms of asking the question, am I within the Astral or not? The answer is yes, in each case. The main difference is your level of conscious awareness. The greater your level of conscious awareness, the more you can experience.
