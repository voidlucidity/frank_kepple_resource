<br>
As far as relaxation goes, you just need to be lying on your back fairly comfortably. That's all. Don't "concentrate" on being relaxed. If you do that, you will never be able to do the most important step. Also, put aside all thoughts of "projection techniques" for now. Because concentration on some technique, or other, will again interfere with the most important part, which is:
<br>
<br>
You need to shift your focal point of awareness (or consciousness) upwards. If you concentrate, for a short while, you should realise that your focal point of consciousness is situated immediately behind your physical eyes. And that is probably where it has been all your adult life, during times when you are awake.
<br>
<br>
There lies the difficulty!!!
<br>
<br>
It is SO used to being there, during awake time, it becomes habitually entrenched.
<br>
<br>
Imagine looking at yourself in a mirror and you had drawn a 1cm diameter circle in red felt-tip pen, in the centre of your forehead about 2.5cm up from where your nose joins to your forehead. That's about where you need to be, focal-point of consciousness-wise.
<br>
<br>
You will probably find that the moment you begin doing it, i.e. letting your focal point rise to the correct place, your eyes will "grab it back". You have to teach the eyes to let go and allow the focal point of consciousness to rise up as I describe.
<br>
<br>
As it rises, you may begin to see little shadows, or glimpses of any sort-of this or that. I call it stray energy. Sometimes I might see a little figure coming out of a hazy mist. Just this morning, for instance, I could have sworn I could see the head of a wolf right in front of me! But you need to teach your eyes not to react to it. The way you do that is to keep practising.
<br>
<br>
At first, as your conciousness rises and you see a tiny glimpse of some image or other, the eyes will suddenly try to look. It's like the eyes say, "What was that??? What did I just see!!!" The moment they try to look at whatever it was, your focal point of consciousness will immediately drop back behind your physical eyes. So you'll have to start again. But after a short while, you will pass through the stray-energy stage and begin feeling vibrations. Once you feel those vibrations that's it, you've done it.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, people read all kinds of books about all the many so-called "techniques". I remember the days when I would go to bed, armed with probably 50 techniques for relaxation; 75 techniques for the breath; 20 techniques for the exit, etc., etc. You know, I'd be prepared for any and every eventuality that may arise... and boy was that stressful!!!
<br>
<br>

Yesterday I worked 12 long hours, I came home and was very tired.
<br>
I went to bed and found my mind alert, and easy to stay conscious. While my body was exhausted and very heavy. I tried visioning myself walking around the walls of the room, looking along the wall at all the furniture and pictures. I made it about 3/4 of the way around and broke concentration, had to start again... After 3 attempts of this my physical reacted by falling and tingling asleep,( at least that is my interpretation) and I started to perceive a brilliant light show of shapes and colors. Some which looked like actual objects, but when I concentrated on them they shrunk and went away!  The tingling turned into a rocking motion and my heart began to beat faster and harder.  I couldn't feel the physical on the bed and it was like my senses were all at a single point inside this light show.
<br>
And right then, my wife rolled over and layed her arm across my chest and put her knee into my hip bone. The lights faded, the vibration slowed and I came out of it!  ARRGG!!!   After getting her off me I tried again,  after a minute or so, I had everything going again.  I played with the fine line of letting the conscious go and keeping concentrated on the effort to project.  I lost the game and fell asleep, but it was an outstanding night of action!
<br>
<br>
DJMidgetman,
<br>
I would recommend trying some physical activity between dinner and bedtime. This might help in relaxing your body so you wont have to spend so much effort trying to do it mentally.

<section>
Yes,from what I,ve seen from the last 2 posts,I would have to mostly
<br>
agree.Two key words Nightflier wrote was "Exhausted" &amp; "Heavy".
<br>
If you have not been in this very relaxed state &amp; are not familiar
<br>
with the feeling,you are not sure what to look for.What Frank said
<br>
at the end about having knowledge of heaps of different techniques
<br>
"can" be a problem.Over saturation of information can lead to
<br>
indecision as to "which technique is right for me?".
<br>
So some basics are along the lines of Nightflier advice,if you are at
<br>
a desk job or in school/studies all day your mind is tired but your
<br>
body has barely been used at all,so do lots of excercise or go for a
<br>
run.When your body is ready to have a good rest,lay down or sit down
<br>
&amp; look for the signs that your body feels "Heavy".If you are to the
<br>
point you realize your body is heavier than usual(even though its not)
<br>
you will be at the doorstep of OBE,ville.
<br>
<br>
Despite the cost of living,have you noticed how it remains so popular?
<br>
<br>
Good journeys

 <br>
 No, I'm not saying that at all. You do not "need" anything to project. Any physically and mentally normal person already has everything they need in order to project.
 <br>
 <br>
 You see, these days people are suffering Astral Information Overload. Problem is, commercialism is taking over; books need to be sold, pages of information need to be created, and so forth. Marketing works because, in essence, it fools you into thinking you "need" some "thing" in order to be a better person, say, or to make your life more secure, or whatever. Advertisements play on fear and greed and all kinds of circumstances and emotions so you'll keep buying and buying and buying......
 <br>
 <br>
 But don't get me wrong, I do realise where you are coming from. I just want to make clear the big mistake I see people making, time and again, is they think they need some "technique" in order to project. No, the act of projection is a totally NATURAL event.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, what you DO need (or at least what most of us seem to need) is relaxation coupled with a little meta-physical imagery. So as to kick-start the process of bringing ourselves to the mental point where projection WILL happen (NOTE: The key word to remember here is "little").
 <br>
 <br>
 Have you ever noticed that the sexiest pictures of women, the pictures that really stimulate the most, tend to be the ones where they are NOT fully naked? That's because they tantalise the mind and stimulate it into developing elements of creative fantasy in order to "fill the gaps". Which, in turn, can very quickly stimulate an erection.
 <br>
 <br>
 So the million-dollar question is: How can we "tantalise the mind" into stimulating projection?
 <br>
 <br>
 Okay, the first thing we need to do is to simply relax. Not relax in any particular way necessarily. No, all you need is to simply do nothing more than just lie down on your back and relax... what could be more natural than that?
 <br>
 <br>
 But what has happened is, the marketing-boys have latched onto this and have provided us with an amazing plethora of so-called "techniques"... "Buy my latest Power Technique... No, buy my Super-Power Technique... Hey, over hear, I've got a Super-Power Technique that doubles as a 10-Minute blah, blah, blah, Technique all rolled into one... No, listen to me, I've got the latest Advanced Super-Duper Power Two-Minute Projection Blaster... and if that fails, next week comes the very latest Projection BlasterII that's guaranteed to relax &amp; project more than any other, or your money back!"
 <br>
 <br>
 And so it goes on, ad nauseum.
 <br>
 <br>
 I was flipping through Astral Dynamics yesterday when I came across a section where problems had occured from using the Rope Technique. One person ended up with a pile of rope on the floor; another kept hitting the ceiling, and so forth. What these people have done is to develop (or perhaps they already did have) brilliant powers of creative visualisation. But that is all they have done.
 <br>
 <br>
 Alright, maybe having such an attuned creative power will come in handy in their physical life. Especially if they are a designer of some kind. But it is not at all necessary for Astral Projection. In fact, I maintain that it can quite possibly interfere with the entire projection process.
 <br>
 <br>
 Projection occurs when you shift your focal point of awarenes from behind your physical eyes and move it upwards to the point I described in a previous post to this thread. That is really all you need to do.
 <br>
 <br>
 Your focal point of awareness is simply the part of your brain that gives you the five physical senses of smell, touch, taste, hearing and eyesight. Plus, it allows you to think about things and to remember events.
 <br>
 <br>
 Right, so inside the front part of your brain, about where I told you to imagine the red dot, is a portion of the brain that has the ability to see the Astral region(s). Imagine that the Astral regions are the VHF FM waveband (in the UK it's 88 to 108 megahertz) and that the portion of the brain I'm telling you about is an FM radio. But also imagine that this radio has no loudspeaker - just a headphone outlet.
 <br>
 <br>
 So now imagine a situation where the radio is switched-on and tuned to a station; and you are standing next to the radio wearing a pair of headphones. But the headphones are not plugged in. In other words, the radio is receiving and playing a signal; and you are standing there with everything you need to hear it; but you can't actually hear anything... until... you do the simple act of plugging in the headphones and bingo! Instantly you hear the station.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the physical body, your focal point of awareness are the headphones. The part of the brain that connects to the Astral is the switched-on radio. When you shift your focal point of awareness upwards... you plug in the headphones.
 <br>
 <br>
 It really is that simple.
 <br>
 <br>
 So just lie back, relax, and imagine making that connection by using a little meta-physical imagery. You can climb an imaginary rope, or imagine putting your sense of physical awareness in an elevator, or anything like that will do. The simpler and the plainer it is the better.
 <br>
 <br>
 Also, and this is HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, let your eyes roll back so they are looking upwards. You see, this is SO HIGHLY EFFECTIVE because your focal point of awareness, when you are awake, tends to follow the eyes. Point the eyes up, and your focal point of awareness goes...
 <img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 At first, you may experience stress in the eye muscles. So relax them until the strained feeling goes away and try again. Try to concentrate on not physically holding the eyes up. Just let them roll back naturally. Which they WILL do after just a little practise.
 <br>
 <br>
 You know when you are doing it right, because there will come an instant when suddenly you thought you heard something; or maybe you thought you detected some kind of shadow or movement. At which point the eyes will try to look. Which will have the effect of immediately halting the process. So you will have to start again. This may happen quite a number of times at first, but at least you will know you are on the right track!
 <br>
 <br>
 So please, as a little experiment, put aside all thoughts of using any kind of technique. Simply lie back, gently relax, and let your eyes roll back and imagine your awareness drifting upwards. It is important that you take things very slowly, and handle your mind very gently. It is rather like if you were physically handling a new-born baby. Think of the protective gentleness you would feel towards that tiny new-born soul. Now imagine the same thing, but in mental terms.
 <br>
 <br>
 Please always bear in mind: YOU CANNOT "MAKE" PROJECTION HAPPEN!!!
 <br>
 <br>
 Successful projection is all about creating the right circumstances where you simply let it happen. Understand that conscious-exit projection is a gentle and graceful process. The slightest hint of any kind of mental harshness totally scuppers the whole thing!
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

<section>
Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Would you be kind enough to clarify one thing in particular on this issue of "positioning point of awareness" - because I think you *really* do have something very significant here?
<br>
<br>
When you talk about "raising point of awareness", I understand it to mean raising the point of awareness
<b>
 within the head
</b>
? I emphasise this, because every other technique I have encountered for Astral projection in the accepted sense of the word, per Astral Dynamics for example, requires this deep physical relaxation and trance, and most of all, in all cases  *exteriorisation* of awareness.
<br>
<br>
Your technique - which BTW makes alot of sense for reasons way beyond the scope of this thread - involves what I would say is a normal state of relaxed awareness and mindstate, but with the shifting of the point of awareness focus, to another part of the front of the forehead, and while that point of awareness remains internal to the physical body?
<br>
<br>
As I said, I really do think you have something very important here - it is certainly very revolutionary compared to most other methods I have read and practiced, and could assist many people to project, who would not otherwise be able to project.
<br>
<br>
I would also just like to thank your once again for your *exceptional* contributions to these forums which are very much appreciated.
<br>
<br>
Your perspective amd experience are very welcome, and you are certainly assisting alot of people here for which I thank you most sincerely!
<br>
<br>
Keep it coming

<br>
<br>
Adrian, please understand that you do NOT have to imagine to such a DETAILED extent. If you keep on doing that, chances are, all you will become is an expert at creative visualisation... rather than an expert who can fly around the Astral planes at will.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
If you concentrate on holding a fixed point of awareness, either within or without, doing such a thing will occupy your consciousness and keep it firmly rooted where it normally resides (while awake) which is behind your physical eyes. As such, you will never get to connect your headphones.
<br>
<br>
Simply let your eyes roll back and allow yourself to create a vague notion of your conscious awareness just drifting up through the top of your head. Be very gentle about it. Think of it softly, and not in any kind of real detail. Just let the natural process take over.
<br>
<br>
You see, that's the big stumbling block. That's what I have realised through my interaction with this BBS. People try too hard to have a conscious-exit obe. Once you start imagining, in detail, and doing things like trying really hard... it scuppers the whole process!
<br>
<br>
It's like people get trapped in a Conscious-Exit Catch 22.
<br>
<br>
 The only relaxation consideration you need is to give yourself the once-over; in the sense of asking questions like, "Is my head supported?" or, "Am I warm enough?" and stuff like that. You need conditions such that your physical body feels basically comfortable and will continue to be so for some time. That is all.
 <br>
 <br>
 You don't want your physical arm having it's circulation restricted, for instance, otherwise you'll be pulled back. Which is a bit of a waste of an experience; for something you could have spent a few seconds sorting out at the start.
 <br>
 <br>
 As for your breathing, just let it happen naturally. But it must be through the diaphragm. Maybe you know this already, but if not then there must be information galore on the Internet. Breathing through the diaphragm is how everyone should breathe anyway, as it is far more efficient than trying to raise your whole chest cavity with your lungs everytime you breathe in.
 <br>
 <br>
 The whole physical portion of the initial experience serves nothing more than to confirm that your physical body will just go to sleep and stay there! Believe me, there is nothing worse than enjoying a fantastic Astral experience, only to have your physical body pull you back because of some petty problem... like... the room is stuffy so you sneezed a few times, or whatever. It's a complete PITA.
 <br>
 <br>
 In spite of the precautions outlined, your physical body will *still* pull you back, and seemingly for no reason. So you need to minimise this as much as you can. With me, it has now got to the stage where when I feel this familiar poking on one or other of my shoulder blades I think, "Oh no, what is it this time." So I return saying, "What now?"
 <br>
 <br>
 It may be the dogs have been barking, or my wife got up to have a pee, or whatever. And it always seems to happen when I'm having a most fantastic Astral experience, that's SO totally out of this world... and the physical pulls me back because it's a little too hot, or a little too cold, or there was a strange noise... or a myriad of other things that - at the time - when compared to the experience you were just having, prior to the recall, seem just SO totally irrelevant.
 <br>
 <br>
 So please try doing as I suggest and let me know how it goes. Nothing is going to happen overnight, obviously, but what you need to happen is: you'll be lying there and for a moment you thought, "What was that?" Like you heard som kind of sound, or a tiny flash of light, or whatever. It was just something that kicked your physical eyes back into focus. And when that happens, you KNOW you are on the right track.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your excellent advice
<img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
<br>
<br>
I will definitely try this method. I am a visualiser and a concentrator, so the method you suggest will be very different! But it makes sense based on my knowledge from other areas, and, if it works as I am sure it will, it will also be quite something for many.
<br>
<br>
Just a couple of followup questions - how long does this method take to perfect (do you think - I know it will vary from person to person) and once perfected, how long does it take to project from the beginning of each Astral session?
<br>
<br>
Also - once you feel vibrations, do you need an exit technique, or do you just head straight for the Astral? This appears to be another significant variation.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
<br>
<br>
Look, once you feel those vibrations just bathe in them, let them flow through you up, down, left, right and every other place besides. Because getting those vibrations is IT!!!
<br>
<br>
From then on, you will have the ability to decide where you want to go. In the sense of, right, you just learned to drive and passed your test. So now it's up to you where you choose to drive to. You choose your own road-map. No more is there an instructor beside you saying where you should (or should not) go.
<br>
<br>
With me, I can't stand messing about in the Real-Time Zone... Why? Because that's where I spend my whole physical life! Look, once you have walked through one bedroom wall you've walked through them all, believe me. If you can stay real and enter the Astral proper, you will NEVER look back.
<br>
<br>
Chances are, though, once you feel the merest hint of vibration: like feeling a base-note zub-zub-zub sensation (about two zubs per per second but you don't hear it so much as feel it) you are going to think WTF and immediately come back to the physical. But at least you will have felt an inkling of what the start of it is like. Though at first you will feel confused thinking maybe you just imagined it.
<br>
<br>
As good as authors have been in the past of putting things into words, there is still a MAJOR misunderstanding as to the mechanics of the process. All I am really trying to do, is to simplify the whole thing for you (and anyone else who is listening) as best I can... while teaching stuff that really does work.
<br>
<br>
 The process of projection is a VERY subtle event. Again, it's like (as if) you were handling a new-born child.
 <br>
 <br>
 Roll those eyes back and feel NOT for a projection experience, but simply relax and let your conscious-awareness drift upwards. Do it right, and there *will* come about a situation where suddenly you think, "What was that?" And then you will realise your eyes have just tried to capture this inkling of an image... which has just brought you out of "it".
 <br>
 <br>
 If you can feel that, I promise you, the "it" that you were brought out of IS the correct path.
 <br>
 <br>
 But, by realising that, you may become confused!
 <br>
 <br>
 On the one hand, you will feel that you did actually "let go" and were truly doing "it" correctly as I advise... but, then again, your consciousness may be (at the same time) telling you that such and such cannot possibly be true because, for that instance, you were not "doing" any "thing".
 <br>
 <br>
 I mean, "things" in the sense of doing stuff like "visualising" or any other kind of "projection technique" that you feel you must supposedly be doing in order to reach the Astral realm.
 <br>
 <br>
 As for time, look, it's going to take you a week or two of genuine practise in order for you to get results. What you must do though is catalogue your experiences. That is so darned important.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

<section>
G,day Frank! Interesting posts &amp; strange you have put in words
<br>
something I have been trying myself for about a year.I have never
<br>
read about it in any other books before but decided on my own to
<br>
use this technique of rolling the eyes back as I noticed most people
<br>
tend to roll their eyes back in their head while in deep sleep.
<br>
At first I tried doing it &amp; like you said your eyes get a bit sore
<br>
from the strain of looking up,but I soon overcame this sensation &amp;
<br>
I use it not only with OBE,s but if I wake in the middle of a
<br>
particularly interesting dream or get up to go to the toilet,all I need to do to get back to where I was, is to think about it, roll my
<br>
eyes up &amp; I,m almost instantly there.
<br>
I have been having them since a child &amp; had allready worked a lot
<br>
out before I came across any books on Astral travel/OBE,s.I really
<br>
dont think all the material &amp; techniques I,ve learned since has
<br>
hindered my progress in any way.Of course I had allready experienced
<br>
OBE,s so it wasn't hard to understand what the Authors were trying to
<br>
say.
<br>
I,m not sure of your history or if OBE,s came to you before reading
<br>
about them,but you certainly have read some OBE books &amp; the
<br>
techniques they talk about &amp; sure a lot of techniques wont work for
<br>
some,but what do you suggest for people who have never experienced
<br>
an OBE or read a book on one?Just get comfortable,keep warm &amp; just
<br>
relax &amp; let it happen to you?Dont read anyones books,even though you
<br>
have,as they will confuse you more?
<br>
While this works easily for me,I doubt someone can enter the Astral
<br>
Realms by not being educated whatsoever as to what &amp; where they are
<br>

Frank, what is "WTF" short for?
<img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile_blush.gif"/>
<br>
This "natural process" you describe sounds very what shall I say?, true perhaps, to me...   I don´t think it is necessary to try to HARD  (or utilize 34 techniques) to get where you desire, and that goes for rest of life as well, not only the astral realms.
<br>
<br>
"Go with the flow/force, you don´t have to effort to succeed. Simply put it out clearly to the universe where you would like to go, and then patiently and harmoniously follow the flow of the river of life until it takes you there."
<br>
<br>
I haven´t before tried to roll my eyes upwards, but I have been trying focusing on the famous "third eye area", and that is located right about where you adviced one to move ones awareness to I reckon´...   and as a matter of fact, even if not rolling my eyes upwards (at least not intentionally) I tend to reach some vibrations faster than I would if I did not focus my awareness there.. (haven´t read about focusing there in any book, just like Mobius didn´t read about rollig the eys upwards, perhaps these sort of things is something one somehow feels instinctively?)  But most times I´ve reached the heavy/instense vibrations I´ve TRIED pretty darn hard to project..     ....next time I´ll try rolling my eyes upwards and just let whatever happens happen...
<br>
<br>
Like Adrian sais, you contribute with some good advice and interresting "theories" Frank, keep it coming mate, it´s appreciated by many of us astranauts here I´m sure...

  1) I saw some "stray energy".... and it formed into the shape of a face, and I was distracted.... lol

  <br>
  2) After a  couple minutes, I felt this sensation of rising up really fast.... Is that normal???

 You are on the correct path. That is what happens when you first see stray energy... you get distracted. It may be a face-like thing that comes out of a mist. Or you may see a flash of something. But stick with it and your eyes will learn to just ignore it. The rising sensation is normal, too. It happens because your focal point of conscious awareness is redirecting itself. At first you feel it and you snap back thinking, "What was that I just felt!" Then you realise what happened. At which stage your consciousness has snapped back to where it was before so you have to start again.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
This method does make alot of sense as I said before - however you look at it.
<br>
<br>
I gave it a try last night - but was tired. But a couple of questions arise:
<br>
<br>
1) Is it best to try your method after going to bed for the night - i.e. to Astral travel while you sleep? Or can this method be used at anytime?
<br>
<br>
2) I am so used to using supreme effort to exteriorise point of awareness and hold it there, that I couldn't let go of that habit! I found myself trying to actually *force* my awareness upwards, just as would do to exteriorise it. I gather from what you are saying that is exactly the wrong thing to do?
<br>
<br>
BTW - do you allow your awarness to only rise as far as the centre of the forehead - which of course is the position of the brow chakra, usually associated with psychic abilities, or do you allow your awareness to rise completely though the top of your head?
<br>
<br>
It did occur to me that as you find this method so easy and reliable, you might well have psychic abilities anyway.
<br>
<br>
3) What about memory recall of your Astral experiences upon return?
<br>
<br>
The holy grails of Astral Projection are reliable projection at at will, and full memory recall of the Astral experiences afterwards.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again - it is great to have you around

 <br>
 No, I beg to differ, with respect, it is not like teaching a total novice to drive a car in that way. To do such a thing would be reckless. All I am simply doing, is trying to publish a relatively easy to understand process that should give any physically and mentally normal person a strong chance of having a conscious-exit obe. In the same way, I would expect any reasonably competent car-driver to be able to get into virtually any car and drive it with a sufficient degree of safety.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are all kinds of people in this world. Some of them are what I call "gadget people". A new gadget comes out and they just have to have it. One of my nephews is like that. He just loves digital gadgets and spends hours learning about how they operate. Give him the highest level of complexity, in as small a package as possible, and he's in 7th heaven for days on end playing with it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Me, I'm not a gadget person. In fact, I am the complete opposite. In all areas of my life, I like to keep things basic and simple. Now, I've enjoyed hundreds of obe's over 20 years. However, up until fairly recently, I had never entered what is commonly called the real-time zone. So I started researching how to do it.
 <br>
 <br>
 I came across a website with articles written by Robert Bruce. Instantly, I knew this person was writing from his own experiences rather than describing some fantasy. I tried using the ROPE technique and, hey presto, it worked! I found that by using this kind of meta-physical imagery, in the way Mr Bruce describes, tends to have the effect of projecting you into the real-time zone as opposed to the Astral proper.
 <br>
 <br>
 Which comes as no surprise to me now. Because on subsequently reading Astral Dynamics, Mr Bruce says about how the majority of his experiences have been in the real-time zone. When my experiences have been the complete opposite.
 <br>
 <br>
 With a little adaptation, I found the ROPE technique had the much desired effect of slowing down the whole projection process into the Astral. Something for which I was extremely grateful as, for years, all I ever seemed to be able to do was zoom off with a big whoosh. So many times I would end up flying at a tremendous speed and wouldn't have a clue as to how or where I was going to stop.
 <br>
 <br>
 The technique allowed me, for the first time, to reliably hold the vibrations steady. So it felt like I was bathing in them. At first, I found I could control their intensity with my breathing. But I simplified that to the extent where I can now control them just by imagining increasing or decreasing the energy flow. Again, as with everything, I try and simplify things as much as possible.
 <br>
 <br>
 To be honest, I got bored of climbing the same old rope in the same old way. So I developed different ways of climbing: arms only; both arms and legs; right arm, left leg; right leg, left arm, etc. In doing so I found that it didn't really matter how I climbed the rope. The projection effect was just the same. So one day I imagined I was climbing without a rope. Again, I managed to project no different to before. So, to simplify things even further, I discarded the rope. Then I got bored of climbing. So I just imagined myself drifting upwards through the top of my head. And still I could project exactly as before. Okay, so why not simplify things even further, I thought, and lie down and merely think about projecting. Well, nothing happened. That is, until I directed my consciouness upwards and imagined myself floating out through the top of my head.
 <br>
 <br>
 You see, my actions proved to me that it wasn't the actual ROPE technique that "caused" the concious-exit projection. All it did, was give exactly the right kind of metaphysical-image kickstart that set-off the natural projection process. So now my projections are a million percent more controllable and all I have to do is lie back in a comfortable position and imagine myself drifting upwards. Around 7 times in ten I can controllably project either into the real-time zone or the Astral. But while I found the real-time zone to be a bit of a let down (novelty wears off very quickly, I found) my projections into the Astral have become better than ever.
 <br>
 <br>
 As a result of my study on how to enter the real-time zone, I ended up developing a very simple and easy to understand technique that I now use to project into the Astral with a high degree of reliability.
 <br>
 <br>
 To me, there is no point in my going on to develop (or to learn) thirty or forty different techniques that all basically do the same thing. Provided I have one technique that can project me to where I want to go, with a high enough degree of reliability, I'm fine with that.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, just like there are people who love all kinds of gadjets, I have learnt that there are those people who love to try all kinds of "projection techniques". They avidly read all the books available, searching out every known technique, and relish trying them all. Which anyone is at liberty to do, if such is their thing. But you hit the nail on the head when you said that if you already know what it is like to project, you can easily work out where the author of the technique is coming from.
 <br>
 <br>
 My question is, what if you are in the position of the vast majority of people who have not yet had the benefit of a conscious-exit projection experience?
 <br>
 <br>
 I believe that a LOT of the published techniques are WAY TOO COMPLEX for a total beginner to grasp, all on their own. I also firmly believe that most people who try Astral Projection, after reading books on the subject, try these techniques unsuccessfully; after which they end up in the very same extremely frustrating position of the creator of this thread, Mr DJ.
 <br>
 <br>
 Speaking of whom, he's already on the path to having his first projection experience after only one attempt at doing what I have suggested. Naturally, I wish him every success.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>

Hi Frank - thanks a bunch for your simple tips. I tried these out over the last two nights and had really good results, although they are exactly the same as when I use ROPE also.
<br>
<br>
As I'm falling asleep, I get more and more relaxed, and then my arms and legs start buzzing and I get pressure in the ears and hear sounds like a massive wind is passing my ears. Last night I tried your thingy with the awareness point in the forehead and after a little bit I felt some very deep vibrations, and after about 3 minutes of the usual sensations, I suddnely felt everything in my body change and lost awareness of my heavy, relaxed body and felt very light and airy, then could feel myself rising, like my face waas peeling away from itself. I totally shat myself, my heart was racing and all I could think was, "Holy sh*t, you're doing it son!" then I got way too nervous and my mental state went back to normal. I was really excited though that separation was as easy as simply moving "yourself" out of the physical body. BTW - I also have similar results when using ROPE, so long as I don't "see" it and try and "feel" myself moving up. Anything to exteriorise your point of awareness.
<br>
<br>
What can I do to get past this damn nervousness though? No matter how much I tell myself to calm down, it's too overwhelming separating from your body for the first time! Also, don't you think any form of energy raising / NEW would help?
<br>
<br>
Thanks.

 <br>
 The way you get over the nervousness is by simple, step-by-step familiarisation. Which may sound obvious but that
 <u>
  is
 </u>
 the way it's done. Practice getting familiar with the vibrations. Just bathe in them for a while. Then, when you feel ready, just allow yourself to raise a little bit. Then hold it for a few seconds and come back down.
 <br>
 <br>
 I found the best mental state to have is one of mild curiosity. Also, when having a scary moment on the Astral, I find it soothing to give myself a running commentry of what it is I am feeling or seeing. That way, the portion of your consciousness which gets fearful and immediately says, "Run like hell!!" tends to stay calm.

 1) I like to have a couple of beers or a few glasses of wine in the evening which scuppers any chances of projection (well, for me at any rate). My projection time is early in the morning. Anytime from, say, 4am. But I tend to go to bed early. It's unusual for me to stay up beyond 10pm. I suppose you could try it anytime, provided you could relax fairly comfortably.
 <br>
 <br>
 2) You are an amazing visualiser, Adrian. I couldn't even begin to do a tenth of the visualisation actions you describe and with SUCH clarity and accuracy too!
 <br>
 <br>
 All you do is let your awarenes drift upwards. It will tend to follow the eyes anyway so please do practice allowing them to roll back. The idea is to give it an initial nudge, then it will continue of its own accord... if you can let it. But the ability to do that comes with practice. Which is fun to do because at least you know you are on the right track. There is nothing more soul destroying than doing a whole load of work and then realising it was all to no avail.
 <br>
 <br>
 It helps to use a little meta-physical imagery just to set the process off. Please see my new post where I talk about how I manipulated Mr Bruce's ROPE technique to good effect. Also, I do not wish to appear rude, but I honestly would not know a "brow chakra" from a hole in the ground and I haven't got a psychic bone in my body. I've heard of these chakra points or areas. But I could never get my head around all the more esoteric mystical stuff. I find it all rather too complex to unravel, I'm afraid.
 <br>
 <br>
 As your consciousness plugs into the area of the brain that connects with Astral matter, you should start to see visions in your mind. These visions are distinct from the stray energy you pass through at first. Last time, I saw was a golden coloured building. Other times I may just see wonderous colours.
 <br>
 <br>
 Understand that, at this stage, the process is largely out of your control. So you do not have to think about questions such as, "How high do you visualise your consciousness rising?" And so forth. You only need the intial visualisation "technique" or visualisation anything... just in order to set the process off.
 <br>
 <br>
 It's like DJ said in his post to this thread that he felt a rising sensation. That's the start of it.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you can just let that rising sensation continue, it will mainly be automatic from then on. As you feel that rising, chances are you will begin to see all kinds of mental imagery. Stray energy, colours, shapes, anything. In other words, there will be lots of distractions that will almost certainly snap you back at first.
 <br>
 <br>
 Once I could have sworn there was the head of a wolf pressing against me. It looked like I was staring into its left eye from about 5cm away. So I just looked at it, curious as to what it was and/or what it was doing. Sometimes it can be beneficial if there is some stable visual "thing" close by that you can concentrate on. That way, whatever is going on in the background is far less distracting.
 <br>
 <br>
 3) My other post about my experiences with ROPE touches on the reliability question. You will remember more if you keep the experiences short. Which you must do at first. But before considering all of that, you need to work on getting to the vibration stage. Which is what happens if you can teach yourself to allow your consciousness to keep drifting once you feel it start. Then you can take the next step which is to learn to control things from then on.
 <br>
 <br>
 Jo made a valued contribution to this thread about potential difficulties you have yet to face.

  <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for your kind comments, Adrian, both in this and other posts. Myself, I am grateful that people have found my contributions useful.
  <br>

  It is the first time I ever made any contributions to a BBS on this topic. It was Mr Bruce who put me in touch with you all. And I sincerely wish those of you who have yet to experience it, every success in your first projection.

  Thanks - but it doesn't seem amazing to me - I am not even sure I have the visualisation abilities that you kindly credit me with
  <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
  <br>
  <br>
  I do use visualisation for some of my path work (as it were). But, to give you an idea, with point shift for example, I see a copy of myself standing a few feet away, while being aware of the altered spatial characteristics - e.g. my physical body behind. As for rope - I just can't do that. Every time I try, I "see" a thick glowing etheric white rope hanging from the ceiling, and I see my "hands" holding the rope. That is extremely off putting when it comes to actually imagining these things as you are supposed to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, on balance, visualisation abilities are very useful as well, and I don't want to supress them, and that is one reason for my grat interest in your techniques.

  <br>
  <br>
  Again - here is where I have to be careful of visualising instead of a passive thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  I believe you are very correct though - most OBE techniques involve great efforts in relaxation, trance, awareness shifting and so on. To suddenly be confronted by a method, which has to make incredible sense, and much, much easier in theory thn all other methods, because it is natural, is very difficult to adapt to.
  <br>
  <br>
  So; the eyes roll up, and the awareness drifts upwards to where? And when does one stop it from drifting upwards and wait for the imagry from the Astral?
  <br>
  <br>
  Apologies again for being so slow on the uptake - but I am sure everyone would appreciate getting this exactly right. A numbered list of steps would be great!

    It helps to use a little meta-physical imagery just to set the process off. Please see my new post where I talk about how I manipulated Mr Bruce's ROPE technique to good effect. Also, I do not wish to appear rude, but I honestly would not know a "brow chakra" from a hole in the ground and I haven't got a psychic bone in my body. I've heard of these chakra points or areas. But I could never get my head around all the more esoteric mystical stuff. I find it all rather too complex to unravel, I'm afraid.

  The brow chakra is also known as the "third eye" - it is associated with psychic abilities including tuning in to the Astral. It seems to be you have those abilities. It wouldn't surprise me if you were clairvoyant as well

    As your consciousness plugs into the area of the brain that connects with Astral matter, you should start to see visions in your mind. These visions are distinct from the stray energy you pass through at first. Last time, I saw was a golden coloured building. Other times I may just see wonderous colours.

  That's a bit I can't grasp yet. The awareness drifts up - fine
  <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
  Does one then halt it at the brow area and await the visions, or just allow the awareness to drift ever upwards? If I did the latter, I would probably start seeing ceilings, the moon etc.

    Understand that, at this stage, the process is largely out of your control. So you do not have to think about questions such as, "How high do you visualise your consciousness rising?" And so forth. You only need the intial visualisation "technique" or visualisation anything... just in order to set the process off.

    If you can just let that rising sensation continue, it will mainly be automatic from then on. As you feel that rising, chances are you will begin to see all kinds of mental imagery. Stray energy, colours, shapes, anything. In other words, there will be lots of distractions that will almost certainly snap you back at first.

    Once I could have sworn there was the head of a wolf pressing against me. It looked like I was staring into its left eye from about 5cm away. So I just looked at it, curious as to what it was and/or what it was doing. Sometimes it can be beneficial if there is some stable visual "thing" close by that you can concentrate on. That way, whatever is going on in the background is far less distracting.
    <br>
    <br>
    3) My other post about my experiences with ROPE touches on the reliability question. You will remember more if you keep the experiences short. Which you must do at first. But before considering all of that, you need to work on getting to the vibration stage. Which is what happens if you can teach yourself to allow your consciousness to keep drifting once you feel it start. Then you can take the next step which is to learn to control things from then on.

I'm sorry but I really do not understand terms such as "brow chakra" and "third eye" and so forth. Yes, I have read about such things in the past but I'm really not all that clued up, definition-wise.
<br>
<br>
But what I do know is, the act of projection is a very natural part of the human condition. You are good at visualisation so a good solution may be to simply visualise yourself being a complete beginner starting from scratch.

 Regarding the brow chakra or third eye - I am no expert either, I just know that it is in the centre of the forehead and associated with psychic abilities
 <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 As far as your suggested visualisation goes - that would be imagination I guess rather than visualisation. But you have a very good point - the vast majority of people are so used to the concept of deep relation, trance, exit methods etc., that to do your method literally does mean unlearning all of that, and focussing on allowing the awareness to rise as you describe.
 <br>
 <br>
 The key to relaxation and trance might be the fact that you suggest early in the morning after waking up, where these conditions would be present naturally of course. I would think that using an alarm clock set a couple of hours before getting up would be a very good idea in conjunction with your method.
 <br>
 <br>
 Anyway - thanks again for all of your patience and assistance here

 Hmmm...
 <br>
 <br>
 Well my definition of visualisation is to see something in your "minds eye", as if you were seeing it with your physical eyes. Or alternatively, to create such a visualisation based on imagination. For example, I can close my eyes, and see a scene, e.g. in the country, as if I was actually there and seeing it with my own eyes. Visualisation and imagination often get crossed by people. To me, imagination is more spatial than visual.
 <br>
 <br>
 For example, take rope exit - you are supposed to "imagine" the rope, and feel its texture, and feel the effort of climbing it. I have difficulty with that - I see the rope, and see my hands climbing to the ceiling, I see the rope coiled on the floor etc., but without excerpting the pressure on my energy body where it is needed.
 <br>
 <br>
 Many exit techniques do depend on pure visualisation.
 <br>
 <br>
 Your Astral projection method has many qualities and advantages over all of the above, and, I have to say, based on my own ongoing path work, makes considerable sense all round.
 <br>
 <br>
 It seems to me that what comes naturally to one person, might not to the next, and vice versa. Some people are naturally very clairvoyant for example, others can do (psycho)telekinesis very easily - I guess we all major in certain areas, but can adapt to the whole with practice and good advice and training.
 <br>
 <br>
 However - visualisation can be extremely useful in the Astral - as you know - these things are magnified enormously from the physical to the Astral - it is like comparing a pocket calculator to the worlds most powerful supercomputer. Using pure visualisation and energy, anything can be created in the Astral, its durability depending on the amount of energy involved, and how often it is repeated before the visualisation "sets". That is one basis for Magic - "as above, so below". You will have come across Temples in the Astral I am sure - well they are built by pure visualisation by their owners, and are always there to return to and work from.
 <br>
 <br>
 I hope that doesn't sound too convoluted?
 <br>
 <br>

Hi
<br>
<br>
Well on Adrian's request, here's my experience with your technique Frank.  Ok first off I want to say that I tried this technique 'cause I feel really comfortable with it and it's much easier to do next to my wife in bed than to explain to her why I'm doing the tensing and relaxing of my muscles when she notices it, since she's totally against the whole idea of AP as I've mentioned in other posts.  This is also almost how I started out to try and project that first 2 or three times right at the beginning.  Previously I had really good results with just lying in my bed waiting for my body to fall asleep, got the vibrations, feel very light etc.
<br>
<br>
Ok last night,  I layed on my back with arms next to me and hands on my legs.  Relaxed my body completely and after only a few minutes I felt pretty heavy, then I tried to roll my eyes back and shift awareness to my forehead.  the first two times I was forced to start again due to the fact that I started to snore (BTW I apparently snore quite heavily during sleep) so the 3rd time I made sure all my throat muscles were relaxed and started to snore softly before I tried again -just for explanation, I don't force myself to snore, but if I relax all facial muscles and throat muscles it starts automatically).  I then tried to move my awareness again and this time like other times before I get a really strange feeling over my body and it's extremely active or noticable in the part of my head obove my eye brows.  During this period I'll sometimes hear sounds and see different images, but with no definate form This continues for a few moments (I can't really explain this feeling) and then suddenly it'll feel as if I'm in space (or rather how I think it'll feel in space) I don't feel any of my body then or it kind of feels more like my whole body's changed into a cool liquid or something like that and If there's nothing around me for miles, but I can't really see anything.  This is very pleasant actually and I think I'd be quite content just experiencing that for hours, but it doesn't last very long.  Usually after only a little while I'll hear a very load bang, like someone hitting a log of wood on a table last night It sounded like someone shouted out something really loud as if right next to my ear.  And that's just how far I came After this happens I flick back to full consiousness and open my eyes, since my body is still asleep I'll just lie a second or two and then sit right up in bed.  I'm fully awake then and I feel really energized (If you understand what I mean - kinda like just after you got out of a cold shower on a hot day).  I usually get up at this stage since I definately can't go back to sleep then, I'm much to awake and feel as if I have enough energy to go through the whole day after the hour or so I just went through.
<br>
<br>
I think I should not try to go back to sleep after one of these sessions one day and see how, it goes.
<br>
Well that's about as accurate as I can put it down on paper.  I'll try again tonight.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

  You know when you are doing it right, because there will come an instant when suddenly you thought you heard something; or maybe you thought you detected some kind of shadow or movement. At which point the eyes will try to look. Which will have the effect of immediately halting the process. So you will have to start again. This may happen quite a number of times at first, but at least you will know you are on the right track!

 Greetings to All.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have been researching as much as possible on OBE's over the last six months with no results of any kind...
 <br>
 <br>
 I've read everything there is to read and I am one of those poor souls, who arm themselves with 65 techniques before I goto bed.
 <br>
 <br>
 I fear that I have drowned my brain with knowledge and it just isn't practical... I have been drawn close to calling it quits, and forever giving up on what I can honestly say is one of the most important aspects of my life.
 <br>
 <br>
 I stumbled on this BBS accidently and found this post, Im interested in what you have had to say FRANK and I am going to give your method a shot.
 <br>
 <br>
 Could you clear something up for me before I fail miserabley?
 <br>
 <br>
 Once the imagery appears or the sounds begin to distract me. Do I?
 <br>
 A) ignore them and continue
 <br>
 B) pay attention to them?
 <br>
 <br>
 Paying attention to them usually leads me to fall asleep or slip into a dream.  But you say that you were focusing your attention on the wolf's face when it had appeared.. what am I doing wrong?
 <br>
 <br>
 I can roll my eyes, I have no great visulization skills. All I know is that I will accept what will be presented to me, should a higher power grant me that gift.
 <br>
 <br>
 Good luck to every one out there, trying to do this without a real clue..
 <br>
 <br>
 Reading alot about this thing doesn't realy help in my case, I bet im not the only one.

Ha, no, you're definitely not the only one. I'm beginning to suspect that my troubles may be related to a 'technique syndrome' as well. I'm now trying Frank's method, and I will report results when I get some (Frank said it may take a week or two.) Perhaps then I shall get my coveted first conscious projection.
<br>
<br>
First off, Dragon, you say 'before I fail miserably' and you're already setting yourself up for defeat. Robert said one of the most powerful resources you have for projection is the belief that you can do it. Don't doubt yourself, you've projected many times before; just not consciously and you haven't remembered them.
<br>
<br>
You should probably ignore any visuals/sounds, as they tend to distract you from your goal. This state of 'letting' everything happen is tricky to learn at first but it can be learned easily. It didn't take me long to do so.
<br>
<br>
Don't worry about your visualization skill right now, believe you can do this, and relax. I know the frustration you're feeling. I felt it too, but now I'm telling myself that it will happen when it's supposed to happen. Everything, big and small, follows the divine plan. Just patiently test-drive Franks method, as I'm doing, because it sounds simple and straightforward.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck,

You need no-one to grant you the gift, as you call it. You just need to work on it some more. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not calling you lazy or anything like that. (It's so darned easy to get misunderstood in these places!).
<br>
<br>
I'm getting to think that there must be SO many people in the same boat as yourself. But I always say that if I can do it, then anyone can. When I first started, I was a complete and utter non-believer in any kind of God, or religion, or any kind of mystical stuff of any kind. I haven't got a psychic bone in my body. I wouldn't know a Chakra from a hole in the ground (or at least, I think until this morning. The experience of which I'll reserve for a new thread). I had neither had a "hunch" of any kind, nor any "instinct" for anything in particular.
<br>
<br>
I think the only aspect of myself that I feel has helped is the fact that I eat sensibly, and my level of health and fitness is fairly good. I would think that feelings like indigestion, bloatedness, internal pains, and so forth, would go against having a naturally induced obe experience.
<br>
<br>
So don't give up. Trust me, being within the Astral is like nothing you could ever imagine. It's so flaming marvellous, and words can in no way grasp the magnitude of feeling of stepping within the Astral for the first time.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

 I would suggest you are making progress there - did you get the vibrations?
 <br>
 <br>
 I have spent the last couple of days studying this, because I think Frank really has something significant here. Thus far I have found a couple of useful facts gleaned from various places:
 <br>
 <br>
 1) Tibbetan and Buddhist monks spend alot of time focussing intently on their brow chakras. They say that this could drastically improve OBE capabilities, but their main objective is Kundalini enlightenment.
 <br>
 <br>
 2) There is a modification to Frank's excellent method which could be well worth trying as follows:
 <br>
 <br>
 When you go to bed, set your alarm for 6 hours after you would fall asleep. When the alarm goes off, get up and read, surf the net etc. for an hour, and then go back to bed focussing on your brow Chakra, while going back to sleep. One of two things could then happen - you either go into a lucid dream state, or awake with waking paralysis and/or vibrations, at which point you can leave your body - I would do it by visualisation - rising upwards. If you go into the lucid dream state, you can often will yourself to have an OBE, and the above will occur at that point.
 <br>
 <br>
 3) Raising energy via NEW to your brow Chakra might work well with this method, before going to sleep, or focussing on the brow Chakra.
 <br>
 <br>
 These have got to be well worth trying anyway.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am posting a separate topic on this - but do people have theories on the difference between Lucid Dream and OBE?
 <br>
 <br>
 With many thanks again to Frank for motivating me to do this research

WOW! I am very impressed with the response from all you people. *CHEERS*
<br>
<br>
The last board I was on had a month between each post!
<br>
<br>
Well, as an update.  I tried the "FRANK" technique last night.
<br>
(Does it have a name?) and I found the results to be very strange.
<br>
<br>
I focused on my brow for around 5 mins, and for the length of that 5 mins I can't recall anything. I woke up 2-3 times during the night and I found that after waking, if I focused on that point again.
<br>
I fell asleep instantly.
<br>
<br>
And to top it off, ever since I got up this morning, I've had an unbelievable pain (almost a tightness) between my eyes.
<br>
Been awake now 7 hrs and it is just begining to fade.
<br>
 <br>
 I'd like to share somthing else with you also.  I'll post it in a different post, to make it easy.
 <br>
 <br>
 Thanks again,
 <br>

Me again,
<br>
<br>

*This is about the farthest I think I have ever gotten*
<br>
About one and a half years ago. (When I FIRST started OBE practise)
<br>
I was doing a technique to achieve trance, the "vibrations" came. and I knew it was them. I felt my heart pulse, it rose to (what I believed to be) an unbelievable speed. I really started to worry and started to panic quite badly.
<br>
<br>
At this point I woke after a very deep sinking feeling.
<br>
<br>
I'm not asking you what this was, or wether it was close. Because I believe I already know the answer.
<br>
<br>
I hadn't practised OBE for 2 years since then.
<br>
<br>
CHEERS

I've found something really significant!
<br>
<br>
Before I tell you about it, I'd like to say that on another post I was thanked by a member for motivating them to do research: Well, I too would like to say a big THANK YOU for motivating me to make the progress I made in just the past week alone. Interacting with this BBS has caused my meta-physical studies to take a much higher priority in my physical life and my progress has taken a giant leap.
<br>
<br>
Okay, I've said before about how I could never get my head around all the more mystical side of things. I hear all these terms, like, there was one to this thread which was "Path Work". Now I've heard about that somewhere but haven't got a clue what it means. Another term that I hear ever so often is "Chakra" which I could not for the life of me get my head around. To me it sounds like a brand of crisps.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
That's another reason why I was attracted by Mr Bruce's work. Because he basically felt the same way and attempted to create more modern-day terms that described his experiences.
<br>
<br>
The past few days, I have been trying to slow down the projection process and try and feel each stage, step by step. The problem I have found, is thinking about what is happening puts a BIG spoke in the works. An important prerequisite is to rid your mind of stray thoughts. Well, the body sees the thoughts that are monitoring what is going on as the equivalent to stray thoughts.
<br>
<br>
So what I did was, allow a little of the projection process to begin and then I'd think, right stop there, note this down, then I'd start again letting it go a little more, then stop and make note, etc. In doing so I have made several discoveries about myself. For example, normally at the onset of vibrations I'd just let them happen then whoosh... off I'd go and land in the Astral somewhere. But I discovered that the vibrations actually begin as an ever so tiny tingle in my fingertips and travel up my arms. Whereas, before, I could have sworn they just "begin". As to where they came from, or the direction they were travelling in, I just wouldn't have a clue.
<br>
<br>
However, I made one big discovery about the relaxation process that I'm going to talk about on another thread. In a previous post to this thread I said about how you lie back and simply relax. However, I discovered, while that is what I feel I'm doing, when I came to break down the process, step by step, and take things one bit at a time: I realised there is a process that occurs, but it normally happens so smoothly and so quickly I never knew about it. In other words, the "relaxation process" for me, had become a habit.
<br>
<br>
Physical relaxation is a very necessary part of the process. But what I found was you can "relax" in a certain "way" and it has the effect of channeling energy up through your body to the extent where it appears to *automatically* trigger the vibrations.
<br>
<br>
More later on a new thread.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
