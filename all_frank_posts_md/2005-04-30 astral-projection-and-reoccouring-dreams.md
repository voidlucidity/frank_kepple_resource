<section>
maybe someone can explain this.
<br>
<br>
when ever I try to astral project, I have these lucid type dreams why I can fly,and do such things, yet the place where I am in this "dream/astral projection"  are familiar.
<br>
<br>
Today i woke up and remember the dream I had. In it I was flying and doing all stuff, but the place i had been to before...
<br>
<br>
Can anyone explain this to me or has this happened to anyone?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yes, it will appear similar because you are actually within the same area within consciousness. The wider reality has 4 primary focuses of attention. In my Phasing Model of consciousness I call them Focus 1 to Focus 4. Focus 1 is the physical and Focus 2 is where most people do their dreaming, lucid dreaming, astral projecting, pathworking, and a whole load of other things besides.
<br>
<br>
What you are doing in your case, is changing your perception within the same area of consciousness, i.e. Focus 2. As I've said a number of times, it is perfectly possible to change your
<i>
 perception
</i>
in consciousness and to not actually change your area within consciousness. So people can quite easily switch from a lucid dream to an astral projection-style experience and back again or view them both at once if they want.
<br>
<br>
I think this aspect is perhaps one of the most confusing for people to get to grips with, which is why I keep stressing the point. When we are in the physical we are so used to actually having to "travel" from one place to another in order to get somewhere. But once we step within, there is no longer any need to "travel" anywhere. We simply shift our perception and our environment will change accordingly.
<br>
<br>
The problem has been that when the early explorers started to do this, they
<i>
 objectified
</i>
what they were viewing. In other words they looked at it as some kind of other world that they were travelling to. In much the same way as we travel within the physical. So concepts such as "astral travel" was born. But we don't actually "travel" anywhere.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
first off thanks for replying to this. Now on the topic of traveling, I have a hard time getting around in these states. it seems that I "lose  power" if I try to fly or do such things, I end up on the ground. Like I will fly up for a while amd then slowly gravity will pull me down.
<br>
<br>
If gravity does NOT exists in the astral, why am I pulled down?
<br>
<br>
now I know these places lucid dreaming or astral projection, that are familiar. I have "dreamed them before", in-fact, now that I think about in just about 80% of the dreams I have had that I can remember throughout my 26 years of existence have been in these places.
<br>
<br>
These places look somewhat like our world, yet things are different. It would be like going back to your old neighborhood that you grew up in as a child and went back to realize that although you have this warm feeling of being back at a place with many memories, things have changed.
<br>
<br>
That is how both my astral/lucid experiences have been.
<br>
<br>
It amazes me as I sit here and think, that I seem to remember these places. I cant put my finger on it, but could it be in some real time zone?
<br>
<br>
Do you think we interact with others in the dream world from the real world? Like if I meet my ex-girl friend in the astral, is that really her in the astral sense, more over is that the astral counterpart of my physical ex, or did my mind create her?
