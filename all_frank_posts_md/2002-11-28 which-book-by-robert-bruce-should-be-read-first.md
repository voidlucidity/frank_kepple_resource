Hello Everyone,
<br>
This is my first post here, I have recently purchased _Astral Dynamics_ by Robert Bruce and have downloaded the 90 Day guide on this website that accompanies it.  I have also noticed that there is a book also published about Psychic Self-Defense and my question is are the exercises in the Astral Dynamics book safe to begin or do you suggest reading the Self_Defense book first to protect one self?

Well, I have yet to get PPSD but I have read Astral Dynamics and it's great.  Nothing in there made me say, "Holy crap, I've just been given the equivalent to a loaded gun and now I have no protection!"
<br>
<br>
If anything, he talks about a lot of stuff in Astral Dynamics which you'll find very beneficial to you.  So from MY standpoint, it won't hurt you to read AD firstm because that's what I did and I'm not so bad off.
<br>
<br>
Unless you count this horrible case of diarrhea that I happen to be battling on Thanksgiving.

Keep smiling,

Astral Dynamics. Bit of a heavy read but has loads of tried and tested techniques for beginners.
<br>

I agree... Read Astral Dynamics first..  Unless you are specifically having a psychic difficulty in your life and then, of course, read the other first..
<br>
<br>
They are both very wonderful!  FULL of good info..  They both go into great details on two entirely different subjects and each is done equally well in it's own way..
<br>
<br>
I personally don't use protection by the way..  A lot of people might think me nuts for that but I don't think so.  I try with an effort to keep a positive attitude in general, and try to associate and be around only good things in my life and try to only think good thoughts..  And ONLY speaking for and about me personally, I feel this is enough for me..  Each person [I feel], needs to make their own decision about it and accept their own consequences..
<br>
<br>
I tried for over one year to repeat an OBE experience.  But when I realized that maybe I was hindering myself with my "fear", I decided to release it and I symbolically [mentally] opened myself up to all the energy out there that I knew I was apart of and put complete trust that I was okay and doing the right thing and decided to "be".. I felt vast relief inside..  Very close to the same time frame, I started making major energy progress.  Was it related to this?  Who knows...  I like to think so..   Before I had done this however, I had quit trying to OBE.  I did only energy work and my point of doing that was to draw more energy to me..  No other goal but that..  It was later that I made attempts to OBE again.   [couple months]  It wasn't long before I had a second OBE..  I used only the methods in AD.  I bought the book three months ago..  I read the treatise and have a printed copy of it that I found 6 months ago.   It did not take me too long.. You can do it if I can do it!
<br>
<br>
My point:  Don't be afraid...[It will inhibit your goal..]  Trust yourself and absolutely let go and just be..  It can only get better...  That's what I tell myself too..
<br>
<br>
Good luck!...Blossom
