It would be nice to block specific users from PMing your or Emailing you.  In 4 months it has only been an issue once, so it's not that important, but something for the 'Wish List'.

Rastus: I'm not sure whether the facility will be added at some date. That's Adrian's department I guess. But if you get an abusive PM, then please contact a forum moderator right away.

This feature will be in the new version of PHPBB (2.2.0) I cannot say if Adrian will update to that or not though.

<br>
If you want to check thier website then at the bottom of each page is a link to thier home page, and if you check some of the most recent announcements you can go to their development page and check out the new version of PHP.
<br>
<br>
EDIT: The testing board for the new version is located here:
