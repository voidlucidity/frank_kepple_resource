Am hoping I am allowed to do this, but just wanted to suggest a great site for spiritual development. It holds free classes in various things most nights in its chatroom and they really are a lovely gang there. Here is the addy

Hi Kate,
<br>
<br>
Looks fine to me. The forum works and is very comprehensive. I noticed they apply strict moderation and a safe use policy for readings etc - which is admirable considering the number of exploitative psychic chat sites around.
<br>
<br>
Very refreshing!
<br>

As with all things in life, for some, it will be just their cup of tea ( to use an appalling cliche) and for others,it will be just a little too quiet, or just a little too 'nice' lol.
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
The forum can get a little quiet at times, but then, the largest number of members at it's busiest time since it's opening far outweighs the largest number on here at it's busiest time!
<br>
<br>
Chat gets very busy from around 8-9pm each night, and well, ya know, it is a uk site with less than 700 members compared to the 7000 + members on this site...maybe somewhere to go for some quiet browsing, eh, rofl.
<br>
<br>
Glad some of you like it.

I have no idea where you are ending up. Clicking on 'Forum' down the lefthand side on the main front page should have taken you to the forum and a number of sections. Once there, there is a button titles 'New Topic' in the right hand corner of all sections and at the bottom right, 'add reply'.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, try the link above and be sure to sign in. Samson made it ok, so there is nothing at all wrong with the site, I assure you.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes

Thanks for the link, Kate. The website will be fun to explore, and the forum does have a lot of interesting topics too.

Hi Frank, you find a link to chat on the main front page where there is a list down the left hand side...you simply register your name and password for chat then you are straight in. Here is the link to the main front page again. Alternatively click on the link for walk with spirit at the very top of the forum on left hand side.

Ha ha, I got it now.
<br>
<br>
I'm way out in the sticks and only have dial-up. The front page takes a little while to load in stages. The moment the "Forum" button appeared I kept clicking on it each time. Now, I left the front page to load further and sure enough, a "Chat" button appeared. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,

<br>
Thanks again, I've worked it out now! Managed to login but kept accidentally logging out. It's a bit quiet at the mo' but will popin later. I've never been in a chatroom before... it's kinda spooky, lol.
<br>

Yours,
