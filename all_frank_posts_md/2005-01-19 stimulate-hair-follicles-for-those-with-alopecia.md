<section>
Male pattern hair loss is an inherited condition, caused by a genetically determined sensitivity to the effects of dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. DHT is believed to shorten the growth, or anagen, phase of the hair cycle, causing miniaturisation of the follicles, and producing progressively finer hairs. The production of DHT is regulated by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.
<br>
<br>
That's what the doctor told me....  I was depressed before he told me, now I'm even worse..... I shall be having words with my uncle for the early inheritance.
<br>
<br>
More than likely this is a question which can't be answered but I thought what the heck...
<br>
<br>
Now after reading Robert Bruce's books on Astral Dynamics, New Energy Ways and his healing tutorials and testimonials on his website it occurred to me that with the intent of healing and raising energy into my poor head I could possibly somehow stimulate the hair follicles into growing?
<br>
<br>
Apparently giving your scalp a three-minute massage each day may increase blood flow to your hair follicles and help hair growth by using your fingertips to gently rub all over your scalp.
<br>
<br>
So can it be done....? Can I / others self heal this condition by raising energy to the region?
<br>
<br>
I know my names Captain Picard but seriously I don't want to turn out looking like him – I'm sure he polishes his head.

It would be a pretty cool thing if you would try it for 6 months or so and then tell all of us if it worked.
<br>
<br>
I've tried lots of things with NEW and the gathering and manipulation of energy. I haven't regretted any of my time or effort spent.

<section>
I don't know if it would work or not - certainly a good head massage on a regular basis is a good idea, not only to stimulate the hair follicles but also to stimulate the blood flow to the brain.
<br>
<br>
As far as putting energy into the scalp goes, it may have the effect of overactivating the crown chakra before the other chakras have been developed, possibly leading to problems, but then again, it may not.
<br>
<br>
My question is:  Why does it matter so much?  Plenty of men lose their hair and to many women it's a sign of virility - in any case, it's only self-image and it's the person inside that counts, not what's on the outside.
<br>
<br>
I personally worked on a vanity or self-image problem a while ago which wasn't easy (and perhaps more difficult as a female?) but I decided that as long as I was caught up with self-image, it wasn't doing me any favours, and I found that once I'd carried through my intent, it actually didn't really make any difference to the way people perceived me.

It sounds neat, cheaper than a transplant I suppose. This sounds like more of a healing topic though. Energy Body is a too-crowded forum.

Anything is possible as long as you have faith!  Take Robert Bruce who healed the twelve-year old boy, José who was steadily going blind from an acute congenital eye condition. After his second visit, José threw away his very thick and expensive glasses and refused to wear them ever again. He said that he could see better without them, much to the concern of his parents and eye specialist.  On his fourth weekly appointment, José marched into Bruce's sanctuary with sparkling eyes and an awestruck mother in tow. After an earlier appointment with his eye specialist, it was found that José now had perfect 20/20 vision. His eye specialist was at a total loss to explain the reversal of the eye condition that José had been born with.
<br>
<br>
I myself have assisted in healing patients with Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritis relieving them of the pain and swelling.  I also work for a cancer healing clinic.  And currently I'm helping a young lady with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
<br>
<br>
This is just some examples of the great powers of healing and what can be achieved by energy channeling.
<br>
I am going to focus on raising energy into the head area with the intent on stimulating hair follicles.  I shall bear in mind that it's closely related to the major Brow and Crown Chakra but I believe if my intent is to accomplish stimulating the hair follicles and by asking for help to my higher self or guides I am certain I can achieve a positive outcome.
<br>
I shall practice this experiment alongside my daily energy work which is generally twice daily... after 2 months I'll look to see if there's any changes and of course feedback.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
According to medical science DHT also controls the abilty to have and maintain an erection, or so I believe. So that's probably where the enhanced virility thing stemmed from. But I'm guessing there is no truth in it.
<br>
<br>
Male Pattern Hair Loss you could say was a belief construct that expresses an underlying energy dysfunction. In theory it could be reversed, but chances are it would be pretty hard as these kinds of constructs are very powerful and you'd have doubts galore.
<br>
<br>
With any kind of self-healing, the elimination of doubt is the key. It's one of those things that sounds ever so easy to say, but is a heck of a tricky balancing act to perform, as it requires a total acceptance and trusting of Self. Much of what society labels disease is the objective manifestation of an internal conflict. Well, it doesn't have to be. It could be something the person created for the purposes of their experience, in which case there is no conflict.
<br>
<br>
But that begs the question of why would a guy want to experience a bald head? I don't know the answer to that. He he, maybe I should shave mine and find out. :)
<br>

If the root of the tree has gone bad, one of the branches will not bare leaves.
<br>
<br>
Saw palmetto, a natural herb which is used for Prostate Problems in men, has an enzyme which eats up the DHT in and around the Prostate thus releasing the pressure on it allowing it to function properly. It is believed that the hormones of the Prostate have a direct influence on the hair of men's heads.  Oh, and the Saw palmetto enzyme also eats up the DHT around the hair follicles allowing the hair to grow freely.
<br>
<br>
Eunuchs never go bald, because their organ has been removed, no testosterone is produced and thus no by-product of DHT.

I thought it was L-Arginine being converted into Nitric Oxide, that maintained erections.
<br>
<br>
And the reason for energy depletion and hair loss, is sexual exhaustion.
<br>
Costantly having to replenish what was loss, generating more testosterone, making more DHT. Men are screwing their hair out.

In each area a chakra exists, on the male body a patch of hair exists.
<br>
1.root chakra-butt hair
<br>
2.sex chakra- pubic hair
<br>
3.navel chakra- happy trail
<br>
4.heart chakra- chest hair
<br>
5.throat chakra-a beard, like mine
<br>
6.third eye chakra, ajna chakra-(in which this chakra has two petals)
<br>
the two eyebrows
<br>
7.crown chakra(in which according to different Vedic scriptures the amount of petals were 1,000; 90,000; 100,000; and 120,000) the hair on top of your head
<br>
<br>
black haired people have 90,000 hairs
<br>
red/brown haired people have 100,000 hairs
<br>
blonde haired people have 120,000 hairs.

Different genes are activated and deactivated by environmental conditions.
<br>
<br>
If the body produces semen in proportion to protein intake, it would be a question spiritual exhaustion, if anything. I have a feeling that it is the kind of sex that appeals to the lower nature which is depleting.
<br>
<br>
Still, this doesn't give an answer to how to bring back what was gone.
<br>
<br>
The topic came up before the forum was renovated. A person with very fast hairgrowth stated that it was due to nothing more that hime willing energy into his hair. However, depending upon the nature of the exercize, this can also be depleting to the base chakra.
<br>
<br>
I would think along the lines of iron-shirt, but this can be dangerous, too.

What the?!!!  Iron-shirt Chi Kung?
<br>
Saw palmetto contains an enzyme that eats up DHT(a by-product of testosterone production).
<br>
I never said the body produces semen in proportion to protein intake, however (L-arginine an amino acid that is part of protein) L-Arginine converts to Nitric Oxide which makes erections harder.
<br>
<br>
Sex drains the body of liquids, especially the orgasm hormones,  nutrients responsible for sperm production, lubricating glands, and most of what is lost is first produced in the brain. A lot of the mental and nervous system disorders that are widespread now-a-days is because of too much sex. Men who have sex more than other men lose their hair faster, and suffer much more.
<br>
<br>
If you doubt this, then by all means have sex or masturbate yourself 3-6 times a day for a whole month, and see what debilitating side-effects occur.

In tightening the etheric web, the exercize is said to close holes in the aura. Pertinent holes may occur in, (but are not limited to) the basic,  throat, heart, or crown chakras.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore,  if performed properly, it will cause a sort of polarization which acts against energy drains. (Being intentionally obtuse.)  If performed inproperly, imbalances can be externalized turbulently.
<br>
<br>
Also, if you
<i>
 are
</i>
of aware ChiKung, it promotes the retention of semen in that the testosterone is said to recirculate and rejuvenate the brain. Will the byproducts of this rejuvenation cause tissue damage?
<br>
<br>
The same hormones produced in orgasm  result from physical exertion, and can be produced at will by different kinds of meditation.

Though women are beautiful, I'm quite abstinent. Testosterone is still produced in dominant psychological states, whereas submissive ones cause automimmunities.
