Here's a quick one folks...
<br>
<br>
I've been having these nonchalant meetings with my guides that I never really paid too much attention too, but I the their something like Moen's non-out-of-body meetings, so I guess you'd like to hear it, and it'd be inspiration.
<br>
<br>
But after connecting with my Source Self and my guides real well they are nothing but a thought or intent away. And I realized that there was this kind of rift between us- my guides and me. But I started reading
<i>
 Cosmic Journeys
</i>
again and I see how the names could be limiting. I intended for a name for my guides and always got one, but her guides were like- no names are needed. It would be an interference. So I connected with my guides no through name but at the
<i>
 essence
</i>
level, and they were like masses of energy, like clouds. No name, but just the essence, and we were closer. And it is not like we are student/guide, or something, but friends, and beings, and one. The name and my intention and expectation put a form on them, when they were formless. And I say they because Okanos, excuse the name [:O], my 'previous' guide was there/here also. I thought he'd left when my present one came. But I was rereading a book that he basically channeled, or the part of it that was done, and thinking I'd really like him to finish it, so that my be why he's back. But I could percieve that it had much to do with the fact that I dropped the names of them, in relation to them. So it was me and in my awareness there were these two presences, or entities, that were masses of energy and formless, like globules of energy, and their essences were their names, and they each had their unique energy signiture, which was Ok. They were very identifiable. But without names they... we were closer. We were both essences- I and them. And it was a meeting of essences, rather than a meeting of personalities, or forms. It was interesting. That is how it was when I had the little meeting thing when I asked about the CD situation.

Later I stopped the linear lingo and just went for the communication and a lot of stuff went by- back and forth- like how it relates to the computer. Technology such as sound waves to alter states are like the computer and it's use in writing. It saves time, is more efficient in doing work, and is just a great help. The skill of the writer is not diminished any. One is no less a writer because he doesn't use a quill and ink. But alas, another lesson learned- or morer rather. [:O]

Part of me wants to apologize for all that being one paragraph, but it all came in one 'paragraph like that "and I want you to get the feel.

Take care.

Please give me some feedback on this. I'd appreciate it much-es. [

Very interesting post. Especially as, early on, I was corrected in the exact same manner! I was told, "There is no such thing as could have, should have, might have, may have - strike that nonsense from your thinking - there is only what you want."

HOLY MOLY!   My guide said that to me too!  "What do you WANT?  How can I help you if you don't even know what you want?"  And when I came out of the experience, I knew she was right.

<br>
OY.  Now I know it really WAS my guide.  I never gave her a name, other than "The Lady."

Hey Frank! Hey Tisha!
<br>
<br>
Thank you. Thank you.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing. It is so powerful when we all share and can corraborate our experiences like this. Just like in Christopher's Source experience and mine. We can see the corraboration, and parallels. It solidifies, and validates. THANK YOU For sharing. [

And I will pay more attention to the things I do and accept them for the experiences that they are. [

 Sweet_Celestial_Sounds,
 <br>
 <br>
  Oh wow! I essentially got the same message, several times, that names weren't necessary. This kinda bugged me until it became apparent that identifying them, by what I now call 'their unique feel', was what I was suppose to focus in on anyway (I ended up nicknaming them because it's almost impossible to later write who I've been with by trying to describe their feel). And every visit with them always means I come away feeling as if I've been with true friends...and I have such a sense of well being and wonder.
  <br>
  They are just a thought or intent away: yes, couldn't agree with you  more...and just my 2 cents but I feel they are ever-present...it's just a matter of us learning how to tune into them, anytime we want.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks for sharing your experience and much love,
  <br>
  <br>
  Ginny

An writers ability is often times diminished by using a computer.  Many of the great authors still use pen and paper.  The creative process seems to work better for them.  I could explain how this would pertain to using CDs but I think you get the point.

Thank you so much for you reply and advice. To tell you the truth, it's gotten to the point that even the keyboard is to slow for me. Thoughts and knowledge flow through me so readily that if I had to write with paper and pen it would not a good situation at all. [

I was thinking about fiction writers when I wrote but my real point was that if one uses "aids" to achieve certain things they can possibly cheat themselves out of a great learning experience and the experiences along the way.  On the other hand I can see the benefits.

  Cosmic D,
  <br>
  <br>
  ~Hey. How do you experience your Source Self? (Moen calls it his disc.)~
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  At first, while in a small park-like setting I create in Focus 27 a few years ago, I guess I felt a need to experience them with what I was comfortable with: human/physical manifestations/5 physical senses...so they presented themselves in form. I still enjoy this premise but I now rely a lot more on what I feel (as you so beautifully stated, they each have their own essence signature) to know who I'm with, to understand any communications, etc. I have 'seen' them grouped together as a gray-whitish mass with a few individuals close to me temporarily in human and animal form, as well as several appearing as bright,gold-white orbs, or humanoid forms filled with energy and so on. The more I move away from thinking I need to use the 5 physical senses or carbon copies of such sensing while There, and instead open up to feeling their frequencies or essence, the better I'm able to 'tune into' them and experience all that happens within receiving and sending rotes. And, if I understand your experience correctly, Darryl...that's exactly what you did? It's like, you didn't spend a lot of time having to experience them in form, or in a human/earthly sense---you just leaped over all that and went more to their truer state of being? Wow!!!! Congratulations!
  <br>
  <br>
  Something else I've been experimenting with is, while conscious and relaxed, eyes open, I bring to me that daydreaming feeling state...and then ask them questions. It's fun...and interesting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's all so very simple, isn't it?
  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Looking forward to more posts from you!---:o)
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Much love,

Yes. It's very fun to have converstions with them all the time. And it's like what is done with the putting of energy into the Core Cyrstal. We are helping to beild a bridge, and link- a stronger one- so that it is easier and easier for us and for those that follow us to do the same, to reach the higher, in whatever fashion they choose.
