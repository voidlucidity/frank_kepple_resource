<section>
hello to the people
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
yesterday morning i woke up  directy to the projection process,   i could feel a  segment of my brain throbbing and the more i focused on it, the more intense the process became,  (e.g  noises and  vibrations)  but i changed position to my back and i couldnt get it again,  i beleive i definatly would have projected if i never moved.
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
<br>
<br>
i think Frank has spoke about this "brain method"  before.
<br>
<br>
so on the night i decided to skip my usual energy raising work but instead,  focus  on my brain and try to "look" for that part of my brain which triggers the process.  I never actually got it but  still, after about 5-10 minuites i  felt intense vibrations and energy surges which lasted for about 20 minuites,  which is much quicker than my usual process - THEN i did energy raising etc
<br>
<br>
other people should try using  M.B.A  and focus on the brain,  it got me into a trance 40 minuites quicker than how i used to do it.  Hold your focus there until  all of a sudden the vibrations just *start*
<br>
<br>
<br>
once i am in this intense vibration stage,  how do actually get out???    the rope method seemed harder when i feel the vibrations.

<br>
Yes, now you are really making good progress! Problem is you moved and spoilt it.
<br>
<br>
I recently found the head vibrations begin as a very light mental swishing feeling. Like someone was stroking my brain with a feather, every second or so. Then I start to get a zump... zump... zump about twice a second, which feels like a portion of my brain is contracting and releasing. These contractions become faster to the point where it feels like you are vibrating.
<br>
<br>
Allow yourself to bathe in the vibrations and they get more and more refined, i.e they get to a higher pitch. At some point you will simply move away from the Physical and make your entrance on the Astral. Oh, and at some point too you should automatically get your Astral sight.
<br>
<br>
One good way I found of getting your focal point of awareness upwards, is to imagine that, at either side of your head at the temple region, is a ping-pong bat. And you keep knocking the ball from one side to the other about once or twice a second. Then create two small awareness hands and have them massage your forehead and temples.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I started doing is have an imaginary short length of string with a weight on the end. Take one of your awareness hands and imagine it is situated vertically in the top middle of your head. Then have it hold the non-weighted end of the string and start spinning it around so the weight flings out and spins horizontally.
<br>
<br>
Another one is to take the same hand and string and hold the hand horizontally, so the fingers are facing the inside of your forehead, and start the weight spinning like a propellor.
<br>
<br>
If you continue with one thing too long your attention shifts. So keep rotating each set of imagery every minute or so. There will come a point where you suddenly realised you forgot all about your physical body and you find yourself either remotely viewing some Astral scenary, or you begin feeling the contractions in your head.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank  by higher pitched vibrations do you mean  they become sharper and/or smoother  instead of  the intensity of "average" vibrations,  i am going to assume you do for the time being.
<br>
<br>
I had the contraction in my brain feeling,  but it wasnt the same part of my brain as it was in my morning experience so i quickly shunned it as being  the wrong part of my brain to focus on, although ill focus on it next time.
<br>
<br>
Does this method project you to the astral plane or real time zone??
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to shift between the A.P  and the R.T.Z  whilst  projecting?
<br>
<br>
If when i gain astral sight i think "wow ive got astral sight"  it will surely fade away...yes??
<br>
<br>
i did not hear the incredible noises like i did in the morning last night,   do the noises imply i am closer to projecting?

They become higher pitched and smoother. At first the vibrations can feel like you are sitting on an unbalanced spin-dryer that's turning at full speed. Once you get more proficient at bringing them on, they quickly smooth out.

<br>
<br>
The real-time zone is an Astral plane, but I realise what you are saying. I found that if I let the vibrations smooth out slowly, whilst gently thinking about rocking from side to side, at some point I flop out into the real-time zone. If you let the vibrations refine further you automatically move away from the Physical and project within the Astral.

<br>
<br>
Yes, very possible. There are various techniques that involve shooting off at high speed in the real-time zone and ending up within the Astral. With me, I suppose, because the Astral is where I would normally project to, I only have to think about being there and I automatically transport somehow.

<br>
<br>
The noise you hear is just stray energy that just seems to come and go at random (with me, anyway). Because of that you cannot really imply anything from it.
<br>
<br>
When I manage to do a really smooth and controlled conscious exit (cannot do that all the time, yet) I neither hear nor see any stray-energy at all.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.

<section>
Is it necessary to go back to the body first or is it possible to go into the real-time near-physical area from the astral planes? It sounds easy to go from the real-time zones to the astral, but so far nothing has been said about how to reverse the process. If it can be done, then how to pick a specific location?

<section>
<br>
<br>
Yes it most certainly can be done. But as to how to pick a specific location is escaping me at the moment. Basically, my navigation skills suck and I'm currently working on changing that.
<br>
<br>
As the Astral encompasses the Physical, it should be possible to travel, say, to the moon within the Astral and then simply plop out into the moon's RT-zone and go walkabout (or any other planet for that matter).

Frank   do you ever focus on just your brow chakra as opposed to the  whole crown of your head head to get out?
<br>
<br>
i find it much easier to focus on my brow chakra  than my whole head.
<br>
<br>
if your not farmiliar with chakras the brow chakra is between your eyebrows

<br>
Yes, though, Astral travel uses a combination of both. I talked about this in a recent post reference my two newly developed methods of projecting: there's my "step in" projection and my "travelling" projection. The post was quite recent so should be an easy look-up.

Your brain isn't actually contracting, it just feels that way. Some of the sensations you get can feel uncomfortable, at first, until you become accustomed to them.

I have tried the techique months ago, with some interesting results, only to have had forgotten about it since then.  Was reminded of it in a post from Pete, about an 'eject button for the soul'.  Will definitely try it again tonight though.
<br>
<br>
Have you any more progress to report on this?
<br>
Any little details to add to the technique?

<br>
When originally posting to this thread I was working on stimulating what Mystics call the Crown Chakra, and trying a number of ways of getting my focal point of awareness away from the back of my physical eyes and point it upwards into the expanse of my mind.
<br>
<br>
This was prompted primarily from my research into the question of where, exactly, do the "vibrations" come from. Regulars will have heard me talk about what I call my cannonball-exit; a projection experience characterised by a sudden feeling of intense vibration, followed by the sensation of exiting the Physical with a force like I had been shot from a cannon. So I set out to try and slow down this process in an attempt to find out what was happening.
<br>
<br>
I discovered the vibrations began very subtly from a point at the crown of the head: right where all the mystical drawings and charts depict the placement of what is termed the Crown Chakra. From further research, I have now found it possible to be able to focus inwards and, given the right conditions, I can activate the Crown Chakra
<i>
 even while still having some awareness of my physical body together with my physical surroundings
</i>
. Although this is still very much easier said than done.
<br>
<br>
Activation begins first with a subtle mental "knowing" feeling that tells me I hit on the right place within my mind. And this bit is the real tricky part. Because from then on it feels like an automatic process takes over. Following this "knowing" feeling comes a short phase where I feel like I am experiencing vibrations, but I'm not actually experiencing them. It's sort of like I'm beginning to mentally tune-into them. For a while this was a tad confusing. Until the penny dropped and I realised that the vibrations were something that were always there, and not something that we create. In other words, we don't in some way "manufacture" this vibrational state. It's more something that we mentally tune-into by focusing our awareness in a particular direction.
<br>
<br>
Next, I get a kind of mental swooshing feeling like someone just stroked my brain with a feather. This happens every couple of seconds or so. Then I relax into this further and the swooshing feeling turns into a mental vibration that occurs about once per second. Now, at this point, if I relax into it further then the vibrations increase in frequency and intensity and I lose all sensation of my physical body.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Frank

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for this latest methodology - it makes alot of sense as the Crown and Brow Chakra's together with the Heart Chakra are the most important points of higher focus. The lower triangle of Chakras are more grounded, which is not the objective for Astral projection.
<br>
<br>
With apologies if I have overlooked another post on this, would you mind summarising this latest "Crown Chakra" method of yours from the beginning as a complete working Astral projection method? Also, is this a method for anytime, or is it best to wake up early morning with full relaxation and half trance state and work from there?
<br>
<br>
An indication as to how long the process takes from start to Astral would be most useful as well - I think some people tend to get frustrated to quickly if things don't happen very quickly. There has also been much discussion on lying position - many people say that OBE is really only possible - reliably at least - while lying on the back rather than the side - this seems quite a common observation.
<br>
<br>
Also - has this evolved beyond and to supercede your Monroe type phasing method, or are they connnected in some way?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for a most useful and interesting contribution!

I was just trying the Brain Method last night, just to see if it would do any good. And I was suprised and shocked of how effective it was. So much that I startet to laugh and had to abort [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
].
<br>
<br>
First I startet off by just lying on my back in my bed breathing in and out slowly for a few minutes. Then I moved my awareness to the inside of my brain. I tried to center it so that it would be paralel to my Brow Chakra. And after a while with just trying to find the right position, it just setteled there. After that everything pretty much went on its own. I could feel some contractions in my forehead, my Borw Chakra started activating as all hell, and the vibrations started comming in stronger and stronger, to the point where I almost could'nt feel my body anymore. I aborted cause I was laughing and I was'nt realy prepared to AP.
<br>
But all of this happened in just about 5min.
<br>
That is amazing!
<br>
<br>
Im gonna try this again, and so should YOU!(who ever reads this)[8D]

Adrian: What I am currently practicing has evolved out of my Monroe studies. Initially I set out to slow down what was my normal "cannonball exit" by following the Phasing method as taught by Monroe. After a while I did get to the stage where I could go through the phasing transition in a controlled way. Though I still can't just do this at will.
<br>
<br>
I prefer practicing early morning as it's quieter and my body is refreshed following a night of sleep. As for length of time, it can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to around two hours to get to the requisite state. Typically, results come within 45 mins. Once in that state I generally have two or three projections in succession, with a break inbetween to make notes as necessary.
<br>
<br>
Normally I lay on my back for projection practice and on my side for sleep. Though in my experience the effectiveness is no different between the two. I just make the distinction as a clear signal to myself as to what is on the agenda: projection-practice or sleep.
<br>
<br>
As to why some mornings it's like I just fall into it and others it takes me a couple of hours, is a question I've been working on for about two months. Basically, it looks like it just comes down to getting into a working routine followed by lots of practice.
<br>
<br>
When I first started out on the Phasing route I was trying all kinds of things, from all kinds of angles, to try and work out what Monroe was going on about. Now, I've boiled it all down to just one working routine which I stick to religiously. Since doing that the number of successful attempts has increased significantly.
<br>
<br>
I've said before that I've got no natural talent for any of this, which means it always takes me a lot of time to make progress. So perhaps I'm not the best yardstick to use when it comes to estimating the typical lengths of time people need to practice the various stages before getting results. The Phasing approach I've been practicing virtually every morning for about a year. A practice session I make 1.5 hours minimum. Often I'll extend this but pushing myself too hard I found counterproductive.
<br>
<br>
My current routine begins with going through the Gateway rundown to Focus 10 and back to C1. Technically, I don't really need the CD anymore as I know it off by heart after listening to it so many times. But I find it has the effect of getting me nicely in the mood, so to speak. Then, upon my return to C1, I'll decide whether or not to begin the session proper.
<br>
<br>
It may have been that during the CD rundown I was disturbed by something or other and it didn't go according to plan. Maybe I felt the need to use the toilet, or perhaps my wife was a little restless, or whatever. In which case I'll go through the CD rundown again. Note: I found it counterproductive to begin a session that didn't feel good from the start. So if there is a problem then I cancel the session, sort out whatever it is and start afresh.
<br>
<br>
So, on deciding to progress, I'll got through the rundown to Focus 10 without the CD only this time I'll carry on through to the higher Focus levels. If I don't feel quite right for whatever reason, I'll listen to the CD one more time and then start the session proper.
<br>
<br>
The past couple of months I've developed a successful deviation from what was my normal Phasing practice; in that I have successfully married elements of my previous Cannonball-Exit to the Phasing process.
<br>
<br>
I reached the stage where I'd developed a degree of skill that enabled me to make the transition from Physical to Astral with a reasonable degree of predictability. Problem was, comparing my experience with the description Monroe gives of
<u>
 his
</u>
Physical to Astral transition: the two didn't match. The transition he describes sounded to me more like a combination of the traditional obe-style exit, followed by what I can now recognise as a smooth Phasing to the Astral. Also, quite a number of experiences he describes, for example viewing M-Band radiation fields, sounded very much to me like he was way out in the real-time zone, rather than the Astral proper.
<br>
<br>
As we know, Monroe originally set-out projecting in the traditional obe sense, and later developed the Phasing concept which he taught at TMI. So this gave me the idea that maybe Monroe's later projection experiences were somehow a cross between his old way and his later developed Phasing concept.
<br>
<br>
So I set out on the road of trying to take my previous, more traditional-style projection experience, i.e. feelings of vibrations, leaving the body, etc., and marrying them with my recently developed Phasing skills. As it happened, this turned out to be a highly successful step forward in my development.

I tried this method this morning and got a 'throbbing' sensation in my head, however I started getting it in TWO places, one near the top of my skull and the other somewhere in what felt like the right hemisphere!
<br>
<br>
Which to choose?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead I should focus on my brow chakra, as I feel sensations there quite often, even when I'm not involved in doing any energy work. Sometimes when I lie down to go to sleep I can feel it slighlty as I drift off. As it seems that my brow chakra seems to be naturally more activated in my case, do you think I could achieve astral states simply by working with this?
<br>
<br>
Also about focusing on the part of the brain - I was trying to 'feel' what part of my brain triggers vibrations. Is this right or do you actually have to move your entire sense of awareness ie your point of view up there; I would find that difficult, but I don't have much of a problem with concentrating on a certain part part of the brain, if that's what you mean.
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of firing up the old f27 mp3 soundtrack on my personal stereo again, as this would probably aid this process!

From what I have seen of the early Monroe methods, focussed at a point somewhere in front by about six inches I think it was. He then spoke about "reaching out for vibrations". Of course, based upon what we know now, "reaching out for vibrations" does not make alot of sense, as the vibrations originate within, but I it seems to me to be all about focussing awareness away from the physical body. Perhaps focussing on the brow chakra and out a few inches might help?
<br>
<br>
One thing that is
<b>
 extremely
</b>
consistent waking up early morning to project. Frank will no doubt correct me if I am wrong, but all of his methods involve this in one way or the other. Many methods involve waking early, getting up for 20 or 30 minutes and going back to bed again. This results in a Lucid dream or waking with vibrations.
<br>
<br>
The reason almost certainly is that the "body asleep" or deeply relaxed condition is absolutely fundamental to all Astral projection,and of course the body is naturally in that state after a night's sleep. After that it is a matter of allowing the body to drift back to sleep, while keeping the mind awake, and I am sure that focussing on the brow, crown and hear chakras is a way to do this.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

Adrian.

question....in the NEW energy system tutorials RB suggest that it is not a good idea to stimulate brow or crown chakra on its own as it can cause adverse side effects.....anyone ran into this or have any thought on this?  thanks in advance as I am curious...MBA sounds interesting!

<br>
<br>
I do tend to make clear, where necessary, that I am not into doing any kind of formal "energy work" or "chakra stimulation". Nor am I into any kind of "mystical work".
<br>
<br>
Plus, I don't want to get into a situation where RB says one thing and I'm saying the opposite. For what would seem, on the surface, to be a direct contradiction probably has a very normal and natural explanation.
<br>
<br>
All I can say is, after having experienced these vibrations for quite a number of years, I have suffered no ill-effects whatsoever. But it may well be
<i>
 within the context of conducting intensive "energy work"
</i>
to stimulate one "chakra" more than another could cause some kind of imbalance. I really can't say on that.
<br>
<br>
There is also the consideration the vibrations I have talked about in various posts, that I say begin at the crown of my head, may be nothing to do with any kind of "chakra" at all.
<br>
<br>
It's just that after studying the onset of vibrations very closely (I lost count of the number of times) they do begin from the same area in my head each time. This area is pretty much right about where all the mystical drawings I have seen depict some kind of energy-centre called the Crown Chakra. Plus, all the descriptions point towards this Chakra being a kind of gateway to the Astral realms.
<br>
<br>
Which is
<u>
 exactly
</u>
what I experience.
<br>
<br>
As the vibrations begin, I get a definite sensation of unhooking from the Physical and flying off into the RT-Zone. What seems like a few seconds later I enter the Astral realms. So it's exactly like once the vibrations begin a kind of "gateway" opens. Whereupon I take-off and fly through it.
<br>
<br>
This process I now know is basically the same as what used to happen with my old "cannonball exit" that I experienced for all those years. Only now, after extensive practice using the Gateway Wave 1 CD (as I posted about at length) I managed to slow the whole thing down to the extent where it all happens with a good degree of predictability and control - pretty much all of the time now.
<br>
<br>
I still cannot simply project at will. As I do need fairly exacting circumstances to be put in place. But once those circumstances come together, multiple projections come about that are predictable and readily controlled. Basically, I need to be in quiet surroundings where I am mentally fresh with little possibility of interruption. Which for me is early morning.
<br>
<br>
As regards the crown-chakra situation, my question is, if what I experience is happening not as a result of "crown chakra" stimulation, then what
<u>
 is
</u>
being stimulated?
<br>
<br>
Also, it could well be there are varying degrees of stimulation coupled with varying sensations. Though I can say categorically that I never experienced any kind of "pain". I've experienced (and continue to experience) all kinds of very whacky and highly unusual feelings. Which do become rather fun to have, once your protective sense of awareness becomes used to accepting them as being normal. But never anything I could remotely describe as pain.
<br>

hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I found your comments really interesting, because the pain i feel is such a regular effect that I just assumed everyone felt it. You posted last week about acupuncture. Can I ask whether you have felt pain from acupuncture stimulation? I don't mean the pain of sticking needles in your body, of course. I get acupuncure very regularly (I'm a student of chinese medicine) and almost all the time I get a dull ache in and around the site of the needle. This is one of the several possibilities that we learn is a sign of good qi stimulation. It only occurs to me now that perhaps when I feel pain it is a sign of energy moving through a blocked area (as RB says, strong energy sensations indicating blockage). The sensation I get when doing your method (dull, heavy, throbbing pain) is identical to the sensation from acupuncture. I also get the same sensation sometimes when I use NEW on my hands.
<br>
<br>
What I'm thinking is that this is indicating that I am getting good energy stimulation, but the area is too blocked to fully activate to the point where it will trigger the vibrations and exit. Any thoughts on this?
<br>
<br>
cheers,
<br>

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I'm working on the "brain method" and could you explain the evolution of the sensations, feelings, up to the projection.
<br>
<br>
On working the brain as you wrote, (ex: the ping pong ball from temple to temple etc...) I will get a feeling of tighness, or congestion, is that also your experience ?
<br>
<br>
From there what happens next, step by step ? Where does the feeling of being stroke by a feather comes in ?
<br>
<br>
This will help in knowing if I'm progessing in the right direction.
<br>
Also you lately wrote about the crow area, do you work that area in the same manner as the brow (ping-pong), and does the area of stimulation as to be precise, pin pointed, or just the general area ?
<br>
<br>
Thank you

Originally, it came about from reading Monroe's JOB over 20 years ago. I posted a while back about how I came across this book by chance, and thought the guy was either insane or had caught onto something. I gave it a fair go and, to my surprise, began getting projection symptoms. The cannonball-exit came about as a result.
<br>
<br>
At the time, I considered this rather violent projection experience to be how it was, so to speak. After all, I didn't know any different. It is only relatively recently I started taking my Astral experiences more seriously and began trying to slow the whole process down to try and make more sense of it.

Unfortunately, as much as I would like to, I cannot really comment with any authority on your other questions as I'm not into doing any kind of energy-work... such as that described in RB's NEW system, for example.

<br>
<br>
Quebec: To be honest I don't know what the "brain method" is, exactly. Someone else coined the term which seems to have stuck.
<br>
<br>
A while ago I set off down a road which attempted to find an answer to the question, "Where do the vibrations come from?" They seemed to begin at the head, but with me they'd build in intensity
<u>
 so
</u>
quickly I had no chance to study them. So I began trying all kinds of techniques to try and somehow ignite these vibrations, but in a controlled way; hence the ping-pong exercise, and a few others, with which I had limited degrees of success.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, I was working on several imagination-based techniques, coupled with the Gateway Wave-1 CD, which I posted about at length. I developed these techniques to the point where I could fairly reliably Phase from Physical to Astral most mornings - without feeling any kind of vibrations at all. So I forgot about the question of vibrations for a while.
<br>
<br>
I thought that my later work had overwritten the older stuff: in much the same way as when you load a newer version of Windows, for example. The new version overwrites the old version to the extent where you can no-longer boot from the old program.
<br>
<br>
Lately, however, I got curious about the matter of vibrations again after re-reading Monroe's two later books: FJ's and UJ. It struck me that even though Monroe speaks about Phasing, he does describe feeling vibrations as well. So I set-out to try and form a mix between my new-found Phasing skills and my old cannonball-exit.
<br>
<br>
My attempts at doing this were surprisingly successful. Now, my projection experience follows pretty much exactly as Monroe describes. Though with nowhere near the same degree of reliability (yet). In Monroe's case he would project with such ease that many times he'd just simply want to sleep instead. (Oh, how I would dearly love to "suffer" this condition!)
<br>
<br>
Just thinking about experiencing vibrations, while undergoing the Phasing process, flicked a switch somewhere and I began to feel an inkling at first; after which they came back into the projection equation more and more. But somehow my later-developed Phasing skills had completely changed the nature of the way I experienced the vibrations. For a start, they began in a far more controlled way from about the Monroe Focus 21 state. And I discovered also they did in fact come about from a point at the top of the head each time.
<br>
<br>
From practice, I found I could trace their origins back further. I felt them begin as a tiny mental swooshing feeling like someone just stroked my brain with a feather. Since then, I traced the feeling back further still. The whole process begins with a simple mental "knowing" feeling; then a kind of mental null; then a weird sort of creaking sound; then the feather-stroking feeling.
<br>
<br>
The length of time at each of these stages can change slightly. I might get two or three mental null feelings, then maybe just one creaking sound, followed by several feather strokes; or just an inkling of a feather stroke, one mental null and several creaking sounds; or whatever combination of the three.
<br>
<br>
The mental Knowing feeling happens when my physical body has relaxed to the extent where my focal point of awareness has shifted from behind my physical eyes and is now focussed within the expanse of my mind. Though my latest studies do strongly indicate that the reverse is more the case, i.e. the act of shifting my focal point of awareness *is* what causes my physical body to duck-out of the equation. Which is something I've suspected for quite a while. But I've only recently been able to experience the onset of the process slow enough and reliable enough to make any kind of concrete sense of it all.
<br>
<br>
I found that shifting my focal point of awareness from behind my physical eyes to be the trickiest part in the whole process!!! It still presents me with quite a stumbling block and it's the last major hurdle I need to overcome. Problem is, it doesn't just have to shift: it needs to shift in a particular way. And that's the darned tricky part. Well, for me that is.

I no-longer use the original exercises. As outlined above, the Gateway work took over. When I recently came to think about vibrations again, they were far more controlled than previously.

<section>
Concerning the vibrations, it is now my opinion that the vibrations are in fact 'always on' but we are not aware of them. When we shift our point of awareness we slowly become aware of them, they feel more powerful as we focus on them.
<br>
I think this is what is happening with 'energy raising' techniques; there actually isnt any 'energy raising' going on as its always there anyway. Instead the technigues are designed to make you more aware of them.
<br>
In this way RB and others are not wrong in their ideaas about energy raising and they do work, but they may work in a slightly different way than described.

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank for your reply.
<br>
<br>
Once you have acquired the desired state with Gateway (Focus 10) how does it goes from there ?
<br>
<br>
Since you have gotten away from the exercices (ping pong etc...)what exactly do you do from there (Focus 10)? How does it evolves to the exit?
<br>
<br>
Is it just placing your awareness in the crow area for exemple, just looking at the brow to get the 3D blackness
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
I know that the essentials for OBE starts with relaxation and then to the body-asleep/mind-awake state. What happens from there ? Is it just staying in that state and the rest will evolve by itself to the vibrations and then the exit ?
<br>

<br>
<br>
As to your questions, I feel the process is not quite so cut and dried as you think. After a *lot* of practice I have pretty much reached the stage where I can hold myself at the various mental-focus states originally labelled by Monroe. Though please bear in mind I always said that I don't have any natural talent for this kind of thing. It always seems that each step takes me ages of trial and error. What I'm getting at is perhaps I'm not the best of yardsticks.
<br>
<br>
I doubt you will get to a position where you are at Focus 10 or Focus 12, and so forth, stuck as to what to do next. The process is largely one that starts flowing and will continue to flow if you let it. You see, a lot of the work I've been involved with is learning how to try and slow the process down. And the same has been true with a number of people I've been in contact with.
<br>
<br>
The various mental focus states come about like motorway signposts. In the sense that from Focus 10 you get a sensation of mental movement like you were travelling. As you travel you become enveloped with particular mental scenarios that have certain qualities about them. The tendency, I found, is people will generally either pass through a state, or get zapped out of it.
<br>
<br>
I no-longer think about placing my awareness in any particular region of my head. The simplest way I can explain it, is I just shift my focus of attention into the region of my mind. Okay, I still find that far easier say than to do. And it's one of the last remaining hurdles I face in my quest to project at will.
<br>
<br>
The key element to achieving this, I found, is getting your mental focus away from the backs of your physical eyes.
<br>
<br>
The Gateway Wave-1 CD acts for me now as a kind of mental primer. In that first I'll listen to it a couple of times, and go through a mental rundown of the like I describe in the sticky-post. This acts for me as a kind of mental stretching exercise. Just like dancers do, for example, to warm-up their muscles before a performance.
<br>
<br>
Oh, one mental rundown I found particularly effective is to imagine you are in a small audience and Monroe is facing you a short distance away, on a stage, verbalising the instructions.
<br>
<br>
Another exercise I often do is imagine a shape, any shape it doesn't matter. Perceive that shape in mind for a few seconds then shift your focus of attention to the backs of your eyes. So you are looking at the backs of your closed eyes. Then shift your focus back to within your mind and perceive the shape. After a while you will perceive a distinct shift in focus. Once you recognise the shift, then practice holding the mental shift within the mind. This is a bit tricky because you'll probably have these little blank moments; during which your mental focus will slip to the backs of your eyes again.
<br>
<br>
Once you can hold that mental focus, next you simply feel what you are presented with. You might say, "Just blackness". But if you perceive more closely, you might get the idea that all is not quite jet black. Again, when I say "blackness" I'm speaking of a situation where you are not simply trying to focus on the backs of your eyelids and all you are seeing is some kind of residual vision.
<br>
<br>
You might perceive an area of greyness, or other areas that are lighter than black. These may seem to come and go at random. Once you become more adept at doing this, you will have fewer of those annoying little blank moments where your mental focus drops back. As such, there will come a point where these inner effects will capture your attention
<i>
 to the extent you are no-longer focussed on the physical body
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
This is Focus 10.
<br>
<br>
In other words, Focus 10 is basically the same state as when a person becomes engrossed by a movie on TV. Mental attention has been captivated to the extent where there is no-longer any sensation of the room the person is sitting in, the sofa they are sitting on, or their physical body which reclines on the sofa.
<br>
<br>
In obe terms, you are no-longer aware of the room you are laying down in, or the bed you lay on, or your physical body laying on the bed. Your entire mental focus has been captivated by what is going on within you, mentally. As I say, this is Focus 10.
<br>
<br>
Next comes Focus 12 where you will find that the areas of lighter than black become more distinct. The blackness can take on a velvety or a liquid quality, or you may perceive all kinds of other textures. You might perceive outline drawings of all kinds of shapes; or what seem like faces of people or animals; or whispy foggy colours that appear to swirl around you. As this scenario develops there comes a sensation of mental movement; a kind of forwards progression that takes you onto the next phase.
<br>
<br>
Each transition tends to be fairly seamless in that one will naturally flow into the other over a period of several seconds. However, at first, progress will probably be scuppered again by the physical eyes in that they tend to try and snatch glances of the various effects you are perceiving. Once you can get the eyes out of the projection equation, you should be able to effect a seamless and controled transition from Physical to Astral.
<br>
<br>
At first, though, chances are you might perceive a forwards mental movement and next instant you might see some fleeting Astral scene: at which point your protective sense of awareness kicks in and zaps you back to Physical. Which is frustrating, but at least it confirms you are making progress.
<br>
<br>
There can also come a period where you go through what is a frustrating phase of, "hindsight realisation". This is where a person enters, say, the Focus 12 state... but because it is all very unfamiliar they obviously cannot recognise it. Finding itself in unfamiliar territory, the protective sense of awareness promptly zaps the person back to Physical. At which point they suddenly realise, in hindsight, they projected to an unfamiliar state.

I think by moving your physical you shifted your astral body as well and it just lost connection. Sometimes when I experience myself splitting and I don't want to (like when I have to get up and go to work or feel too exhausted) I turn my body and the "sensations" go away.

What do you mean by that do you just imagine a little image of yourself inside your head?

Another informative post.. Thank you Frank!
<br>
<br>
Although by now I already know of the things you speak about in this particular post (mostly from you, partly from my phasing attempt yesterday - I'm not trying to phase today, I want to let that insect vision a bit more time to fade out, and it's the holocaust memorial day here, so there's an increased potential of negativity during the attempt (as my subconscious is not as cheerful as usually)), it's amazing how helpful can a reaffirmation be. For instance, the part about keeping your focus away from your eyes; even though it's quite obvious, both from logic and experience, it's nice and beneficial to hear someone experienced say that instead of just realizing that by yourself.

I sometimes try to visualize energy flowing in my animalistic or right brainn  hemisphere.
<br>
I am obsessed with harmony in the brain.

To me it represents paradise and perfection

I kinda chanced across this method (never heard of it until just now)while doing some sort of mind clearing meditation.
<br>
The way i reach the vibrations is just by concentrating on not thinking. I normally get the the state where i begin feel the vibrations very quickly (5-10 mins) but more often than not my mind ends up wandering without me realising.
<br>
I dont really focus on the brain but i do end up feeling a sort of tightness around the spot on the forehead where the third eye is supposed to be and somewhere right in the middle of the brain slightly towards the back.
<br>
<br>
Ive not managed to project yet. although its really only for the last week or two that i have been trying.

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
I am new to astral projection and am having some problems understanding the old monroe technique (I posted it in detail in the OOBE discussions forum.. the one from "Journeys Out of the Body") and was wondering if you could give me a technique of the brain method I could try.
<br>
<br>
I don't have gateway tapes or anything like that, and I always have a hard time visualizing and relaxing into trance (usually it helps to just sleep and then wake up 4 hours earlier, stay awake for maybe 10 minutes and then start to drift back off to sleep and enter hypnagogic state, though I am unsure of how to recognize I am in that state.. but I would probably just keep practicing an AP technique over and over again until I got some kind of response from it).
<br>
<br>
My road plan to learning AP is to first somehow induce the vibrations but so far I haven't found a technique that has worked except projection out of a lucid dream (which doesn't occur very often, and only lasts about 1-2 seconds).

hi all
<br>
<br>
i have never tried to AP before but have had a growing interest in it over the past year or so and have read many articles
<br>
<br>
i recently read your brain method(superb btw)
<br>
<br>
<br>
this is what happened on my frist attempt
<br>
<br>
firstly i started at my feet and visualised golden light coming from my feet they i worked up my body all the way to the head - once there the whole process started without any will from me - the buzzing the throbbing in my head above my right temple and then i felt as if i was out of my body but i had no sight - i was terrified then i felt myself go back i got a metalic taste in my mouth and i felt sick to my stomach i also felt heavy and had pins and neeles in my body
<br>
<br>
i was most aprehensive about what would happen and who i would see when i left  - this is ultimately what stopped me - can anyone advise on this - are there evil spirits etc lurking once you come of your body -are you protected in some way?
<br>
<br>
all thoughts and help appreciated
<br>
light and love to you all
<br>
<br>
CRLx
<br>
<br>
ps i was extremely surprised at how easy it was - is this normal?
<br>

Greetings Frank,
<br>
<br>
Apologies for continuing this one, but I would like to try and make this into a coherent method for phasing, one which is less complex than the TMI instructions and requires no hemi-sync.
<br>
<br>
If I remember rightly, with your original method you used to focus between your eyes, the brow chakra in mystical terms. Did you also focus on the top of your head, the crown chakra, or is this where the vibrations started?
<br>
<br>
When the vibrations did start, did they only extend as far as your head, or did they extend to your whole body?
<br>
<br>
I know you used to phase directly into the Astral, was this a smooth, seamless process where you suddenly found yourself in the Astral, and was the Astral envirnment totally solid and real, as per your current methods?
<br>
<br>
Apologies for the questions, but this does seem like an excellent method, and I just want to ensure nothing is left out.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

This sounds awesome.  I haven't tried the so-called "Brain Method" yet, but I also always feel a deep pressure on my brow, where the third-eye is, after a solid 30 minutes of deep relaxation.  I'm going to experiment tonight with Omega's color shift MIND AWAKE ORANGE/ BODY ASLEEP BLUE method.  I think together with more focus on the actual brow or crown chakras this might work out really well.  Not to beat a dead horse, but could anyone here suggest an exit method they have found to be easy to perform.  I haven't AP'd yet and I've been wondering if my exit technique has something to do with it. Thanks.
<br>

During meditation yesterday I focused all my awareness on my Brow Chakra and after awhile it started to kind of pulsate.  I know what vibrations feel like and it didn't feel like that, it was kind of a low rumbling sound.  It didn't spread to the rest of the body and I didn't try to move it around.  It just kept up that steady pulsating, it was not the heartbeat either.  Anyone have any idea what this could be and exactly how I should handle it next time? Thanx.
