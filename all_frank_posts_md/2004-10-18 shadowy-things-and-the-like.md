I'm not entirely sure which forum to put this in.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes while I'm meditating or trying to fall asleep, I see shadowy things and lights racing around my room.  I'm not sure what they are, but they seem harmless and they never give me a bad feeling.  I imagine they're always there but I'm able to see them only when I'm in an altered state.
<br>
<br>
Is there any way to make them go away or not be visible?  Normally I ignore them, but sometimes they are very distracting.  I keep thinking that someone has come into the room, or that a mouse is loose, etc., and lose my focus.

Sounds to me like you are entering the Focus 12 state (in Monroe terms). Here it is normal to see the kinds of things you mention.

I've actually never studied Monroe's work.  What are the things I'm seeing?
