Well, i had no idea there were such dedicated forums to astral projection and other metaphysical topics.  I've been looking into astral projection for the past year and, I believe, recently i had my first OEB!  I am currently reading Mastering Astral Projection and am just wrapping up Week 1.  I'm having a bit of trouble with the energy stimulations though.

Would it be OK to ask in this thread?  Or would it be more appropriate to ask in another topic?

Well I'll post here just to see if anyone else is having the same problems as I am.  Currently, i am attempting the energy work on the toes, tonight is feet.  When I was doing the energy work on my thumb, i had trouble figuring out how to flex my joint.  This contributed to me not "noticibly sparking acctivity" in my thumb.  The only feeling i got was the feeling you get when someone scratches a chalkboard in my thumb.  And i got that feeling from imaging a pipecleaner going in and out of my thumb.  The thought was odd feeling.  Same goes for my toes.  I beleive i unlocked my toe next to my big toe as it felt very heavy and tingly.  But as far as the thumb and other toes, i dont know what to do.
