hello everybody!
<br>
i am neosaturn, and as you may have guessed, i am new and rearing to AP.
<br>
<br>
first off i have a few questions. what is kundalini? i found it on lime-wire and it is kind of odd, second i need help with the "vibratory phase" on my AP's.
<br>
<br>
i have had one for sure AP, and a possible AP (it may have been a dream) and i almost did an AP the other day without sleeping. sleeping is the way i did it before, but lately i have found it nearly impossible to have an obe in my sleep like i originally did,, but then i came across this site in my journey to do a successful AP again, so i joined up.
<br>
<br>
PS. if you know me pretend that you don't!

Yours,
