<section>
I am currently reading
<i>
 Journeys Out of the Body
</i>
and although the book is a little out dated, I have found it quite fascinating and full of good info.  Anyway, for those of you who have read it (and can remember), I have a question specifically regarding the chapter he dedicates to "Local III"-
<br>
<br>
For those of you who haven't read it and those who have but long ago, Monroe finds himself traveling through tunnel into a black void.  Eventually he finds an entire world like ours, with a cilvilization much like ours (with human beings, etc.)  The main difference is the technology is different, ie. trains that don't use steam or electricity, but something stored in "vats".  The automobiles are very wide and sit up to six people on wide benches and drive down very wide streets.
<br>
<br>
The strangest thing is that when Monroe travelled there, who would occassionaly take over the body of a man...  this man was an engineer and occassionaly he would be in control of his body during vital moments, for example once he found himself as this man in his labratory.  Suddenly the man's wife entered the room with a group of people and asked, "So, can you tell my friends what you're working on?" Of course Robert, not having any memory of the man's past or present, other than the little info he had gained when he was in his body, didn't say anything.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Monroe admits to feelig guilty for having caused much embarrasment and anguish for the man...
<br>
<br>
What could this mean?  Do you think this was actually happening...that he was entering into another dimension, another world and actually interacting with real beings?
<br>
<br>
I found this chapter quite compelling...but sort of "Twilight Zone-ish".
<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think, expecially if you have read the book and remember this part.

G,day Dan,I vaguely remember that story &amp; I cannot refer to the book
<br>
as I have loaned J.O.B &amp; Far journeys to friends,whatever you do
<br>
dont loan them to people who are travellers.I,ve bought the 3 books
<br>
a second time around as a "friend" moved to Brazil &amp; took them with
<br>
him.I know where my new 2 are but Utimate Journey is goin on loan to
<br>
nobody!When I lend a series to a friend I only give them one at a time
<br>
now,instead of the whole series!Oh well ya live &amp; ya learn.
<br>
Greg &amp; Jo might be able to give you more info,but from what I know
<br>
of Monroe I believe he did encounter beings in different dimensions
<br>
&amp; possibly planets.I guess no one can really validate any of this
<br>
stuff in the physical,I just feel that from personal experience life
<br>
out there comes in strange forms &amp; I figure if I,ve seen &amp; felt
<br>
some of these things it seems plausible that R.A.M had seen much
<br>
more than I upon writing that book.He wrote that book the year I was
<br>
born 1971 so his experience by that stage must have been great,but
<br>
by the time he got to Ultimate Journey,he really had made sense of things.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys

A way to imagine such a thing to happen is this....imagine if you were temporarily out of your body and I was also temporarily out of my body...and for a few moments I was drawn to your body and ...maybe "entered it" is not the right terminology but...maybe if I "diffused" with your energy and what you were doing in that moment (like a colour slide being placed on top of another colour slide)and found myself in a situation of having to respond to  people around you (your family/loved ones/work colleagues...whatever...)it would be wierd giving them a correct answer or familiar gesture or whatever it was they expected/needed/wanted. Meanwhile, "you" are out of your body and perhaps experiencing a similar thing thru someone else's physical/mental/emotional body, also temporarily vacated ...whether thru involuntary astral projection whilst sound asleep or otherwise. Sounds wierd but it HAS been known to happen.  By the time Monroe wrote his third book, ULTIMATE JOURNEY,  he had a greater understanding of what was going on when he was out of his

<br>
Funny about you buying and losing so many copies of the same books Mobius! I don't know how many copies of "Journeys Out of the Body" and "Ultimate Journey" I've bought over the years. They've all disappeared into the same Circle-of-Friends- Black -Hole as yours....along with my multiple copies of The Only Planet Of Choice by Palden Jenkins !

Yes,my friends &amp; family think I,m a bit ruthless with my books now.
<br>
On lending out books now I say no folding the pages!no resting
<br>
cups/glasses/mugs on it!No writing on it or underlining or
<br>
highlighting anything!No opening the book past 90 degrees (to stop
<br>
cracks on the binding &amp; to keep closer to mint).
<br>
And only one set of Monroes so far has been lost,so I guess I got
<br>
learned!On the positive side we have probably had a flow on effect
<br>
from the people we have lent it to &amp; hopefully they passed it on &amp;
<br>
on &amp; on &amp; so on.
<br>
It feels good that some of these people I lent them to, said how much
<br>
they had loved this or that book,but it stated costing to much.
<br>
Ahhhhhhhhh the internet,sweet ,sweet internet.mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
<br>
<br>
Am I too ruthless? please say no!

Thanks for the info guys...I have actually read most of "Ultimate Journey" and it was very interesting (my secret is to simply check them out from the library).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Jo, do you really think while your out of body someone could enter yours?  Usually (nearly always) the individual is sleeping when OBE.  From what I understand, and I admit it's not a great deal, the only time someone could control my body, for example, is if I allow them to in some way.
<br>
<br>
All of the authorities on the subject generally claim that while OOBE,  the physical body is USUALLY asleep and thus even if someone entered it, what would they do, sleep for me?
<img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile_big.gif"/>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Monroe was/is a very interesting guy...I wouldn't mind knowing what he is doing in this very moment!

<br>
Peace!

Looks like another thing we share besides the Daniel,a good user of
<br>
the library.I,m not sure what it is like in other countries but here
<br>
&amp; the U.S.A seem to have access to some excellent books.
<br>
Most people dont realize the wealth of information at their
<br>
fingertips available for free!I,m a member of local &amp; state libraries
<br>
my uni library which covers 4 uni,s &amp; the national archives,all free!
<br>
I get video,s, c-d,s, meditation tapes,newspapers all free!
<br>
The things I really like &amp; stick in my mind I go to a bookstore &amp;
<br>
buy them.I like the old saying "work smart,not hard" .
<br>
I think society still gives the library a bad time &amp; associates it
<br>
with geeks.People like Adrian could probably testify that boys in
<br>
particular have a real "its uncool to be smart" attitude &amp; strength,
<br>
looks &amp; social standing are so much more important to them.

Good luck on your journeys

 Monroe's J.O.B. was the first ever book I read on this topic in about 1977. What I susequently realised from my studies, was the region he describes as "Local III" is simply the Astral realm.
 <br>
 <br>
 Problem is (as with any emerging science) we don't have many set terms for things. Some terms have been universally accepted now, like "Lucid Dream" for instance. Monroe called various areas "Locals". Some call them "Planes" I call them "Zones" and so forth.
 <br>
 <br>
 You see, just beyond the Lucid Dream stage there is what I call the Training Zone. Beyond which is what I term the Discovery Zone. The Discovery Zone is an infinite area that is populated by all manner of beings, including human-looking beings, engaged in all manner of activities. This is, I believe, where Monroe went when he describes the automobiles, etc. in a place he calls "Local III".
 <br>
 <br>
 I haven't read the book for some 15 years and no-longer have a copy so I cannot refresh my memory of what he wrote exactly. But it would be a mistake to think that "Local III" was just one area populated by one type of people. The number and types of beings and/or areas, etc. are truly infinite. However, if Monroe did believe there was just this one area, then that thought alone would be enough to keep transporting him back there.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the Discovery Zone you can generally approach people and ask all about what is going on. Hence why I use the term "Discovery". The other week, for example, I entered a huge building that turned out to be some kind of bakery. The other night I visited a social club where people were celebrating. Other times I just end up walking by a river, or just rambling across the countryside. Just recently I came across a large number of people who had met to watch a competition between these fascinating vehicles that had me enthralled.
 <br>
 <br>
 The most amazing thing I ever did was travel to an underwater area. Now that is very scary! It completely baffles your consciousness... the fact that you can go underwater without the need for any Scuba gear.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another amazing thing is sometimes the people you interact with actually know "what you are". When I went to the bakery, for example, I chatted to some people in a room that looked like a storage area of some kind. At first they were wondering who I was. Then one of them said to his workmate, "Ah, I think he's a xxxxxx... Yes, he is definitely an xxxxxx" Unfortunately, I cannot recall the word as my visit was cut short by my physical body pulling me back.
 <br>
 <br>
 Basically, there are two ways of visiting the Astra... 1) you can do as I do and just whoosh off and see where you end up. Or, 2) you can practise directing yourself to specific areas by using metaphysical imagery.

Frank I would have to agree with you on the terminology used in
<br>
OBE books &amp; hope future books will incorporate different methods &amp;
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///ideas.like" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
you I invented other names for places I frequented but
<br>
had never heard any one put a term like focus levels 10,12,15,21,30
<br>
&amp; was at first put off until I realized everyone was using
<br>
different names for the same thing.I had been having them since 6
<br>
years old &amp; tried to stop it as I didnt know what was going on &amp;
<br>
no-one seemed to know either.I vividly remember a time around 6 to 8
<br>
years old I had continous OBE,s when I went to bed.I would immediately
<br>
be transported to this very tall stair well inside a shopping centre,
<br>
where I would be at the top floor &amp; somehow get pushed into the open
<br>
to fall some 10 stories.This scared hell out of me &amp; set up insomnia
<br>
in my life but now I look back &amp; realize it was conditioning to
<br>
prepare me &amp; get me used to it &amp; after hundreds of times it happening
<br>
to me I just gave up fighting &amp; let go,I thought it meant death but
<br>
turned out to be far more exciting.Anyway when I read all these OBE
<br>
books I get this familiarity with places described but initial am
<br>
confused as to the terminology.

Thanks for the responses!  About the classification of different areas/zones/planes etc. -I agree that it's important yet maybe impossibile.  What do you all think about Robert Bruce's seperations/classifications (he makes them in OBE treatsie and AD)?

I need to come clean...although I have read everything from Bruce that's on the net, I have NOT read Astral Dynamics.  I just ordered it online (the autographed copy- have any of you ordered the autograph??- I thought it would be cool to show friends...) and am looking forward to pouring over it.
<br>
<br>
I agree with the fact that the lack of new age terms, etc. makes his work MUCH more accessible for the layman.  In fact when I finish it, I am going to pass it on to my father who doesn't know much, if anything, about OBE's, etc.
<br>

I am under the impression that AD is much like Robert's treatsie, just much more in depth and detailed...is this a true statement??

Well, I've been thinking more about this particular experience that Monroe had and have been trying to figure out why/how he could really take part in this other individuals life.
<br>
<br>
After reading Bruce's article about re-incarnation (found under the articles link on the hompepage-
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.astraldynamics.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.astraldynamics.com
</a>
) I have come to think that this other person is possibly himself, but in another time/dimension... read, or re-read this article by Bruce and I think you will know what I'm saying.  I am just hypothesizing here because this of course is all very hypothetical.

Hi Daniel,are you talking about in Monroes books how he says they

are his "I there,s" &amp; "I, here,s" &amp; INSPEC,s?Which all turned out to
<br>
be different aspects of himself.Some past aspects of himself,some

Ah yes,  I grew up on Monroe's books. I still read them when in the restroom, nice place to read...   The best thing that I think I got from the 3 Journey books are;
<br>
How wonderfully he approached the unknown, gentle and polite yet inquisitive and firm...  Trusting in others and willing to learn all that he could...
<br>
I admire this, and will use the same approach when I get there.

This is the second time that my reply will officially "ignite" my topic (you know, the nifty little fire/folder icon) and I think it's quite appropriate.  Every since Mr. Vaquez told us that "two heads are better than one" in my high school freshman "world history" class, I have been of the firm belief that getting others ideas, opinions, personal experiences, etc. about a thought or idea is a wonderful thing.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Monroe's work obviously speaks for itself, and it's nice to see that all of us agree that he was a true pioneer in the field of self-realization.
<br>
<br>
About the "I" here, there, etc.  I guess in the end he did realize that the "I" there was just exactly that... it's mind boggling.  I sure hope that the "I" somewhere else doesn't come here and start screwing up my life! j/k
<br>
<br>
Well, I appreciate all of the thoughts and ideas.  I am just finishing JOOTB and next I am getting "Far Journeys" which I heard is just as fascinating.  I read "Ultimate Journey" first, so I kind of did everything a little out of order...and actually it's turned out to be sort of a fun way of discovering what he did, although reading them chronologically would definetly have been much more true to how he experienced everything.

Hi all &amp; g,day Jo,sorry I,m not that original,I have been collecting
<br>
proverbs &amp; wise words spoken for years &amp; when friends send me emails
<br>
with proverbs or just good sayings I print them
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///out.one" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 out.One
</a>
day I,ll
<br>
end up with a book just on proverbs.Those ones I,ve been putting in
<br>
lately are obviously chinese proverbs,but none of this stuff has
<br>
been referenced,so I dont put an author next to those ones.I
<br>
love the ones in the various bibles as well &amp; must admit is the
<br>
only section I read regularly as anyone really could have said these
<br>
things &amp; they are just life experiences that nearly every human
<br>
understands at some time in their life.
<br>
I like comedy as well &amp; believe its such a valuable resource on our
<br>
planet &amp; try to remind myself &amp; others not to take life too
<br>
seriously.
<br>
<br>
Daniel,funny that,I started from Ultimate Journey &amp; worked my way
<br>
back.

Look, I really wouldn't place too much emphasis on the specifics of what Monroe wrote. Yes, at the time his JOB was brilliant. I will always have a soft-spot for "old man obe" as I call him, as JOB was the very first book I read. But a lot of the conclusions he came to about people being different incarnations of himself, and so forth? Well, maybe they were. But it is highly likely that they were not.
<br>
<br>
The BIG PROBLEM in coming to conclusions about Astral experiences is they can SO VERY EASILY become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact of which seemed to have escaped Mr Monroe. But I'm not holding that against him because it is SO darned easy to get carried away with it all.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I personaly found these strange experiences of Monroes to be a bit of a turn off as "I" cant relate to them and see them as a bit manifested.[I agree with you Hephaestus]
<br>
But "I" dont know!
<br>
There are credible people who channel spirits and this I can not relate to either.Mabey this guy had the ability to channel unknowingly and Monroe was simply drawn to him like a magnet.
<br>
I must say if this is the case unlike most people who claim to channel this guy was certainly unlucky as he was made out to be a toatal and complete fool from what I can recall.Monroe should have felt guilty!
<br>
<br>
P.S,its been awhile scince i've read Monroes works and though I liked him I feel theres better work out there today.However he will always have pioneer status.I'll probably read through his works again someday.
<br>
<br>
Peace,Andy

 The most amazing thing I ever did was travel to an underwater area. Now that is very scary! It completely baffles your consciousness... the fact that you can go underwater without the need for any Scuba gear.

<br>
Besides that I now consider Monroe's 1st book to be one of the most profound and clear books on the subject, I want to comment on this experience by Frank. Usually scary experiences in the astral comes from emotional states, but...
<br>
<br>
What puzzles me is that Frank feels that it is
<i>
 very scary
</i>
to travel to an underwater area. But don't we all _not_ breath when OBE? Why is this
<i>
 very scary
</i>
to Frank?
<br>
<br>
Do any of you know anything about this underwater area?

He didn't realize that at the time.
<br>
His belief system still included the fact that if you go underwater you require oxygen to survive.
<br>
<br>
It wasn't until he was force to shed that belief that the fear went away.
