This company are giving away free alienware machines, you may choose between either an Area-51™ 5500 Alienware Gaming Machine, a Sentia™ 3200 Alienware Gaming Laptop or an Aurora™ 5500 Alienware Gaming Machine.
<br>
<br>
This system really does work, freind of mine has an Area 51 5500 having already generated 30 referrals and he is now working towards a Sentia laptop. After seeing the result myself i'm working on 3200 Alienware Gaming Laptop.
<br>
<br>
All you have to do is follow the link below and sign up for a free account, there is a fuller description of the giveaway on the website. Then try one of their sponsors offers (These are typically online casinos where you have to make a single bet to register you have completed the offer.). As i witness my freind's Area 51 he had to make a £10 bet on betfair and that was it.
<br>
<br>
Once you have completed your offer, you get 25 or 30 people to do the same (depending on your choice of free gift) and then you have your machine, they even pay the p&amp;p!

Convince 30 people to do the same? It's f***ed up and it's a pyramid scheme.
<br>
Do such things to get a computer? It's sad to see that some people value their honor less than some silly computer, and that's in times when complete computer with good parameters(300mhz cpu is enough for nearly everything) can be bought for 100$.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I'm locking this thread as we do not allow pyramid schemes to be promoted here. I'm sure there are many, many websites devoted to this kind of thing. Primarily, we are an Astral Projection forum and this kind of presentation is not what we are about. No offence and all that. It's just that no matter how loosely we interpret the rules, we cannot incorporate this here.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Frank
