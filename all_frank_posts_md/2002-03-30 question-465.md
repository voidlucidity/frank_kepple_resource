I was wondering if anyone has ever been in an obe, and returned to the body and spoke directly to someone in the same bed.
<br>
May sound confusing, but i commanded myself to return to tell my partner all about my obe, i returned to the body and turned and spoke.
<br>
<br>
I didnt wake first, shake my head, then speak, it was one process.
<br>
Any ideas?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

 Yes, this is what you should train yourself to do with every experience you have. Doing this will enable you to remember more of the experience, and it will encourage you such that you WILL make faster progress. People who have difficulty with obe's generally do not endeavour to make bedside notes of their experiences HOWEVER SLIGHT. So if you haven't done so already, put a pen and notepad beside your bed. Make a habit of going back to the physical and immediately arise then jot down a few notes of your experience.
