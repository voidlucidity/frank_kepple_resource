<section>
I was not sure where to post this. I thought the general area was as good as any. If this needs to be moved to a more appropriate place then feel free.
<br>
Can anyone tell me if there are any particular techniques they use to help aid in weight loss/ increased metabolism other than a physical regime?
<br>
I am interested in learning ways to increase my awareness to make changes mentally. Is there such a thing to practice to change us physically? Weight? Hair Loss? Cancer?
<br>
Please share your thoughts and ideas.
<br>
<br>
Thanks

<section>
Your body is designed to stay the way it is. It can compensate better than you can apply pressure. Why do you think it is that so many people who go on diets eventually weigh more than when they began? If you want to change the way your body functions and the normal settings it tries to maintain, you have to approach it through the subconscious mind. You have to speak to the subconscious mind by using emotions. If you try to influence the body directly, it will resist. Your mind will just be one more outside factor for your body to compensate for. Follow the proper chain of command instead.

Tom-
<br>
<br>
Not exactly sure I follow. I read that you are saying I would need to change through the subconscious. Can you explain more on how I would go about doing that? Is there a certain technique that would be better for this? I am confused!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I was wondering what is it, exactly, that you are trying to do?
<br>
<br>
You mention weight, hair-loss and cancer. Now, that's a pretty wide deviation in the general scheme of things.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Yes there is. It's called affirmations.
<br>
<br>
We ultimately choose the things that come into our lives, and the things that happen to us. We all have the ability to make changes in our lives, even radical changes through re-affirming on a daily basis what it is we want to have happen.
<br>
<br>
People might think that affirmations are like a sugar pill, but it really is true that our thoughts have much power over our physical world. If we direct our thoughts in negative ways, we experience much negativity. If you know someone who is habitually pessimistic, have you ever noticed how bad things always seem to happen to them? If we direct our thoughts in positive ways, we experience positive things.
<br>
<br>
A good friend of mine, a tall slender lady, eats huge meals, doesn't exercise much, and makes no apologies for it. Her regular affirmation? "I am fit and healthy and I am the perfect weight for my height." Her mind, her affirmations, have set in motion the conditions needed in her life for her to maintain a healthy, and to be honest, simply gorgeous figure.
<br>
<br>
A very close friend of my sister-in-law was in hospital for most of her teenage years with Leukemia. She'd lost count of the number of times doctors had told her she only had about a week to live. She refused to accept this. She told them "no, I am going to live and be well."
<br>
10 years later she's still in complete remission with no trace of leukemia in her blood.
<br>
<br>
Now, the big trick with affirmations is to be careful with the wording and keep it positive, leaving out things like don't, can't, won't. In other words, don't affirm what you DON'T want to have happen, as that's what's going to be foremost on your mind, so that's what you're likely to get. Affirm what it is that you DO want to have happen.
<br>
<br>
It's no big secret that the words "I AM" play such an imortant role in religious texts like the Bible. These two words are possibly one of the most powerful creative forces known. When you start an affirmation with I AM, you are telling the universe that what you are saying is FACT, that IT IS, and you'll find the universe will have a tendency to believe you.
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

<section>
James and Runola thanks
<br>
<br>
Frank- At the forefront of my trouble is my weight. I just cannot seem to take it off. I had always been a bit overweight growing up. I am in now in my mid 30's and a few years ago my weight really increased. I decided I had better get to exercising. I have now been exercising on a regular basis (4-5 days a week) both cardio and weight training for a year and a half. I have lost a good amount of weight but the weight loss has stopped and has remained stopped for about 8 months. I have changed my routine countless times.
<br>
So, my question comes from that mostly. Is there anything I can do in addition to the exercise and diet?
<br>
<br>
Make sense?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Regards

<section>
Definitely agree with what Runlola's said.
<br>
<br>
Your body will find a point that it considers to be a healthy weight for what it's going through at that time. Listen to "society" less and listen to what your own body is telling you more.
<br>
<br>
Also consider that your excercise may have got you at a point where the fat is decreasing, but the muscle mass is increasing. Muscle weights more than fat, so if you really want to keep on toning up, measure your progress with a tape measure rather than the scales.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
James.

Hi
<br>
<br>
Does this mean you can change, say for argument's sake your hair colour or eye colour? I watched an episode of Horizon once on the BBC last year, backing this idea up, you can *think* yourself thinner or stronger.
<br>
<br>
It was all to do with the brain cells and their connections to each other. They carried out and experiment where a gymnast was struggling to complete this complex routine and she was told to sit down, relax and close her eyes and go through the routine again and again in her mind. They called it Visualisation. After ten minutes of this, she tried it again and succeeded.
<br>
<br>
What do you think?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your response. Lola makes an accurate point and under the circumstances it would appear sensible to look at what, exactly, you define as a "diet".
<br>
<br>
When you say "weight" I weigh a little more than I should for my height, in an average sense, because I carry more muscle on my frame than the "average" and muscle weighs a darned sight more than fat. So my question is, and I realise this is rather personal, but what I am wanting to know is what, exactly you are attempting to do?
<br>
<br>
If you are exercising to any degree then you will be gaining weight not losing it as exercise produces more muscle, all things considered. Unless you are just doing cardio then, if you are restricting your calorie intake, you will lose weight or gain it if not. Too much cardio is not a good thing I have to say. It places a tremendous load on the body and, in it attempting to gear up for the next "onslaught", it can go into a mode where it starts hoarding fats where it can.
<br>
<br>
People who are overweight, in a fat sense, when they exercise lose a lot of fat initially but then start to gain muscle weight so the weight-loss tends to taper off, but the body begins to develop a lot of tone.
<br>
<br>
To advise you properly I'd need to know your basic stats: height, weight and body-fat percentage. Plus your age and a bit of history of the past, say, 10 years, coupled with your goals for the future. If that's too personal then a PM would be best.
<br>
<br>
There are a few drugs that my old bodybuilding buddies would swear by. Clenbuterol is a nice cutting drug (fat loss) they would tend to use when competition-time approached. It's an oral so no sticking pins in your butt. Was never into that scene to such an extent, but I picked up a thing or two milling with those guys. He he, they were something else.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
well, he did say he went to meet what would be called the most intellegent human alive. Â and when his guide or inspec as he called them took him to a person who he couldn't determine the sex of so he simply called it a he/she kind of interesting. Â From what he finds out this person has given up eating and sleeping... it's interesting. Â there are also the people from a long time ago and then the ones in the future that he meets that are somewhat the same... only they eat whatever they want whenever but they don't need to like we do. Â edit: although I wish I had first hand knowledge on this... but since I don't yet I'll go with what Mr. Monroe writes about in his books.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I've said this before on the forum that nourishment is a concept and eating is a belief construct that is directly related to that concept. The body has no actual need to consume food. It can derive all it's "energy" from its subjective source. The problem is with most people, including myself I freely admit, these kinds of belief constructs are SO deeply ingrained it would be next to impossible to get out of them. But by no means impossible for all.
<br>
<br>
Statistically speaking, there must be the odd one or two isolated cases of people who, for whatever reason, at some stage in their lives (I would imagine at an early stage) chose not to adopt the construct.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Does that mean that a number of things that we do are simply belief constructs, like sleeping... eating and a number of other ideas that people simply think would be impossible to go with out? Â is gravity a belief construct too... because I'd like to stop believing.
