Hi. I will make this quick as possible.  The other morning I woke up early and decided to try AP.  I have been trying nightly for awhile, but it is hard because my husband, bless his heart, snores..and I mean LOUD..Anyway, there I was lying in bed, windows were open, and the sun was going to rise soon.  I could hear some nature sounds from outside, and it actually was soothing..(anything is better than the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///snoring.lol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 snoring.lol
</a>
)
<br>
It was no time at all before my body was numb and I felt like a giant head..lol..I can't explain it any better..
<br>
Then I heard this bird outside and started to focus on it, the next thing I know I feel like I am floating sideways right outside.  This is where it gets kinda weird...I really felt like I was outside hovering by the 2nd floor window,I could hear the bird and now it was in front of me, but everything was dark, and I didn't want to open my eyes cause I felt my real eyes would open. (but yet I felt like I was outside at the same time) Does that make sense? I then was definatly back on the bed and opened my eyes.  It felt so real, like I floated outside..but...I don't know.  Was it just my imagination?  Oh, yeah..I also got the tingling and my heartbeat was real fast. Can anyone give me some ideas on what happened?
<br>
Thanks..[

You probably had a short ethereal projection. The only thing missing was sight and this essentially ended the projection. Some people try calling for "Clarity Now!" when they have trouble with sight while out of body. You might want to give that a try next time.

Ditto, sounds exactly like a short ethereal projection.
<br>
<br>
Also, the fast heartbeat sensation: did that come about afterwards in a Physical sense as a result of you becoming excited due to the experience, or did you feel it during the experience?
<br>
<br>
If it were the latter, this is a common feeling when the energy centre about the centre of the chest (heart Chakra) becomes active. You get a tingling sensation in the upper body and it feels like your physical heart is beating quite rapidly, but it isn't.
<br>
<br>
Lack of sight is very common in the early stages.

Hey Nay,
<br>
The "Clarity Now!" command worked on my first time "fully out", (only had that twice, that I know of), but it was odd because after the command I seemed to pop back into my bedroom and physical body for a second, and then I was back up in the air above the house, (where I'd been floating).  Happy hovering!

Now that you mention it, Frank, I do believe it happened when I got excited, then instantly I was aware of my heart.  I tried to get back into it but my young son woke up. I did say "clarity now"  but that was after I felt back in my body.  I should have said it while outside, probably would have worked!!
<br>
Thank-You all for the input[

I am going to try again in the morning, I'll let ya know how it went.
<br>
<br>
P.S. I now can say I totally understand, that you can't let yourself think about your "physical" or it snaps you right back. I should have just kept thinking about the bird.
