HI!
<br>
<br>
Here's something that occured to me this morning regarding the noises and scary sights that tend to appear before and during exit.
<br>
Maybe this is yet another blinding flash of the obvious but here goes.
<br>
<br>
Since that astral (reportedly, as I yet to visit it) is extremely responsive to our emotions and beliefs or rather expectations a big hurdle is to gain control over them.
<br>
Can we then think of the astral noise as an entrance exam? If we can conquer the fears and distractions caused by this noise we have a much better chance of actually being able to function in a purposeful manner instead of getting tangled up in our imagination.
<br>
So many have reported that after a more or less succesful entry into the astral/RT planes they've become distracted or frightened and promptly been injected back to their bodies. Are these cases where the poerson has managed to AP directly, skipping over or missing the actual exit?
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know whether the mastery of the pre-exit noise correlates with the clarity of the resulting OBE?
<br>

I've often said that learning to project is the *easy* part. Though, naturally, the sensations you feel act as a kind of taster for what is to come. But I think nothing can prepare a person for the sheer mind-boggling glory of the Astral. The true-Astral I mean, not mere emotional interplay.

<br>
But like you''ve several times it's enourmously easy in the astral to get tangled up in the emotional interplay. What I was going for with my suggestion is that by learning to control the emotional interplay, which I suspect causes the noises, we are much better prepared to handle the pitfalls once we get to the astral proper.
<br>
Master the trasitional part and you get the astral as it is instead of as you think it should be.

<br>
Yes, you make a good point. But again I think nothing can actually "prepare" you for the full glory of the Astral. It's out of this world... literally.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck with your training.

<section>
I totally can see how nothing on the physical can prepare us but I do think it's possible to lay a good foundation that will make it much easier to assimilate the astral experiences.
<br>
<br>
Over the years as I've struggled with my beliefs and views of the world I've come to believe that there is so much more to beaing a human being that meets the eye and that the physical form we currently have is almost designed to distract us and cconvince that that's all there is.
<br>
Even if I never achieve a conscious OBE I'm still happpy that I chose (or was led) to a path oh spiritual development and constructive introspection.

Yep, you got it in one. There is MUCH more to being Physical than meets the eye. But thinking about that in a sense of well, it may be true it may be not; and then getting full-blown hits from repeated true-Astral experiences is *totally* mind boggling.

Here's a weird thing totally unrelated to the topic but since it's my topic
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_wink.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>

<br>
<br>
I come from a very religiously orthodox family background ('ve listened to any amount of preaching and fire and brimstone hee hee).
<br>
I'm begining to understand the people who claim to be reborn. The experiences I've had over the time I've tread my path have at times totally blown my mind (and I haven't had the conscious OBE yet!). I think what these people talk about may well be a glimpse of the astral distorted by the heavy religious context in which the are immersed.
<br>
Now I'm not downplaying their experience in any way. It's just that all the religions may well turn out to be based on a sudden insight into the truth behind our existence and a lack of a meaningful way of sharing it with the society around at the time.
<br>
The fact that anyone willing to be open minded can share these experiences and see behind the scenes is a treasure that everyone should share. But as the experience and especially the willingness to embrace the change in (overworked word but..) paradigm of our existence is subjective to the extreme I don't see any way to share it with anyone who isn't on the path already. Religions try to do exactly this and while the cause may be just the means are flawed as is proven by the millions of people for whom religion is merely go-to-church-every-sunday-and-then-forget-it.
<br>
But I'm climbing on a soap box here so I'll stop.
<br>
Can you tell why I absolutely refused my family's wish for me to become a priest? I'd be the heretic and the devout at the same time and that doesn't sit well with either camp, does it?

Hi Jouni,
<br>
<br>
I always thought that any kind of event (noise, spasm, etc) that grabbed your attention during trance was one of two things:
<br>
<br>
Your fear manifesting to keep you from progressing, or,
<br>
<br>
An event provided by your subconscious to put you where you 'need' to be to reach your goals.  If it results in fear, then maybe your subconscious is directing you to address your fears.
<br>
<br>
I haven't had the scary noise bit, except for a =BOOM= once, which sounded like an atomic explosion and scared the **** out of me. But I think that might have been a re-entry noise, not an exit noise. I do have spasmodic jerks during trance, and I wonder if it is a reaction to keep me in the right zone --- like if I start to fall asleep my subconscious realizes and jerks a muscle to wake me up.
<br>
<br>
This one,  &lt; 2c.
<br>
<br>
Patty

Kinda expected that you'd reply to this threa. Don't know why though

<br>
<br>
You summarized the bit about the  noise nicely. Definitely &gt;2c hee hee That's exactly how I see it.
<br>
The sounds that freak me out aren't the big booms and the world collapsing aroud me. It's the little snaps and squeaks. They bug the #¤%&amp; out of me for some reason.
<br>
<br>
Did you read "De Arte Cacophonica"? If I've ever heard a spirited (no pun intended) attempt at distraction that was it!
<br>
<br>
I definitely feel that the noises are a learning tool and some sort of preparation for the expected behaviour after an actual AP takes place.

Hi
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I didn't have much to add, but I appreciate your feedback to
<i>
 my
</i>
posts, so I thought I would at least make the effort.  I
<i>
 do
</i>
hear all sorts of cracks and pops when I trance at night. I think it is the house 'settling' and I only notice it when I am looking for stillness. Usually I stop noticing it after a while. That's close to when I fall asleep lately.

Hee Thanks. I appreciate the effort

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; Good to hear the input was useful.
<br>
Yep, I prettymuch know it only the building settling and cooling but it seems I I can't shake the tendency to read into the sounds..
<br>
So I've come to the view that they are a deliberate hurdle place in our way by our higher self (or subconscious?) to master in order to proceed to something more important and meaningful.

I saw your thread a couple days ago and just getting around to saying something, since i have been intersested in noises too. On the first art bell interview RB said something that there are manifestations designed to keep us in our bodies, unfortunately he did not go into it any further.
<br>
A couple of times i have heard my kids voices in the next room so it is not just scary stuff.
<br>
Once i was in an altered space and heard the air filter in the bedroom sound weird, i asked a psychic friend and she said i was hearing in through one of my lower chakras, so i think as we go into altered states our perceptions change.

hi jouni,
<br>
i'm not sure whether the noises are an obstacle, or are meant as an obstacle. Like you, I've yet to visit this astral plane everyone is talking about ! But it is my belief that the noises are merely a "side effect" of the state of conciousness of the individual, possibly created in the individual's own mind,  or possibly sounds that have "leaked through" from the astral planes.
<br>
<br>
Having said that...if we accept projection is something that anybody can acheive, something that the body is equipped with, then it could be viewed as an obstacle. E.g If you exercise your muscles too much, lactic acid builds up and acts as an obstacle to further exercise, preventing you going too far and damaging yourself.......Then your muscles become stronger and are capable of more in your future efforts. Perhaps the mind works in the same sort of way !
