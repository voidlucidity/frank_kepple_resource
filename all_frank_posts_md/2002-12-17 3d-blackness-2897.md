Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
I have concluded that accessing this "3D blackness" is an extremely imporyant aspect of phasing - it seems to be the very borderline from where the Astral is accessed by any one of a number of methods, including tunnels.
<br>
<br>
I particularly note the recent comment by Ginny (who I hope will read this):
<br>
<br>
<b>
 <i>

 </i>
</b>
<br>
<br>
I wonder if Ginny or anyone could expand on this "placing of intent into 3D blackness", and what preparations are required.
<br>
<br>
BTW Ginny - thanks for some truly excellent accounts of your experiences!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,

Hi Adrian,
<br>
<br>
I've copied the paragraph regarding how to place intent from the post,  "Focusing Attention Within and My F27 Place' (I think that's the title---see below). Once I do the relaxation breathing, gathering energy, bringing to me the feel of love...then I use the Placing Intent Technique below....to go to the 3D blackness, or ask for a Helper to accompany me to a retrieval, to visit F27...etc. At Bruce's last chat he introduced something new: how to use the 3D blackness to get anywhere in the afterlife, instantaneously---and Adrian, it's a gas!---LOL! Wow!
<br>
When I place the intent to go to the 3D blackness...at some point you'll go from seeing  a flat black behind your closed eye lids to a blackness that seems to have depth, full of life, a soft texture perhaps, a feeling of endlessness. This is what I experience when There. What Bruce said to do (and we're waiting for the chat transcript to arrive via email whereby I can post it here---Bruce explains this so well) is once there, decide where you'd like to go in the afterlife and then just relax, observe the 3D aspects of this blackness...and just watch for any areas that don't seem to blend in with the 3D fabric, so to speak. For instance, you may observe/feel a small area that seems to sparkle, or appear dull and flat in color or appearance, or wiggle. These deviations are subtle (to me they are, they may be more pronounced to others). The last one I used was a small area ahead and to the left---it appeared to be a flat dark area in relief. Since I had already decided I wanted to go to my new F27 place, I focused on that oddity or flat black area and bingo!---I was in my treehouse. Also, I find that when I pay attention to areas that also feel different, this serves to locate them also. These areas of deviation in the 3D blackness are portals, openings whereby we can just zip off and be where we want to be. In experimenting with this I've discovered that it's great practice for using nonphysical senses: sensing, feeling, receiving thoughts etc---opposed to always needing to 'see' or 'hear'.
<br>
<br>
Okay...here's the Intent post:
<br>
<br>
In using the TMI Gateway tapes over 13 years ago, if I had known then what I know now about the placing of intent, I never would have spent so many hours hanging out in that inner 3D blackness--while using a tape---waiting for something to happen. I would get to a focus level and then just wait for someone or something to happen, having no idea that all I had to do was mentally state my desire---where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do. Now I know that placing intent is a simple thing to do. Actually we do it constantly and really never give it much thought.
<br>
What Bruce calls, The Little Finger Exercise: this is where I am now going to FEEL that place within where we actually place the intent for anything. I use this everytime I want to place the intent to explore because it works. As I remain relaxed, knowing I'm going to move, say, my index finger in a few seconds, as I approach that moment of actually moving my finger I first just feel and become acquainted with that area within where we make things happen. Some people 'see' color or perhaps an image, some just feel that inner place. At Bruce's workshop I 'saw' a soft orange color (why I don't know)...but most importantly, I became acquainted with what that area of consciousness *felt like*. And when you're there, move your finger. And then do it again but instead of moving your finger, place your intent (desire) on where you want to go in the afterlife, who you want to meet, etc. I must say here that I don't feel I'm explaining this step well....but I hope you guys can get the drift. There are times in the afterlife when I just relax and send out a mental statement.....place my intent.
<br>
<br>
Have fun with this. It's only been around 10 days since we heard about this new travel method so I'm learning as I go...but as is true with everything in the afterlife, all of it is ours...available to all, at any time. And Adrian, Bruce has posted several messages at his conversation board regarding this, so you may want to pay a visit and read as I'm sure I've only given a rough idea here.
<br>
<br>
Much love...and I enjoy very much being a part of this forum. Thank you again.

Thanks once again for an

<br>
Clearly the placing of intent is very important in the phasing process. But before that, as a pre-requisite, it is necessary to achieve the pre-intent state. You mention relaxation and energy raising - I was just wondering just how relaxed, and how much energy you raise and how before the intent procedure?
<br>
<br>
Many OBE in general techniques require, for example, a complete vacancy of mind in order to filter out all of the external "noise" and mundane thoughts. This is of course meditation in effect.
<br>
<br>
How long does it take you to get from the start of the phasing session to 3D blackness?
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much indeed again for your valuable contributions. These are all very central and pivotal issues for anyone wishing success at phasing.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,

I would say that being in the 3D blackness means that you are in a very relaxed state, but to be in a very relaxed state does not mean that you're in the 3D blackness.
<br>
<br>
A lot of people have trouble imaging what this 3D blackness is like, so I will try to give you a visual example.  Imagine that you walk into your bedroom, and everything is pitch black.  I'm talking NO source of light anywhere.  THe blackness you will see would be very two dimensional and flat.  You may see flashes of light or sparkles, but for the most part, there is no substance to this blackness.
<br>
<br>
Now, imagine that there is a slight (and I do mean slight) illumination coming from another room, which seeps into your bedroom from the bottom of your closed bedroom door.  It will still be very dark in your room, but now you can make out shapes.  Just ahead of you, you may be able to see the outline of your dresser.  You might sense your nightstand on your left.
<br>
<br>
It's that kind of FEELING that I get when I'm in the 3D blackness.  There is a depth that comes with it which allows me to 'move' around it and focus on different things.
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.....

Adrian, one of the main relaxation techniques that I do now is something that I read from Bruce's site, and it works every time with me.
<br>
<br>
It's the 3x3x3 technique, and there's nothing magical about it.  In fact, it sounds a lot like things we've heard before, but by labelling it '3x3x3', it seems a bit more practical.
<br>
<br>
Here's is what I do.  When laying down in a relaxed position and eyes closed, I take a very deep breath in.  I hold it for a second, and then exhale.  Nothing special, just simple deep breaths.  On the exhale, make sure you relax your entire body.
<br>
<br>
Do that 3 times.
<br>
<br>
After that, when you inhale, imagine that you're drawing up bright, sparkling energy from a pool just below your feet.  Draw this energy up through your body on the inhale.  Hold it for a second, and then when you exhale, imagine that energy to come out of the top of your head, and shimmer back down into the pool by your feet.
<br>
<br>
Do that 3 times.
<br>
<br>
Finally, you do the opposite.  Take a deep breath in, but this time, imagine that you're drawing energy from a pool located ABOVE your head.  Draw this energy into your body.......and on the exhale, push that energy out your feet and into the pool of energy located down there.
<br>
<br>
Do that 3 times.
<br>
<br>
That's it.  You might be surprised at how RELAXED you are from simply taking 9 breaths with the preceding exercise.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, as was the case with me last night, after doing this exercise, I still wasn't relaxed.  At that point, I continued to take deep, relaxing breaths, but on the exhale, I 'imagined' that I sunk deeper and deeper into the blackness of my closed eyelids.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I recommend everyone to try that technique.  One of the things I notice is that after doing those 9 breaths, when I'm done, it almost feels like I'm breathing only a couple times a minute.......like I can hold my breath forever, simply because I'm so relaxed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Hi Adrain,
<br>
<br>
Jeff gave a good description of what Bruce teaches (I posted how I use the techniques in this forum's post, Focusing Attention Within and My F27 Place)....and the only thing I want to add is the importance of FEELING each simple exercise or stage.
<br>
For instance, with the relaxation method....in a sitting position or stretched out--whatever works for you--as you begin to take in slow, deep  inhales cycling into slow deep exhales...you can do this 3 times or as many times as you want..but the important thing is to be aware of when you FEEL yourself shift into a more relaxed state. It's this *feeling* that is the key to you being ready to move to the next exercise. And with the energy gathering technique, same thing.....draw up through your feet and up out the top of your head (Jeff described this beautifully!) sparkling clean energy from a pool of energy below you and *feel* this, feel/see it go straight up above you as well as cascade around you and back down into the ppol...do as many times as you want...then draw clean sparkling energy from a pool above you (it can help prior to doing this to perhaps feel a spot at the top of your head where you'd like the energy from above to enter) and draw it down into your head, down your body to exit the feet and continue straight down as well as cycle back up around you to reenter the pool above...and once again, just feel this energy runing through you. Feeling is such an important afterlife tool.
<br>
<br>
I'm starting to realize that Phasing (please correct me if I'm wrong) involves a body relaxation that apparently requires a feeling or similar state of semi-paralysis? To others out there able to achieve this often, my hats off to you!  Wow. Adrian, what Bruce discovered and teaches doesn't involve such a deep state of relaxation. He experienced being OOB (as I have and still do on occasion) years ago but could never control or have them at will, as frequently as he wanted to explore the afterlife.

 <br>
 He also discovered most people struggled with attaining and controlling OOBEs, and that reaching super deep relaxation states was difficult as well. He found that by simply relaxing, as I stated earlier, to the point where you *feel yourself shift* or become more relaxed...and by gathering energy from below and above and simply feeling this procedure....all while in a conscious state (sometimes I'm sitting in my office, sometimes lying down)...that this was more than enough to shift one's attention away from the physical into the Non. For me, by the time I've gone through this preparatory process and am ready to journey into  the afterlife, I am in a nice relaxed state. At this point my awareness is bi-located: awareness of my physical surroundings (sitting in a chair, dog barks etc) and aware of being within....but I'd say 95% is within and 5% without. It varies sometimes...maybe I'll be less aware within and more aware of the physical at this point, but it's okay...no need to feel we have to be 'cut off' so to speak from physical awareness. The more I begin to explore within the more my attention just doesn't notice the physical.  If any noises or lights happen while I'm exploring, I usually either don't notice them or ignore...or if my attention is momentarily bumped out of There I just relax and go abck immediately or wait for a better time. It's now becoming apparent that I can be very much There, in the afterlife, while I'm shopping or painting. This is new ( or more accurately, this is something we all do but are just unaware) and am still getting a grip on it!
 <br>
 <br>
 I use to think I too had to rid my mind of that steady stream of thinking, as well as put a stop to any and all external distractions...in order to perceive There...but this isn't necessary. If it's what someone wants to do, great: each to their own. For me such states were not only exotic but terribly difficult to achieve. Our awareness/attention is multi-located all the time anyway...we just for the most part aren't aware of this. Why I like Bruce's methods is because it's for everyone.
 <br>
 <br>
 When I first started using Bruce's relaxation and energy gathering methods I would take my time...perhaps around 10 minutes, maybe more maybe less. Always depends on how keyed-up I am from a stressful day too. At his workshop he goes a bit slower so everyone can take their time, adjust to the technique, feel any changes. But now, hmmm...I'd say for the most part I'm good to go within just a few minutes, at times within a minute. I've learned to connect with the *feel* of each stage (relax, energy gathering, feel of love, placing intent) and from experience have come to trust or know that experiencing the feel of any area or shift is what gets us there.
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian, hope this helps. And as always, I can only describe for the most part what I myself understand and experience. But that's what the afterlife invites us to do.....get our own direct experience.---:O)
 <br>
 <br>
 Much love,
 <br>

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Thank you Jeff and Ginny for expanding further on these matters!
<br>
<br>
I have locked the topic in place, for now at least, as it seems to be an important aspect of successful Astral phasing along with relaxation and intent.
<br>
<br>
Ginny, with regards to your comment:

<br>
<br>
It isn't really a state of paralysis but rather a state that is commonly known as "trance" - which can be described as the "mind awake, body asleep" state.  The trance state allow the dissociation of the mind from the five mundane physical senses, and thereby allowing an expansion of consciousness to the Astral spheres.
<br>
<br>
The method you describe, and as taught by Bruce, seems to me to provide a potentially quicker route to Astral phasing.
<br>
<br>
This does however give rise to another question - with phasing generally, it seems to be necessary to fully dissociate from the physical body, i.e. a full trance state, in order to have a full Astral presence - i.e. where the projector can fully perceive and participate in everything in full holographic 3D, and likewise the Astral residents can full perceive and interact with the projector.
<br>
<br>
How does this method taught by Bruce compare fron an Astral presence point of view?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your valuable input!

With best regards,
<br>

Adrian.

Hi Fredhedd,
<br>
<br>
The 3D blackness is an area of consciousness... and apparently sort of like a central hubb where we can from there travel to wherever we desire in the nonphysical. A few minutes ago I posted Bruce Moen's explanation of it,  how to get to it and use it, as he explains it so well. And no, no need to be in a near-trance or super meditative state to get There.

Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Oooo...good question. Dora and I were talking about what would happen if the two were combined!---:O)
<br>
<br>
All I can do here I guess is give a one-sided answer as I don't Phase into the afterlife into 3D imagery...but let me take a stab here at what I experience and why it's been the method of choice for me.
<br>
<br>
If you lined up all the folks I've helped retrieve in the afterlife, Adrian, as well as Helpers, Guides and say others at F27 I've encountered...I'd be willing to bet I wouldn't be able to identify hardly anyone just by their looks. But...I'd I.D. them instantly from their *feel*...their energy and any history contained therein (a rote),  that passed between us when we met. A few Disk Family members I'd visually recognize, and environments There...yes, but for the most part, their energy-feel is what I'd recognize. This recognition, from learning to sense and feel the energies of others, from learning to receive  and send rotes...has---for me---come about due to exploring the afterlife without '3D seeing' or the full-blown, physical-like, ' 5 senses' abilities. This does not mean that exploring through Phasing can't bring about the same learning---not at all. And perhaps this is what Bob Monroe was eventually doing?
<br>
<br>
I 'see' with the mind's eye, which can be anything from grainy black and white to fixed, in-color imagery  that has all the 3D to it but again, what you'd see in your mind's eye. At times I get flashes of images or near to nothing...but once again I rely on sensing, feelings, thoughts, *knowings*  to understand what's happening There. At times I experience physical-like touching, hearing, smelling....but for the most part I *sense* these things instead of experiencing something almost physical-like. In the beginning of retrieving, Adrian, my attitude was I had to see it to believe it was true....and my Guides eventually pulled the plug on that *belief*---lol!
<br>
<br>
When I'm There...I fully interact with people There, as they do with me. From what I've been able to gather communciation is nonverbal There, or NVC as Monroe coined it, and NVC involves not only a thought transferance but feelings, sensing etc.
<br>
<br>
Have I strayed off the path here or was I able to answer your question? It seems that it isn't necessary to disassociate from the body, as you described,  in order to fully interact There. All I know Adrian is that with Focused Attention, I've learned to navigate and interact with all that NVC implies...and I've only scratched the surface!---:O)
<br>

LOL! For years and years, Frank, I was not a happy camper being in this physical life. Truly felt like a stranger in a strange land. I wanted nothing more than to get answers as to why the *!#* I was here and who could I chew out for such a miserable existence. Discontent drove me to get answers....and I wanted *my own answers*. So, I've got some artistic talent...but when it comes to afterlife exploration talent?....noooooo. I truly do things somewhat backwards and have to unravel it later...having  things 'dawn' on me like a sledgehammer. I just have drive and have always beem super curious about the 'why' of it all (never grew out of the terrible 2's stage)....and since so much of physical life in this day and age is boring to me, seeking new horizons to off-set boredom and tediousness also has a big attraction for me.
<br>
<br>
So see? Your nice compliment netted you a long paragraph full of hot air!-----:O)

Much love my friend,

Hi Ginny,
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much indeed for expanding on the Astral presence side of things as you experience them!
<br>
<br>
First of all let me stress that it is the individual "experience" and what one gets out of it - in you case a great deal - that really matters. In many ways, the ability to feel and interpret energy is a very real and useful ability,and probably results in less distortion than relying purely on physical like senses.
<br>
<br>
The reason I asked is because conventional Astral projection, and Monroe type "phasing" is - and I am sure Frank will confirm this  - a full 3D, full colour, holgographic experience,  and which seems more real (because it
<b>
 is
</b>
more real) than the physical world which seems dull and illusiory by comparison - because of course the physical world  actually really is dull and illusiory

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
There seems little doubt, and I have had this conversation with Bruce, that the greater the state of trance, and depth of phasing procedure, the more solid and real the Astral will be - due to a greater expansion of consciousness and dissociation from the five mundane physical senses. I think this is what Bob Monroe discovered when he moved from conventional OBE to developing phasing in conjunction with hemi-sync.
<br>
<br>
However - I believe it is
<b>
 extremely important
</b>
that people discover and recognise Spiritual Truths regarding the important vital opportunities presented in the physical life, and how to maximise them for passing on the the higher/inner spheres. We are all here to learn valuable lessons, to progress,and which is orders of magnitude more difficult after passing on,and until the next incarnation. The very reason that the physical world is in the state it is in is because people are oblivious to these realities, and go about living their lives for material gain, greed, avarice and all of the other ugly traits we currently see from incarnated mankind, most of whom live as if this is there only life, and they have to make the most of it at any cost. Many people also, due to the lack of knowledge of these realities, live their lives in fear, and as Yoda so eloquently stated " fear leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering" - how true that is with sadly so many examples we see each day.
<br>
<br>
This is why afterlife exploration is so important, and
<b>
 should
</b>
be within the reach of everyone. It it were, and there were more people around like the people here, then the world would be an infinitely better place, and people would not waste their physical existences on meaningless selfish things.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

It's interesting that Bruce Moen advises moving your eyes around during the exercise to find the 3D Blackness. Judging from Jeff Mash's description of it, I think I have experienced the 3D Blackness recently during times in the morning when I would wake up and try getting back to sleep. I would notice that the blackness (or, in my case, grayness due to it being light out) had the same quality that Jeff describes. The only difference is, when I thought to myself "I'm in the 3D Blackness" I would shift out of it and I think my eyes would move during the shift. I am not sure if the shift caused my eyes to refocus, or my eyes may have moved and that triggered the shift.
<br>
I did notice that, when I was at TMI, during the first 2 days when I actually had experiences, I was getting a lot of hypnagogic imagery, but it would go away as soon as I would try and focus with my physical eyes.
<br>
So, is the 3D Blackness just the backdrop to hypnagogic imagery (maybe the hypnagogic state with no images yet?), or is it a different feeling of consciousness?

*******Hi Adrian,
<br>
<br>
~There seems little doubt, and I have had this conversation with Bruce, that the greater the state of trance, and depth of phasing procedure, the more solid and real the Astral will be - due to a greater expansion of consciousness and dissociation from the five mundane physical senses. I think this is what Bob Monroe discovered when he moved from conventional OBE to developing phasing in conjunction with hemi-sync.~
<br>
<br>
************I honestly don't know. When you say the greater the trance and depth of phasing procedure...the more *solid and real* the Astral will be.....this could very well be the case. Cool. But one thing comes to mind here...and that is,  does it really matter whether we experience this more-than-physical-solidness, opposed to using the mind's eye and NVC...if Phasing and Focused Attention end up netting the same results for all of us?---such as retrieving stuck folks, connecting with our I/There's to discover who and what we really are, etc?
<br>
In the beginning of experimenting with Focused Attention, as I would visit my small park in F27, I was still thinking in the back of my mind that all of this was fantsy---my little mind trip. Since I was 'seeing' with the mind's eye and perceiving in NVC ways I just naturally had doubts. When my deceased mother showed up unexpectedly and an emotional reunion ensued (especially for me), I still had doubts. When she then asked me to follow her somewhere beyond my park I froze. My mind was racing...cause this was not a part of my little self-produced movie. But I asked myself what could I lose in just playing along? So I followed and ended up (I later realized she took me to F23) with her father, my grandfather. He was sitting in a very real looking mock-up of his beach home he loved...and he was stuck. Feelings of guilt, remorse. With the much needed assistance of my Mom he was retrieved...but not before he said some things about his beliefs, beliefs he had held while in the physical I had never known. Right there, on his isolated beach in F23, I went dumbstruck. He was telling me things I had not known about him...all of which I was later able to verify with still living relatives. Sorry to be so long-winded, Adrian...lol...but I guess my point is, I got a solid Knowing that the afterlife was indeed real, because of information gathered from a deceased person I was able to later verify (and have experienced a great many more validations since)...and if Phasing brings on that Knowing because your interaction with the afterlife is more real than the physical.....this is wonderful! So, let's all help folks who're stuck There...explore the many many places in the afterlife...and celebrate our eternity together!-----:O)*********

***************Couldn't agree with you more, Adrian. One very important reason, for me, why I was drawn to what Bruce teaches is because he feels the most important thing he teaches is about love....that it is an energy/awareness/consciousness that we come from, are made of...that we can fill with simply by *feeling* a time when we loved or felt loved...and allowing that feeling of love to grow within. I not only do this prior to exploring and retrieving but use it in my daily life...and it has changed me. Animals recognize this energy/radiation with little problem. So, one person at a time...becoming aware of their own eternity and the love that they are...perhaps this is what Monroe, Moen and other explorers have discovered is happening here with the earth after all?********

Greetings Ginny,
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your further valued insight!
<br>
<br>
I totally and completely agree with you that the experiences by any phasing method are very real, and most valuable in veryifying the Astral, i.e. afterlife truths and realities ,as you yourself have demonstrated time and again. There is also no doubt that the methods taught by Bruce are extremely valuable in this regard, as it brings these realities into the scopy of very many more people than would otherwise be the case, and with the benefits upon which we all agree. Indeed, if Bruce's methods were much more widely taught and available, I have no doubt that it could potentially have a very profound impact on the direction of mankind  - specifically in the right direction. It would also help to make people think very hard about all of the creed and dogma that has been leading so many people astray, and away from these higher/inner truths and realities for nearly 2000 years now.
<br>
<br>
I don't think there is any doubt that the greater one can dissociate from the physical world, the more one associates with the Astral, and which manifests itself in the highest level of experience as the full 3D holographic, larger than life presence. Whether that level of presence is required is really a matter for the aspirations of each individual. For verification of the afterlife, and for guided soul retrievals and many more things, Bruce's methods are excellent. But then again, for other Astral "work" the higher level, Monroe type phasing might be more desirable. Frank sums this up very well indeed with his comparisons of both within the context of the Astral library visits.
<br>
<br>
What I was really trying to get to was to suggest that once the method of afterlife exploration as taught by Bruce has been accomplished to such a fine level of skill as yourself, it might, depending on further aspirations, be worth extending and deepening the experience to the full Astral presence by attaining a deeper state of trance and relaxation first.
<br>
<br>
But I do think this is extremely important. Bruce, yourself and many others have now demonstrated that almost anyone can participate in Astral, afterlife exploration, and that alone is an extremely good basis upon which to build.
<br>
<br>
I believe the work you are doing is exceptional, and I look forward to hearing of your latest afterlife encounters.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for a much valued contribution!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

see this is what amazes me....I have found that nine times out of ten when I am practicing OBE in bed, I get to this point within about ten minutes.  All of these things that seem to be pre requisites, I can get to within 20 minutes.  There must be an internal hinderence within me that is holding me back.  Though life is becoming more clear to me now, due to some personal things happening in my life.  Maybe I just need to come to grips with myself?

Another aspect of this that comes to mind for me is, as others have mentioned elsewhere, is that of intent. How vivid and real the experience of the astral is, is also dependant upon why you are going there and who you interract with.
<br>
<br>
For example, I have been doing what I now realize from reading on this forum is a form of focused attention and phasing. I had been refering to them as meditation and channeling. (though I do dislike the word channeling because it conjurs up images of being taken over by a discarnate entity which is not what I am talking about. However, I learned to do what I am doing from a person who considered herself a "channeler". Now I see that they are essentially the same thing). What I do is sit at a computer and relax, go as deep as I can, though it is not at all necessary to be in trance and then I project, even sometimes state, my intention of what I want to do. In my case, that has frequently been to contact certain people, either someone I knew or someone a friend might have asked me to contact. What I find is that certain personalities are so dynamic and insistent in their intent to come through, combined with my intent to make the connection, that the encounter then is that much more real, and the 3D reality quality of it increases. Another example is that I am frequently taken to/shown/go to scenes and settings that are not in this current time period but are from other historical eras. I usually then experience a series of events, like living out a drama and then the meaning of them is either stated for me somewhere, or afterwards I read over later I see the meaning (I type up what I am experiencing while I experience it). A lot of this has reincarnational or simultaneous lives information about it, though not always. I haven't yet tried to determine where I go, I just get swept along to certain places. I think they must be in response to my general, non-stated intent to know more about who I really am in the larger reality sense.
<br>
<br>
One side benefit of this is that I record what I am seeing and experiencing as I go. Though this limits me in certain ways, it also means that I often jot down things that seem meaningless to me, gibberish, disconnected images, and then only later when I re-read it, do I see that it has a deeper meaning I didn't notice the first time. This can take the form of actual words and messages said to me or in an accumulation of images that afterwards amount to a fuller description of the setting and location. It is hard to describe exactly what I mean about this.
<br>
<br>
I think now, though, I am going to try to also do this without typing down what is happening and see where that goes. It is odd, but for some reason, until I read this forum, I was separating the two and doing "channeling" and then doing meditation, either using Monroe's Gateway Series tapes or without them.
<br>
<br>
One of the drawbacks to this focused attention or channeling approach is that if the astral experience is not real vivid, it can make unsure what is coming from your own mind and what is actually coming from the astral.
<br>
<br>
It has been invaluable reading these posts. Thanks.
<br>
Pete
