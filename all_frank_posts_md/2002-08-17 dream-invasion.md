<section>
My roommate was having nightmares making "unhappy" noises in her sleep. It woke me up.
<br>
I walked into her dream and saw her arguing with a dark haired girl. I said
<br>
"Stop! You're having a nightmare!" and waved my hand, erasing it and turning the whole scene white.
<br>
Immediatly I woke up. I decided I would freak my roomate out by telling her what she dreamed. So I went to wake her up.
<br>
"Do you remember what you dreamed?" I asked
<br>
"Oh my God! You! You walked into my dream! And you stopped it!"
<br>
I was so shocked that she remembered everything.
<br>
I have never heard of anything like that before and am not sure how I did it in the first place. I didn't even know it was possible.

My brother and I had the same dream once but neither of us realized we were dreaming at the time. It only happened once though. Are you and your roommate close?

Yes, it is possible. All you did was meet on the base level Astral somewhere. That's where people do their dreaming. I've come across my wife's Spirit a number of times, but haven't yet been able to wake her up. I found she likes to sleep outdoors, curled up amongst nature.

<section>
Yes, my roommate and I are close. I think she's gotten used to the strange goings on around our house. At first I was afraid she'd get scared and move out.
<br>
She's been witness to more than a few oddities.
<br>
One time I did a summonsing, and the spirit actually showed up  (scared the crap out of me.)
<br>
I didn't tell her, but she came to me the next day and described it in perfect detail "I saw this weird thing as I was falling asleep..." She thought it was a side effect of her sleeping pills! Haha.
<br>
I later confessed.
<br>
A brave soul, she's taking it all in stride. She's even started to study it herself.

i gotta learn how to do that, when ever me and my friends are camping, one of them keeps making wierd mumbling sounds, his eyes sometimes move, he makes wierd slobering sounds, and he twitches. I wanna show up in that dream hes having at the time and scare him.
<br>
<br>
Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.

 HI FRANK

,
<br>
It's very apparent that you're an advanced Astral Traveller
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_cool.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_cool.gif" border=0&gt;.  How would a person go about finding a loved one or friend, as they are dreaming on the Astral?  This absolutely fascinates me.  I've already a friend willing to allow me to "visit" him in his dreams ... I just haven't figured out how ... yet!  Thanks!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Navigating to specific places is what I am working on. Problem is, even though I've been projecting within the Astral-proper for around 15 years, I only ever thought of it as some huge adventure playground that I go to, and come back from. Call me dumb, but in all that time I never actually realised that you can navigate between different regions whilst you were there.
<br>
<br>
As a result, I can get to the Astral and back no problem. But my navigation skills are a bit iffy to say the least. I found that when trying to navigate "intent" plays a big role. What you do is become still and focus your thoughts upon that person with the intention of going to them. If it works, you find yourself in their vicinity. Another way is to ask for a guide to take you to them.

The RTZ is a kind of buffer zone that sits between the Physical and the start of the base-level Astral.

<section>
FRANK,
<br>
Thanks for your input on INTENT ... I'll be working on that, as my intent seems to be flippant at times.  My INTENT thus far has been to GET OUT
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_big.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_big.gif" border=0&gt;... I'll set specific intent for what to DO when I'm out.  I'm going to start a list titled "101 things to do when OBE" ... this should help to ingrain some specifics into my sub-consious!
<br>
<br>
All of my INTENDED OBE's have occured from SLEEP, and because of this, I don't have the AWARENESS of waking hours.  MY OBE and Lucid Dream awareness is very similar
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_sleepy.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_sleepy.gif" border=0&gt; ... and not what I want it to be.  I'm sure that once I improve the awareness aspect, I'll be able to make greater strides on the Astral (and in dreams).
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

<section>
Okay, just read your post.  I will tell you specifically.
<br>
<br>
1) I was asleep
<br>
2) I became aware of her making unhappy noises
<br>
3) My soul woke up (not my body) an OBE
<br>
4) I walked into her dream
<br>
5) I waved my hand and turned the scene white
<br>
6) I entered back into my body
<br>
7) My body woke up, fully aware of what had transpired.
<br>
<br>
I do a lot of "night flying." My soul separates from my body when I sleep. I have some control over where I go and what I do when this happens, but I have not yet been able  to control _when_ it happens.
<br>
I believe control will develop over time. For now I take it as it comes.

<section>
Hi Leyla,
<br>
Thanks for responding to my post ... the "soul waking up" part makes more sense now.  When I get the chance, I'll do what you did (I've been wanting to visit a friend in his dreams).
<br>
<br>
Night flying sounds like fun!  I haven't done that yet ... I do a lot of flying in my dreams, though!  Keep working on gaining that control ... the "when" part would be great!
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
