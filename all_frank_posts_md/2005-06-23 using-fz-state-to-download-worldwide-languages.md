When in the Fz state, can one use affirmations to download a language of choice into your physical brain and wake up able to speak that tounge or at least make that language easier to learn?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You need to step "back" a touch from the Fz state and enter the realms of your imagination. Then create the construct within your imagination and imagine living that reality within the physical. You will be able to create a completely lifelike construct (with a little practice). Then imagine that construct bleeding through into your physical life at the appropriate times. Do it right and it will come about, in stages.
<br>
<br>
There is a very strong side-effect to this you have to be aware of. You will need to be prepared for a LOT of quite severe deja-vu feelings as the bleed-through is taking place. But as you will know it is you, and you will be understanding of the process, it will make you chuckle rather than make you feel weird or freaky. But still, you need to be prepared for it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
