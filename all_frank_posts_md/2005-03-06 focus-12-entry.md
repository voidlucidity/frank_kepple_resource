Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I am not new to this board but new to all of you out there, been reading this board for the past year all your posts about Focus 10-21 I wrote to Major Tom about what it is I do to achieve Focus 12 and how I knew for sure it was Focus 12 instead of deep focus 10.
<br>
<br>
When I first received Wave I of the Hemi-Synch I thought it was just fascinating and by the way it still is after 3 years! I never purchased the other waves, which I will in the very near future. I have been using the first CD on and off for years. I listened as Mr. Monroe as he would guide me through different focus levels. Through all that listening I began to realize many missing parts.
<br>
<br>
He would tell you exactly how to respond to each command given but the mind works at least for myself differently on the interpretation on what's being said at the moment. The sound does help you reach the focus but the mind is ever evolving and creative in all aspects. So by my own instincts I decided to put on a live stage play!
<br>
<br>
As Mr. Monroe would guide me to each focus level I would mentally set-up props as I was guided by Monroes voice, by the end of the first CD I could instantly return to the stage setup and go through it with ease, kind of like a virtual reality adventure story.
<br>
<br>
That's all I will say about that. To get on with the practicals here are the creative steps I developed for my creative side of the mind while following Mr. Monroes guidance to the different levels.
<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope I do not miss alot of steps this is coming from my recall only you can email me for any specifics it will probably be easier for me to recall every minute step.
<br>
<br>
On the first part of the CD you hear the ocean and surf in that waiting period I prep my stage by imagining I am climbing up a latter to a high platform waiting above me I keep this climbing going until Mr. Monroe tells us to put all our cares into the big heavy box.
<br>
<br>
When this happens I reach the top of the platform and my butler stands by the empty box I zipped down my flesh like it were a rubber suite and give it to my butler who proceeds to fold it and places it in the box, while imaging this of course the tones without the voice guidance continues. You see my friends when you keep your conscious mind busy while the tones or guidance's is given until the next step it confuses the conscious thinking thus the tones are more easily sent to your subconscious mind, as you are aware the conscious mind is in capable of doing concentrating on two things at the same time.
<br>
<br>
Now Mr. Monroes voice appears once more and states you are now entering focus 3. At this time the butler opens the door that exits from the platform and the daylight hits my eyes I look down to see a white stone a flat stepping stone with the number 3 on it. When Mr. Monroe tells you to relax in I believe its the 4Th focus level I sit down on my sun chair and just bask in the warm sunlight. If I look back to where I came from (Focus I) I can see the building with the wording Focus I above the door.
<br>
<br>
Then Mr. Monroe will have you doing the (Ohm) for several minutes as he is prepping you to do so, I imagine at the same time I entering into a pyramid through a torch lit corridor until I arrive in the pyramid center itself. I then walk up a stair case to sit on a large cushion and begin to meditate while the chanting of the monks begin.
<br>
<br>
When the chanting is just about over, I immediately stand up and begin to walk down the stair case to another exit leading outside the pyramid again entering a sunny day, here I believe Mr. Monroe directs us to say some affirmations, but what I do instead I imagine two individuals with robes on handing me a scroll as Mr. Monroe begins to tell us what to affirm I imagine opening the scroll slowly and reading only on what's being said.
<br>
<br>
The next step as I follow the pathway those flat white stones I talked about earlier, leading out from this building of affirmation, Mr. Monroe then leads us to other focus levels to get us to focus 10. So each focus from the affirmation building is made by making a single step on each stone till you come to the next to the last stone that shows a #9. Once I get to the #9 stone I then look up and imagine a small hill and up on the hill is a grass hut structure and above the huts door is the word, "focus 10".
<br>
<br>
I have finally arrived at last to reach focus 10. As Mr. Monroe is guiding you to final prop you have created you will enter into the hut upon him stating you have now enter into focus 10, now relax he states and enjoy focus 10. When I entered my hut I relaxed and looked down from the hill and saw the affirmation building then the pyramid and the place where I basked in the sun and the building from which I came from focus 1. What I was doing was re-affirming every where I have been prior to getting up to where I was currently at, convincing my subconscious the trip was real while the tones kept me in that particular state of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I began to look around in the hut and imagine what I would see if I were in a real one, except , now here is where it got interesting, I saw a window but instead of it showing the outside as a bright and sunny day it was black that 3D blackness everyone talks about. I found it fascinating so out of curiosity I starred at intently. Now you have to know this I did not create this black void it was just there on its own. That's why it surprise the heck out of me. Throughout the journey I created the other props to keep my conscious mind occupied, but had no idea what was to be expected once I was in the hut of focus 10.
<br>
<br>
To continue I began to see those swirling colors of light a few of you talk about, you must know at the time of this discovery I did not know what focus 12 was or what I was suppose to see, I just let my mind do whatever it wanted to from this point on, not preconceiving anything at this particular moment.
<br>
<br>
But then I had this incredible urge to jump out the window into that blackness and when I did, yikes!!!! My head felt like it expanded in all directions the scary part I had no control over this whatsoever! My subconscious was completely taken over the story script. It shocked me so bad I ended up back into the hut or at focus 10 level. I knew though had I maintained I would have crossed over a bridge of some sort. This technique I created was only less than a year ago.
<br>
<br>
But due to my moving into my new house and getting a new job my life has been quite hectic. But now I am settled in and ready to continue my journey to focus 12 entry way from the hut. But I question when I was in that state after jumping into the window I felt a higher level was proceeding way beyond 12 if you get this far you will understand what it is I am trying to convey here.
<br>
<br>
Sorry this is so long, I just hope it helps someone at least.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
That was probably the most interesting and comprehensive first post anyone has ever put to this forum. I couldn't resist chuckling to myself when you were talking about the 3D blackness and saying how you realised that it was not you who was creating it. Because that is how it tends to happen. Once moment you are comfortably wallowing in your own mental imagery and then suddenly it's like, hang on, I'm not creating this!
<br>
<br>
Hopefully your external life will now settle down to the point where you can take up your internal studies again, and build upon the successes you have offered yourself.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

Hi everyone around,
<br>
<br>
I must confess I'm overwhelmed with so much information. I mean, I do a search in this web and thousands of matches come to my screen. I start reading with great interest and I find out there're more phasing-techniques... while John Miles is singing "Music was my first love" in my earphones
<img alt=";-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
<br>
<br>
Anyway I wanted to share some information, although I'm quite a novel practitioner in this field. And, in fact, one of the big troubles practicing these techniques is tiredness. I mean, I come back home after 8h of office work, switch on my ipod in order to listen to Mr Monroe's voice and I finally get asleep without sense of it. But, happily I told myself: "dude! sacrifice something!" And I've just done it, to reduce my lunch time to practice phasing (curiously my digestion processes have improved quite a lot since that).
<br>
<br>
Time ago I found out a book on yoga which was quite out of catalogue, and thanks God it came to my hands. In it there were described some basic terms on yoga, you know, pratyahara, sadhana, samadhi and the like. The yogi himself gave much importance to relaxation and, in fact, that aspect was pointed out several times. I didn't understand in that moment the real implications of something like that. Even more, the yogi told about uniting with God (which it is what yoga means) with such exercises.
<br>
<br>
I suspect that some Focus X will be related with samadhi or complete communion with God.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, what Correction has posted would be quite difficult to be achieved by me, just because such imagery would need such a mental effort that I would be more tense trying to form the stage than relaxing.
<br>
<br>
It is important for me to comment the following point. That heavy conversion box thing surprised me a lot the first time I faced it. The act of remembering what stuff bothers me makes the stuff itself pop up in my mind really bothering me. And on the other hand it seems we must remove some parts of our psyches to achieve some enlightment.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is. When I thought of taking my annoying thoughts into an obscure box something revolved inside my self, just because I think all those things in my mind conform my own personal universe and all of them take part in some way or other. So I felt it was unfair to get rid of something just because it doesn't fit in my objectives.
<br>
<br>
Ok, boiling down (I tend to extend too much
<img alt=";-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
) I looked for a trick. I assumed that the box itself was also a part of my self, a site where things heal by themselves. Just remember the "Stargate" film, where the aliens used a healing coffin. To say somehow I assumed my box where like that coffin.
<br>
<br>
It worked incredibly well. As I was taking them into the box (just my main worries) I was explaining them what it was going on and, at the same time, I was feeling different body sensations, especially tension relief in my abdomen.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, and pointing that thing about vibrating the chants, I didn't realize anything special till the fourth attempt. In it my forehead started to waver as if it was made of silk and a tender wind was blowing nimbly. A special freshness also invaded it, and this was the first "effect" I noted with the F10 exercise. If you have read something about those Golden Dawn rituals, you'll realise they also use lots of sounds in their worshiping (as Israel Regardie explains very well in his "The tree of life").
<br>
<br>
Curiously, at now, when I start the exercise and the ocean surf sound is listened the wavering feeling comes automatically (I guess that's an advance).
<br>
<br>
To end this post I'd like to ask a little question. What differences are between Monroe's and other systems? And what should I follow? For now, I'm quite comfortable with Monroe's, unless it's true that sometimes I graze the line between dream and awaken state and Monroe's voice shocks me. Ah, by the way, is there any webpage where to read about that other Gateway technique?
<br>
<br>
Ok, that's all. Hope I've not offended anyone due to my comments or questions (I know you are far more experienced than the common of the mortal).
