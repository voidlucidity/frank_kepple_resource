I had a dream that I turned into an OBE the other day. Aside from the usual distortions, I have one that stands out: My experience started in my room, as opposed to the living room in which I was sleeping.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Has this happened to any of you?
</b>
Most of the time I sleep in my room, so maybe my mind projected to the spot I usually start off in.
<br>
<br>
The other problem is that I had a second experience shortly thereafter that was even more distorted. I may just have had a shadow memory mix-up.
<br>
<br>
It's very easy to say "your experience was just a lucid dream." However, my experience was very realistic, and I knew I was OBEing whilst I was having it!
<br>
<br>
Because of the other distortions, I've decided to stop looking for something to remember when I wake up, as my mind always seems to invent stuff that isn't there just for that purpose. Hopefully if I take the "casually observe" approach, I'll remember something when I wake up that I'll then be able to compare.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your input,
<br>

Yes, this experience is very common. People who have not felt that tend to be the ones who typically ask the question, "How do you know your experience was not just a dream?" Simply because, like you say, you are as aware and as conscious as you are while Physical.

This is a big problem when it comes to actively "verifying" your experience while having a full-blown obe. It's all down to the fact that you are within an environment where: as you think, so it becomes. This is where people from the Moen school have a distinct edge. They are taught from the beginning to seek verification of their experiences, but they are doing so from an entirely different standpoint.
<br>
<br>
People try and verify their experiences because they "doubt" whether or not it is "real". This is only natural given the circumstances. But, if you attempt this within the Astral environment, what tends to happen is: all the while you are trying to make some kind of verification, you are inadvertently releasing feelings of doubt. Again, those feelings of doubt are being released directly into an environment where "as you think, so it becomes". As a result, what tends to happen is it has the effect of reinforcing the original doubt.
<br>
<br>
It is possible to become caught in a bit of a downward spiral where the more you try and verify the experience, the more it will appear that someone keeps playing tricks on you. But all that's happening is you are releasing feelings of doubt within the Astral environment.
<br>
<br>
Verification will come to you in good time. You are right in adopting a casual observer approach. This, believe me, is the best way. Just be casual and mildly curious. Later on you will have verifications galore.
<br>
