Good questions Shinobi. I also remember Frank talking about his guides at one point a few years back, but he hasn't mentioned anything lately.
<br>
<br>
You must have been really digging deep into his posts, since those were back around 2002 or so.

<section>
Hi:
<br>
<br>
Some good questions you present, which I take pleasure in replying to, as follows:
<br>
<br>
Things have certainly developed over the years. I've spent a while trying to get my terminology organised and cataloguing my experiences in order to try and present my material in as organised and as congruent a way possible. As you know I take a scientific approach to all of this and part and parcel of it is getting your paperwork in order, so to speak. Laying down your definitions and all that kind of thing. The big problem with this topic is we've had many people all exploring and reporting back after having "done their thing". This is all very well, but at some stage we've got to start pinning things down.
<br>
<br>
Training Ground and Learning Zone these would be Focus 2 of consciousness, yes. But thinking back later on there were other experiences the character of which would suggest to me these were F2/F3 overlay experiences or F3 experiences proper. At the time these experiences were happening I had little idea of the actual structure of the wider reality and how each area is intertwined with another. In a way, I too was still thinking of "the astral" as a kind of separate place that I was travelling to. But it's not something I really thought about all that much. In the early days it was just some huge adventure playground that I used to go to several times a week.
<br>
<br>
The only book I had read at that time was Monroe's Journeys OotB. He mentions about "dead" people in the book. But I could never work out what he was going on about in that respect. Truth is I never thought about it all that much and, as far as I was concerned, I never saw any dead people. Everyone I ever met within this strange kind of reality was very much alive. I just assumed they were people doing the same as me. I had no religious beliefs at all, I thought all the "life after death" stuff was just religious tosh. As far as I was concerned once you're dead that's it, you're dead. Of course, my idea of dead people were stiffs lying in a coffin. It never occurred to me that the people I was interacting with within this reality were actually physically dead. Well, perhaps not all of them because in the early days they would have been aspects of myself in Focus 2. But later on I began interacting with others more and more.
<br>
<br>
Regarding guides, yes, I still communicate with the two I mentioned. But these people are not "higher beings". I now know that Harath is another focus who lives in a different physical system. Freda is not physical at all. Freda's Primary Focus is Focus 3 of consciousness. I interact with these people several times a week. What has happened is the primary thrust of my work on the Astral Pulse has changed to the extent where my priority now is to teach people the Phasing Approach (those that want to, obviously) so we can get projecting and hopefully meet up within Focus 3 of consciousness. Then I'll be able to show people around and whatnot. Whereas before I used to go into the details of my actual experiences a little more. What I want to do now is to actually
<i>
 show
</i>
people, as opposed to me keep trying to explain what I mean. I want to concentrate on getting people projecting for real, then we need to work out ways we can start meeting up.
<br>
<br>
I have introduced the concept of my Virtual Classroom to subscribers of my newsletter and I am hoping this will lead eventually to a core group of around 20 or 30 people who are quite competent at projecting within Focus 3 of consciousness. This is the key to all of this, being able to project within Focus 3 as it is an area of common consensus reality. Once we can start meeting up then I'm sure things are really going to take off for us here at the Astral Pulse.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the "higher beings" concept:
<br>
<br>
I maintain there is no higher or lower in consciousness (beings or otherwise) for reasons due to the structure of the way consciousness is set out. We are each a focus personality that exists as a continuum of consciousness from Focus 4 through to Focus 1.
<br>
<br>
Everyone has the
<i>
 same
</i>
subjective structure. So it's not like some people's continuum of consciousness stops at a certain "level". We all have the same basic structure in consciousness. So no one is any more spiritually "advanced" than any other person, although we do obviously differ in our objective knowing of this and that. But, subjectively, in terms of energy, our structure is the same. If we were to view ourselves as physical beings
<i>
 entirely
</i>
without separation, and I'm very much stressing the word entirely, then we would see that each of us is an individual focus of the very same energy essence that is contained within Focus 4 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
I accept that there are people resident within Focus 4, who are pure energy essences, you might call them, that you can tap into. These people are quite knowledgeable and do come across as kind of "godlike" you could say. But that's only because they are subjective energy essences that exist primarily as a point of consciousness, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
When we each (for want of a better word) "complete" our current movement through consciousness, we too will reside within Focus 4 solely as an energy essence, or a point of consciousness. This is simply part and parcel of adopting Focus 4 as your Primary Focus, instead of Focus 1 or Focus 3. But I guess people in the past have just misunderstood what's what. I can say that if I had come across Focus 4 before Freda and Harath had given me a detailed briefing of what to expect, then even I could well have mistaken my interactions as some kind of communication with divine being(s). :)
<br>
 <br>
  There are also people who reside within areas that are what I call semi-subjective. In the sense they are not entirely the subjective point-of-consciousness, characteristic of people who have adopted Focus 4 as their Primary Focus, but they are not exactly physical either. Sort of half-and-half, you could say. I have met quite a few of these people and they certainly could come across as if they were gods and whatnot. They are not, it's just the way the energy translates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The thought always sticks in mind that perhaps these are the people the early explorers came across. One day I might study more of the old mystical works to try and make sense of them. I mentioned a couple of times on other posts that I flipped through some material on Judaism and I was amazed because in amongst all the religious blurb was talk about what I distinctly saw was a 4-area structure of consciousness very much like I am speaking off. I was kinda gob smacked, in fact. But it's all hidden under layer upon layer of mystical blurb to the extent where no one could make head or tail of it unless you had good knowledge of the structure already.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding energy work:
  <br>
  <br>
  There are obviously specific energy centres. I can set them off more or less at will within Focus 2 and now and again within Focus 1. Sort of when I'm in the mood. I ignite my heart-centre about once a week for the whacky feelings it gives, for example. During a projection experience, I can often sense a light buzzing and kind of static electricity hissing and crackling sensations that I recognise as energy sensations from the various centres. If I project in a conventional sense into the RTZ then I get a specific kind of interaction between my purple and yellow centre that I talked about a few times. But generally, I just let my energy centres simply get on with whatever they need to get on with.
  <br>
  <br>
  To me, the energy centres are like the engine in a car. You don't need to know what's under the bonnet to get in and drive it. Projection is all about driving. That is what I teach people to do, get into their selves and drive off into another reality. Plus, I give them an accurate map they can follow. So they'll always know basically where they are in the general consciousness scheme of things.
  <br>
  <br>
  The energy work approach is a valid approach. It's just that to me it all looks a little esoteric. Some people like it, obviously, and people do gain benefit from it. But the Phasing Approach does not rely on any specific energy work. I will say to anyone having difficulty with energy work to try doing it all within Focus 2 of consciousness. Here you only have to think about moving energy around your body and you feel it instantly. No lying there for months trying with no results in the physical. Anything you can do in the physical you can do within Focus 2 of consciousness. Only the effects are much more direct and more stunning to experience. But I warn you, it can get addictive. :)
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the eyes:
  <br>
  <br>
  I consider the ability to allow the eyes to relax as crucial to success in this. Some people appear to have a knack for it, others, such as myself, have difficulties. My eyes will always try to "snatch a glance" at whatever it is I am perceiving in mind. Not so much now because I got over it. But it took me ages. When my eyes would try to snatch a glance I'd be zapped right out of the state I had worked so darned hard to achieve. It was most frustrating. But, I suppose that's where being a complete, stubborn SOB comes in handy. :)
  <br>
  <br>
  I always maintain that I do not have any particular talent for this. I just keep trying until I work it out somehow. I think a lot of these people who have written books tend to have a natural talent for what they do. I reckon, however, the majority of people are like me, we struggle often with the simplest of things. That's why I have simplified the Phasing approach to as high a degree as possible but still keeping it effective. And always remember that a person can project even into the RTZ (Focus 1 in the Phasing Model) from anywhere within consciousness.
  <br>
  <br>
  People like the idea of projecting within the RTZ because it qualifies as an experience they can believe in. They are seeing familiar surroundings only from a totally different physical perspective. They can spy on their neighbours and stuff. Okay, I'm joking on that last point. But, all in all, it seems far more concrete. None of that wild and whacky "astral stuff". Yeah, I can understand that point of view. But by realising that all of consciousness is intertwined, you can detune your awareness from your current state and even "convert" a lucid dream into an RTZ projection. It's tricky due to the inherent nature of the dream action but it is by no means impossible. I think the problem has been in the past that people simply didn't realise that it
  <i>
   could
  </i>
  be done.
  <br>
  <br>
  You know, after Rodger Bannister ran that sub 4-minute mile, around 20-something people
  <i>
   also
  </i>
  ran a sub 4-minute mile in the twelve-months that followed. Which is pretty amazing statistic since no one had done it in all the years up until then. But that's the difference. You see, Rodger Bannister showed that it
  <i>
   could
  </i>
  be done. Once people realise that it is actually possible, they start to take off with it. Once people realise that it is actually possible to detune one's awareness and convert a lucid dream into any other projection they like, even an RTZ projection, then we are going to see more and more people actually doing it I'm sure. Or at least that is my hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  State of mind is very important:
  <br>
  <br>
  Hardly a minute goes by that I don't think about something or other to do with projection. It has become my life, teaching people about the wider reality and making further discoveries for myself that I can pass on to people. So my own state of mind is not something I really have to think about as it's fully geared towards projection. I was talking about this in a post just recently. Where it does appear that our ability to perceive is proportionate to our ability to believe. So what a person believes is very important. Having the wrong beliefs can scupper your progress quite easily. As the post is relevant I'll paraphrase it, as follows:
  <br>
  <br>
  I first got into this from by chance coming across Monroe's Journeys OotB some 22 years ago. After reading it a couple of times I figured the guy was either insane, or he had come across something important. I had no religious beliefs at all. I thought religion was just a load of bunkum, just an excuse to wage war with each other, and had never come across anything like it before. I hadn't got a "new age bone" in my body, and still don't have. But just happened to see the book and thought the cover looked interesting. On sheer impulse I bought it. Like I say, I thought the Monroe was either insane or he had cottoned onto something important. I wasn't sure which conclusion was the most apt so I gave his technique a try.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much to my surprise I began getting some definite effects and the rest, as they say, is history.
  <br>
  <br>
  So you could say that on the one hand I was not a believer, as such. But on the other hand I was not dismissing it entirely. I was merely curious as to which of my conclusions was the most apt. I had no particular favour for either one. Okay, it was surprising that I received some definite effects. But this was more light-hearted surprise as opposed to a surprise founded on a definite bias to the contrary. Because knowing what I know now, I think that if I had begun from the standpoint of being biased towards Monroe being insane, this would have precluded me from having the experiences that I did. My saying that is pure conjecture, of course. But it does appear the case that a person's ability to perceive is directly proportional to their
  <i>
   willingness
  </i>
  to believe.
  <br>
  <br>
  So if you are simply not willing to believe it, then you close off any channel of communication. Here we get a steady throughput of sceptics who have locked themselves in this kind of mode. No matter what the evidence to the contrary, they are simply not willing to believe it, so none of it they shall experience, simple as that. But you have to be very careful when treading to the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you are willing to believe the "astral" is populated by all manner of "angels" and "gods" and whatever, if that is what you are willing to believe then all manner of angels and gods you shall perceive. Likewise with "devils and demons" too. And this is unfortunately what scuppers many of the mystics and their followers alike. So somehow you have to tread that fine line. You have to be open to it, so you don't close yourself off from having these experiences. But don't be willing to believe to the point of
  <i>
   gullibility
  </i>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  That is why I follow a more scientific line of enquiry. This has stood me in good stead in my attempts to find out what actually IS, as opposed to merely revelling in my own belief constructs ABOUT what is.
  <br>
  <br>
  Okay, I think I have covered everything as best I can. I've tried to provide a fuller explanation than perhaps you were expecting, as when I have the time I'll often let my thoughts run. I've found doing this helps people with what I call side issues. Little things that have been niggling people that just plop into place when they read something or other. I have seen your post up for a few days and had it earmarked as one I wanted to put aside an appropriate amount of time for, where I could expand on my replies to as high a degree as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yours,
  <br>

Interesting stuff Frank. What do you think of Robert Monroe's description of 'graduates'? These are people who had completed their physical world experience and were now residing at a 'higher' level. Monroe was offered a glimpse of them but was warned that their intensity might be too much for him to bear for very long.
<br>
<br>
From what he perceived, these beings/people were now prime *expressers* of the power/force of Unconditional Love.. the Prime Energy of the Universe. As far as Monroe was concerned, he was convinced that our ultimate aim was to go from being able to receive and experience Unconditional Love to actually expressing it. These graduates seemed to spend their time beaming this energy down to where it was needed on Earth i.e. in the physical and other locations. Interestingly, even people in the physical who were in difficult situations, who prayed for help or were seeking some sort of comfort after suffering adversity and so on.. These graduates beamed this energy towards these people (of course the people in question would interpret this love energy via whatever belief system they held).
<br>
<br>
These beings were so intense Monroe could not handle it for long and had to back off.
<br>
<br>
His description sounds like it might be an interpretation of your 'focus 4' region. The difference being that at this time, it was not clear if physical lives were led simultaneously or sequentially, but apart from this, his overall interpretation seems pretty good. I'm sure these 'graduates' are people who have learned to focus in f4.
<br>
<br>
At the moment I still have no idea who the 'inspecs' are however. According to Monroe these guys did a lot of tinkering around with physical reality as well as other areas of consciousness and apparently spent their time 'harvesting' the Unconditional Love energy. They appeared more like intelligent energy 'programs' rather than people, but I don't know how much of this stuff is accurate or not, although Monroe seemed convinced of it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Frank, concerning guides, is it still your opinion that we have several guides or individuals who have been assinged to assist us in this physical lifetime. I remember you thought that before, you said that there were several individuals who had agreed to monitor and attempt to assist you in your time here.
<br>
<br>
If so, then does everyone have such individuals who have agreed to help out? If so, then that would mean that it is worth spending time trying to contact guides to help in personal development. I was never sure about this before.

Doug:
<br>
<br>
The Graduates that Monroe is talking about must surely be people who have adopted Focus 4 of consciousness as their Primary Focus, yes. I can see no other explanation. I am also convinced that Monroe touched on Focus 4 quite a number of times during his experiences but for some reason the penny didn't quite drop with him. With me, it was my frustration in my attempts to go "beyond" F27 of his model that led me into the discovering of Focus 4 of consciousness. Not that I actually saw it as Focus 4 at that time. The label came later. But it was obvious that the area was a completely different area to the Transition area of focuses 23 through 27 of the Monroe model.
<br>
<br>
To feel your whole sense of "body" totally disintegrate is not something you forget in a hurry. :)  This is why I do not recommend beginners attempt Phasing to focus 4. There are no "dangers" don't get me wrong. But the effects are mind blowing and I do not say this lightly. Seeing my whole physical life as a concept changed my outcome on life significantly
<i>
 overnight
</i>
. But reading Monroe's later work he was right on the brink of it in many ways.
<br>
<br>
As I said in my previous post, I accept there are people resident within Focus 4. Pure energy essences you might call them that you can tap into. These people are quite knowledgeable and do come across as kind of "godlike" you could say. But that's only because they are subjective energy essences that exist primarily as a point of consciousness, so to speak. When we each (for want of a better word) "complete" our current movement through consciousness, or as Monroe was saying "graduate" we too will reside within Focus 4 solely as an energy essence, or a point of consciousness. This is simply part and parcel of adopting Focus 4 as your Primary Focus, instead of Focus 1 or Focus 3. But I guess people in the past have just misunderstood what's what.
<br>
<br>
The strange thing is, we actually are now resident as a point of consciousness within Focus 4. We have not in any way "left" Focus 4. What we have done is to adopt a different
<i>
 Primary Focus
</i>
for the purposes of our experience. You can imagine it as one continuum of consciousness that extends, like a telephoto lens, if you like, from Focus 4 through to Focus 1. What we objectively view as "death" in subjective energy terms is an objective translation of the action of a person shifting their Primary Focus from Focus 1 to Focus 3. After your life within Focus 3 you, in a manner of speaking, die again, when you shift your Primary Focus from Focus 3 to Focus 4. And that completes your cycle, you could say.
<br>
<br>
Note: I have to be wary of using terms such as beginning or end, because when you are speaking within the context of Focus 4 these terms simply don't exist. From the point of view of Focus 4, your life here is a movement that you initiate in consciousness for the purposes of your experience.
<br>
<br>
So, again, if I had come across Focus 4 before Freda and Harath had given me a detailed briefing of what to expect, then even I could well have mistaken my interactions as some kind of communication with divine being(s). Because that's precisely the way they come across. They radiate a kind of energy that tends to turn you to emotional jelly. But they are not "gods" as such. The energy they radiate is merely a product of adopting Focus 4 as your primary focus. If any of us chose to do the same, we would radiate the same energetic signature. Well, that is what I am told. I won't actually know until I try it myself, of course. :)
<br>
<br>
What Monroe and company call the Prime Energy of the universe, this is my subjective energy the source of which, as I've mentioned a few times, is Focus 4 of consciousness. I do not subscribe to the "unconditional love" idea as it stems from a more poetic description of the underlying facts of the matter. Which are all I am interested in. Though I should make very clear at this juncture, that many pieces of the Focus 4 jigsaw have yet to fall into place for me. In order to fill in the blanks, as it were, I agree there is the temptation to begin stretching the narrative. It would be a handy release if I did offer myself a degree of poetic license. But I am resisting this temptation entirely in favour of following a strictly scientific approach. Monroe (unfortunately in my view) did occasionally display a love for poetic metaphor and I am determined not to make that mistake.
<br>
<br>
The energy essences that hold Focus 4 as their Primary Focus are not themselves responsible for the radiation of this energy, nor are they the source of this energy. They each are an energetic personality essence and, as such, they are a
<i>
 focus
</i>
of this energy, just as we all are. The only real difference being between us and them, so to speak, is the Primary Focus we choose to hold. I have tried to find out where this energy comes from but no one appears to know. We obviously all evolved from it. Somehow this subjective energy became focused and developed into a kind of primary energetic personality essence and this is, I believe, what all the old mystical works are objectifying and calling "god". Now this primary energetic personality essence somehow began to develop into many, many individual focuses that somehow became us, and all we have created. But as to how it all began, originally, I don't mean how the physical universe began, but how
<u>
 all
</u>
of it began, I simply do not know. I think it never did ever begin. I think the subjective side of things have just always been, which is a pretty mind-blowing concept.
<br>
<br>
Regarding "guides" I dislike using the actual term these days as it's like the word "chakra" in a way. There are just too many mystical belief constructs attached to the point where it all starts getting silly. People talking about everyone having "guardian angels" assigned to them and all that kind of thing. But there are people who will be taking an interest in your journey, let's say. Members of what I call your non-physical family who you can contact within Monroe's focus 27. Here, you will come across all kinds of people who will greet you like an old friend and you haven't the faintest idea who they are. But that's just another thing you get used to. With the whole guide thing you have to be very careful you don't trip up over yourself and start creating various aspects of yourself within Focus 2 in order to fill the need for a "guide". Each of us has many, many different aspects of ourselves that we create within Focus 2 for all manner of purposes. People who subscribe to mystical belief constructs such as a "higher self" often meet aspects they have created within Focus 2 in order to satisfy this purpose (not that they actually see it that way). As a general rule, you have to be very, very careful regarding Focus 2. It's a real sneaky area that can catch you out if you are not careful.
<br>
<br>
The key to not getting caught out is to realise it exists.
<br>
<br>
Many mystics have spoken of this area in terms of its "Alice in Wonderland" effect. But few people have actually stopped to ask WHY that is, exactly. Why do your thoughts come to life? why do these scenarios come about? The simple answer, as we now know, is this place they are calling "the astral" to a large degree is everyone's individual area of mind. That's why your thoughts come to life, that's why you end up in fearful circumstances if you release emotions such as fear. That's why you become embroiled within your own belief constructs. That's why you start seeing devils and demons if you subscribe to the devils and demons constructs and why people never come across them if they don't believe in them, and so on and so on. It didn't actually dawn on people (and it still hasn't with many of the traditionalists) that they are actually within their own mind.
<br>
<br>
You have no higher or lower self. There is only yourself. But people view not only other people in terms of separation, but they even view their own self in that way as well. I can understand the former, but the latter is stretching it a bit. I have sort of subscribed to more modern-day notions of a higher self in the past. But now I realise that what I was doing in my search for my "higher self" was either merging with other focuses or meeting members of my non-physical family as I call them. But still, even though I was a little off track in my thinking. I did come to meet my two guide friends Freda and Harath who ended up helping me loads. So now I'm glad I went off track, which is how it happens sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Many times I have found myself simply lost and stuck for answers so I'll just follow my own nose and see where it leads me. I've had some of my most amazing experiences this way. Problem is, finding yourself very alone and lost in some wider reality somewhere, there is always the tendency to panic. I know only too well how Monroe felt when he hit that wall. I got myself in a similar pickle once and no matter what I tried I simply couldn't get out of it. I pushed every panic button known and nothing was working. I didn't go so far as to start praying and stuff but I admit the thought crossed my mind, which did make me chuckle in the midst of it all the madness that was the situation.
<br>
<br>
The problem is there is no "time" to speak of. You think, oh it doesn't matter my alarm will be going off in an hour, or whatever, and my physical will just zap me back. But linear time simply doesn't apply. You could live within subjective reality for what might seem like a hundred years in just a second or two of linear time. But if you can resist the temptation to panic, which I've got pretty good at over the years as all it takes is practice, then following your own nose can throw up some very interesting experiences.
<br>
<br>
So it does pay to try and get in touch with a knowledgeable person or two within you. But watch out you are not merely engaging in wish fulfilment within Focus 2. Not that there is anything inherently wrong in doing this. Revel in Focus 2 by all means, provided you know that's what you are doing. Much confusion can occur, however, when you think you are meeting "guides" and stuff and you are just revelling within Focus 2 without realising it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

 "With a small twist, it would seem that I could reframe that mindset to experience everything during the day as an intentional Focusing of Consciousness in F1. Am I missing anything with that kind of thought?"
</i>
<br>
<br>
Shinobi:
<br>
<br>
The above is basically how I tend to look at things now. The physical is our Primary Focus so it does capture our focus to a high degree. With many people it captures it to the extent that it precludes them from experiencing anything of the wider reality. But by using various techniques we can gradually break down the barriers between here and there, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
I have got to the stage now where hardly a minute goes by that I'm not thinking about this topic in some way or another. I am not saying that that is strictly necessary in order to be successful. It's just that this topic has become my life now, which is what I wanted. But there is no reason why people cannot be successful from spending less time at it. I do think it important, though, that a person assigns at least a couple of times in the day to just sit quietly and focus within themselves just for 5 or 10 minutes. Even if it's just to create a little rundown in mind aiming to have an F1/F2 overlay experience. This is in addition to the person's main practice, which should be for about 30 to 60 minutes. 45 minutes I'd say is about optimum in one main session each day.
<br>
<br>
Regarding your other point about Image Streaming:
<br>
<br>
F2 images tend to be very symbolic as they are an objective translation of the underlying subjective actions. So I wouldn't bother trying to work them out as you'd spend weeks trying to decipher one. :)
<br>
<br>
I get these kinds of abstract images all the time. Occasionally I get something that's vaguely meaningful but usually pass it all off as just my own subjective ramblings. What I like is to actually make the transition or the switch to Focus 2 and immerse myself within the area. This enables me to revel in all kinds of belief constructs, think up ideas for present and future books, etc. I find it a great workspace. Sometimes I'll get someone wanting answers to something and I might need ideas on how best to present the answer, so I'll put it on my mental list of things to sort out in my next transition to Focus 2. I'll put aside a quiet hour to make the transition, work through what I need to do, and nip back to physical and work on it physically.
<br>
<br>
I actually like the running commentary idea, though I tend to recommend doing it with an internal mental voice. I cannot see anything wrong with actually verbalising except that it will interfere with making the switch. As when you do so, you leave the physical behind, so to speak. So on that basis I guess it could only be the means to an F1/F2 overlay. But it actually sounds like a good idea. I often verbalise concepts or whatever, as I find it can settle things in my mind. Especially with something I'm having difficulties getting to grips with. I find if I actually verbalise it then things can start slotting into place where I was having difficulties before. Though I agree people can often get the wrong idea if they happen to see you doing it! But I think many creative people must use this kind of verbal "tool" as a means of getting ideas straight in one's mind.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps continue with the verbalisation, and then try it the same only using a mental voice. See which one suits. But the actual idea of keeping up a running commentary on what you are perceiving is a good one, IMO. In some of my posts I recommend people do this when "coming awake" within a dream. Keep up a running commentary and ask basic questions about the environment they find themselves in. This helps to bring all their mental faculties on stream. Plus, it also helps to keep the old thoughts in check and concentrates attention on the task in hand.
<br>
<br>
There is no reason why you cannot plumb for an F1/F3 overlay experience. Doing this will enable you to interact with other people within the Transition Area. Bruce Moen's Focused Attention approach teaches people how to have F1/F3 overlay experiences. Bruce's terminology is a little different to my own, but the basic action is the same.
<br>
<br>
Using your verbal technique you could announce, in words that you felt comfortable with, that you wanted to "make contact" with someone and keep up a verbal commentary that was, in a sense, biased along those lines. So you'd still do the noticing aspect and comment on that, but in the verbal commentary you'd throw in hints that to come was some kind of F3 contact, and keep pushing along those lines.
<br>
<br>
The only real difficulty with F1/F3 overlays is believing you are doing it. With me, my imagination keeps stepping in to fill in the blanks, so to speak. I can make a vague contact with not too much difficulty. So then I might ask for the person's name but, as I say, the contact will be a bit vague and the transmission of the information will be indistinct. No problem, says my imagination, I'll fill you in on what I feel is the most likely name. And so it goes. Each time end up in a kind of fight with my imagination that just keeps swamping over the weaker signal, as it were. That's why I find it far clearer to project there. Which is a LOT trickier, I admit. So that's why I teach people to make the F1&gt;F2 switch first, then use F2 as a kind of launch pad to F3.
<br>
<br>
But you never know, you may find you have a bit of a knack for these overlay experiences. If you are seeing abstract images then that's a sure sign of F2, so you only have to pop next door, in a manner of speaking.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hey Frank, Shinobi, Gandalf et al.
<br>
<br>
I cannot possibly comment on what has just been said, however i must say i'm looking forward to the pioneering future that seems to be developing here.
<br>
<br>
I suppose in a way i could consider myself lucky to have no astral experience. I tried a few projection techniques all of which failed.
<br>
<br>
I have no reason for posting this reply, but i was soooo intrigued by this  post i had to say something. Even if it was only WOW
<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, can we coin the term 'Astral Injection' as far as 'going within yourself' is concerned.
<br>
<br>
Thanks guys

 Here, you will come across all kinds of people who will greet you like an old friend and you haven't the faintest idea who they are. But that's just another thing you get used to.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Now THIS I have personal experience of, on several occasions!
<br>
These experiences have occured in the area known as 'the park'. You know you are in f27/upper f3 as there is a feeling of 'life' there, i cant explain it, but but it refers to the 'Unconditional Love energy' or what you prefer to call the 'Subjective Energy Expression'. Basically it feels *alive* like those times when you take a deep breath and think 'gaaad... it feels good to be alive!!!'
<br>
<br>
Well, that kind of feeling seems much stronger the 'higher' (or Wider!) you go and this feeing seems to permeate the upper end of f27/f3.
<br>
<br>
This feeling is not usually as clear in the physical unfortunatly (at least for me!)
<br>
<br>
I really want to know more about these people I meet in 'the park' though. I agree with the idea of an 'astral family'. Now it appears from what you say that everyone has an immense number of different focuses and so on, but it also seems to me on an individual level there is a slightly closer-knit group, involving people who are somehow closer to you as an individual focus, that you can refer to as your 'astral family'. This group of individuals I have come across several times in the 'Park' region but I am always overcome when I meet them and never get much info out of them!
<br>
<br>
They seem pleased though, like 'wow he has managed to come back here even although being physical!' I guess this doesnt happen to most people in the general population, most of whom never focus beyond f2 throughout the course of their physical lives.
<br>
<br>
I also guess that since there is no physical time over there so to speak, it will seem like i just left, even although for me I've been living a lifetime here!
<br>
<br>
One thing i am wondering though Frank, is the 'reincarnation' issue after we rejoin f4. Since we experience many silmultanious lives, I guess we can also create another focus to experience yet more situations/experiences.  But as an individual focus, could I (as in my individual focus) engage in another physical journey somewhere else (not repeat my old one but actualy enter on a whole new one) or would i create another focus for this? I remember you said before that we can relive all these focuses at any time anyway, so maybe it doesnt matter.  btw when I say 'could i..' basically I mean 'is it common for...'. as there are of course no limitations.
<br>

Shinobi,
<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, that's what i have been up to all night. My eyes feel so heavy, its 3:00AM and i have work tomorrow. I feel so excited by it all.
<br>
<br>
I'm just reading a most intriguing post by Major Tom about focus 10.
<br>
<br>
I'm having such a fun time reading and learning... Thanks guys/girls  for this knowledge pool you have created here. For a serious beginner such as myself it is a most rewarding experience.
<br>
<br>
Its funny because i have been interested OBE's and Astral Projection for the longest time. Ever since my Dad told me he involuntarily had them for years after a car crash (He got forced off a bridge by a drunk driver). I might tell that story in another post or something if people would be interested to hear, its very inspiring.
<br>

Is that the Focus 10 in the Sticky section?

That's a nice post from the Major that is. One of the best on the Internet I reckon.

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
It is indeed, the sticky Focus 10 by Major Tom. A most informative read.
<br>
<br>
It's crazy, i feel like Ive just discovered a new country and want to explore all its terrain without stopping. I have just begun reading your FAQ post named 'What is Phasing and how can i do it'. After which, fearing sensory overload i will call it a day.
<br>

I am a kid in a candy-shop, watch me eat!

Ha ha, you sound like I felt when I started projecting for real the first times. Kid in a candy shop, that's about it. Just wait 'til you start switching focus. That's something else again.

 This is the key to all of this, being able to project within Focus 3 as it is an area of common consensus reality. Once we can start meeting up then I'm sure things are really going to take off for us here at the Astral Pulse.

Have you met up with anybody in F3oC yet to test out your theory? I believe I have heard of TMI folks meeting up in F27, which your F3oC encompasses, but have you done this yourself with a fellow traveller?

I have been having a hard time with my rundown. I am basically having trouble picking what I should do for a rundown and, the past few mornings, as I am trying to do the rundown I would somehow remember my physical body and would find myself looking at the back of my eyelids. What was different about this, though, was that I saw a pattern amongst the blackness. It kind of looked like lines arranged in a fingerprint-type pattern, but they were different from hypnagogic imagery since they weren't moving at all. On to my point. The past few mornings that I noticed this, I turned on to sort of a running commentary of what I was experiencing and was able to go a little further before falling asleep. Sometimes I would get to a point where I would be able to perceive things (not see them visually, however) and my running commentary would go for a bit until I ultimately fell asleep. Has anybody else experimented with this? It appears that I am getting further doing this, rather than trying to create something via a rundown.

I have "met" with people I did not know within F3 and have, on occasion swapped information I could not otherwise have known, yes. Which is why I want to now do it on a more wider scale. So we can all feel the benefit of having that same kind of knowledge.

The Jza,
<br>
<br>
For the past few nights whilst closing my eye's to go to sleep i have intentionally 'noticed' and commented on whats been going on in the blackness i first see. I can say i have made progress in these days, but very slight. My biggest problem is falling asleep.
