I had a headache coming on so i took some pain killers. The pain killers were strong and they made me tired. I went to bed and listened to hemisync focus 10 medition tape.  I played it like 4 times just over and over waiting for my body to fall asleep.  Then the vibrations finally came.  They swept from my head down to my toes.  I felt very floaty and I said lift up lift up in my mind then I felt I dont know what is out there.  then the vibrations stopped.  I must remembe to check my emotions all of them.  I was kinda excited too when  I was saying lift up lift up hehe.  But at least I got the vibrations...

Sounds good. Once the vibrational state is reached it's very easy to put a spoke in the works. Basically, you need to just remain neutral and allow the experience to unfold.
<br>
<br>
In other words, there is no need to employ any kind of "exit technique" or give out any mental instructions. At this stage, doing such things can be self-defeating. And remember always to not make any snap-judgements about whatever happens.
<br>
<br>
What should come next is a feeling of movement. This is a critical stage because your protective sense of awareness, chances are, will shout: ENOUGH!!! Whereupon it slaps on the brakes and you get zapped back to C1 consciousness. When I say a feeling of movement, it feels like your body suddenly developed the ability to defy gravity and you literally took-off from where you were laying, and began heading out in whatever direction.
<br>
<br>
As you feel yourself move off, simply continue to allow the experience to unfold. You may chop and change direction so don't be too hasty to think that's it, if you come to a halt. You may stop for a second or two and begin moving again. In a way it feels very much like you are being guided by remote control.
<br>
<br>
Again, throughout this travelling stage, you need to remain neutral and just be mildly curious about where you may be heading. If you come to any snap-judgements, it tends to put a spoke in the works as it spoils the continuity of it all. The best progression is made when you just allow yourself to be guided by the experience. Which is ever so easy to say, but it's quite a tricky mental balancing act (but it all comes good with practice).
<br>
<br>
Also, if you have your sight switched on (don't worry if it isn't at first) your scenary may change. You may find yourself flying through huge swirling clouds of all kinds of colours. Then you might come to what looks like a colourful wall composed of millions of the same kind of shape. As you get closer suddenly a tunnel might open and you find yourself flying through it. Which might open up into something else, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the changing nature of the scenary can sometimes give you the frightful notion you are about to crash into something. But try not to worry about it. This still happens to me on occasion. For example, you'll be flying through a tunnel and it looks like a dead end. Your protective sense of awareness may start to panic thinking you are about to get hurt from crashing into a solid wall.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, as I've mentioned before, when we project we don't automatically develop some super sense of conscious awareness all primed and geared for use within non-physical realms. So if things get a bit sticky while on the move, I just simply close my eyes or quickly turn around so I can no-longer see what's coming.
<br>
<br>
If you manage to see it through, then you should come to a halt within some non-physical realm somewhere. Well, when I say come to a halt you'll probably crash-land and spoil it the first few times. But when you get the landing right, don't be surprised to find yourself surrounded by people, all milling around doing things that look very normal in a planet-Earth sense.
<br>
<br>
This is where the fun begins: breathing the incredible atmosphere of the non-physical realms; chatting with the residents; and maybe meeting a few non-physical friends you forgot you had. It's all very thrilling stuff.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

The first time I really felt movement came after a number of sessions where I was seeing the swirling colors, patterns and hearing the occassional sounds. The movement (for me at least) has been in what I would call a forward direction. It was
<i>
 exciting
</i>
and that was my problem. A part of me started to analyze the situation too.
<br>
<br>
So each time I settle in for astral phasing and start to have these experiences and impressions, I work on maintaining that neutral "mildly curious" state that Frank describes. I can state now from personal experience, that with each session, there appears to be an incremental increase in my ability to maintain the proper state. There will probably be many more times when something new happens and I get too excited, however by identifying the excitement when it happens I can then try to control it.
<br>
<br>
So DOA, I know what you mean about having to remember to check the emotions. All I can add is that I've found that you can get better at it with practice.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

It's just that it seems so far a few in between entering the vibrational state.  Took me for ever to finally get there.  I played the f10 state tape 3 or 4 times.  I did notice that I fell asleep for a few sec before this.  That happened last time too I fell asleep for a few sec first.

Seldom is it that I can achieve a perfectly smooth Phasing transition with absolutely no gaps whatsoever. Often I'll experience a little lapse in consciousness immediately prior to the vibrational state. I think this must be a normal thing.
<br>
<br>
As for the time it took you to achieve this state: in my case, sometimes I'll just fall into it in a few minutes and sometimes it may take an hour or more. I'm still trying to find out what the reason is.
<br>
<br>
This morning, for instance, I was projecting for fun. Had six incredible experiences over a period of about 3 hours. However, last week was difficult, to say the least. I actually had several blank days which is
<u>
 most
</u>
unusual for me. But on the Saturday morning of last week I had my longest ever projection. One which lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes (in terms of Earth-time).
<br>
<br>
On the whole, I would say it has got easier over the years. But I just want to be able to just lay back and do it right away. Oh well, dream on Frank.

Well last night I went to bed with the intention of staying awake till I felt the vibrations.  I went and laid down with the F10 tape and played it and played it and played it.  i also tried mental falling and looking at darkness.  I did this for like 3 hours and finally said ok ill roll over and go to sleep.  Well I wasnt asleep long where i was barley aware of myself lying in bed.  I didnt feel the vibrations but I felt a little differant.  I slowly rolled over and as I rolled over I knew I was leaving my body.  My awarness was kinda dim.  I did the tech where you grab your finger and pull and if you are out of body it should stretch well it didnt hehe I did feel my finger and I felt my knuckle as well.  I then mentally commanded myself to go to front door.  Now I was expecting to go out of bed room and down stairs to the door but I Proceded to go over the bed and my body and out the window.  I got stuck in the window but wiggled my way out and then I went down to the ground.  At this point I still had no sight and as I left the window I got a clear image of it but not sight.  My awarness was around my body no further.  I then was going to move furthur away from the body to get sight and then I woke up.
<br>
What all the occurances had in common from the vibrations to the actual exit in my last successful 4 attempts by successful I mean reaching the vibrations has been I have fallen asleep for the shortest of times.  Could be only seconds but my constant practices have at least allowed some vibrations.  Compared to my previous years I am making great headway.  [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

<br>
So I must learn to master the awake sleep line.  I must learn to get my body asleep and mind awake.  Again tongiht I will go to bed and not sleep unitl i have another vibarational state.

<br>
Full marks for persistence!
<br>
<br>
With me, reaching the vibrational stage was rare when actually listening to the rundown. There were times when I could have let go and projected, but I resisted the temptation and continued with the CD. Then I'd try for real without the CD.
<br>
<br>
The CD, for me, acted best as a kind of mental primer. Something which got me in the mood, so to speak, and served to focus my attention on the task in hand. From what you say I think you might be going down the same route. Ideally, you should be aiming for no gaps in consciousness. However, as I mentioned in my previous post, this is difficult to achieve. With me, the gaps in conscious awareness got progressively less and shorter to the point where, nowadays, they hardly affect my progress at all.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I would strongly suggest you try is, when you get to the vibrational state, simply remain neutral and allow the experience to unfold.
<br>
<br>
Ideally (while I fully respect the fact it
<u>
 is
</u>
your experience and all that) your goal should be (IMO) to move directly away from the real-time zone around your body and travel directly to the Astral. I say this because the Astral is where all the fun-stuff takes place. Okay, it's nice being able to wander about your room and maybe fly over the rooftops in your vicinity. But believe me, all that pales into insignificance by comparison to what you can experience within non-physical realms proper.
<br>
<br>
To go directly to Astral, you need to allow the vibrations to increase in pitch and intensity and, at some point, you will take-off and land within the Astral somewhere.
<br>
<br>
When you next reach the vibrational stage, rather than trying to roll out of your physical body and things like that, simply lay back and relax into the vibrations. With me, I imagine it like I were bathing in them. Then, while the vibrations are continuing, start to breathe in and out, slowly and deeply, and see what happens. If the same happens with you, as it does with me, you should find the breathing has some rather interesting effects vibration-wise.
<br>
<br>
Note: when I say breathe you won't actually be physically breathing in the way you will feel like you are. Though it will come across to you as being the exact same action. In the same way, the vibrations feel like your whole physical body is vibrating. But it isn't actually. It just feels like it is.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck in your attempts.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes I have lost the vibrations on almost all of my attmept becouse of lack of control.  I am so excited that I did it I cant wait to get out or ill have some fear for a second   then they stop.
<br>
<br>
Ideally (while I fully respect the fact it is your experience and all that) your goal should be (IMO) to move directly away from the real-time zone around your body and travel directly to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
well once I have more control over the vibrational stage then I will see where to go.  I know me and if I think too far ahead I lose the moment.  I think that was one of my problems before is fear and lack of concentration.  I had too many things in my mind to do so I am slowing down and doing one thing at at time.  My plan is to get to vibrational stage on a regular basis.  If I project from there that is a bonus.
<br>
<br>
Last night I went to bed but my son wanted to sleep with me so it made the experiment a little more difficult.  I will not say impossible becouse I've still had things happen even with wife or kids next to me.  In fact on one occasion I was laying down with one of my sons and we were drifting off to sleep and I was thinking lift up lift and my son had the jerk awake thing.  I experimented with that on several occasions with differant sons and everytime they would have the jerk awake thing.  So I know my thoughts affected them as well and I could lift there astarl body out of there body.

What are some techniques that you can do to reach the vibrational state (other than monroe technique and cd/tapes)?
<br>
<br>
I'm trying the Monroe technique the way I understand it and so far have gotten extremely short bursts of chi shooting through my body (like cold chills), but not vibrations.  Well kind of, but it is always my eyelids and that is probably just a natural muscle spasm in the eyelids after bringing the point up and over my head.. a false vibration I think.  I seem to be having an extremely difficult time visualizing perfect lines merging into a center point 6 feet away from my forehead (the blackness doesn't look that spacial to me.. except perhaps a shrinking ball of energy but still not anywhere near visualizaton of two perfect lines and a point)

Is the mental falling technique something like this:

Imagine a bugee cord rope susended on your back and holding you up, and then whenever you exhale you feel yourself fall.  Thenw hen you inhale, you feel yourself snap to a stop?

Hey Frank. I read the post of *** (If anyone knows please tell me.) and he said the same thing, that breathing in these states helps. He said that taking deep breaths kind of pushes or pumps his nonphysical body out. Would you elaborate on this. I was under the impression that I would be breathing with my phyisical body. It makes sense- nonphysical is vibrating, nonphysical is breathing.

Thanks Celestial but I have to admit that after those 2 days of intense practice I took almost a week off.  I just had trouble mustering the energy.  I think that has been a problem for me in the past.  I would practice on one technique for like a week or 2 and then I would try another tech.  I need to stick with one technique for like 6 months just practice that one.  I cant stay up every night for hours on end either.  I was getting a headache hehe.  I also noticed that several nights I wouldnt even feel a thing.  So I didnt even bother with trying anymore.
<br>
<br>
Last night I did have a experience tho. I started the Holo-Sync tape called awakenings becouse I read on another thread that obe was delta state and this cd suppose to be all delta.  When I used the F10 tape it was a tape that didnt have automatic rewind so when tape shut off it made a noise enough to rouse me from my light sleep.  I think that helped me wake up enough to realize I was asleep.  The CD player I bought there is no loud shut off.  I noticed I fell asleep during the tape and woke up naturally with the cd not playing.  Well anyway I am having a dream that I am on a ship and it is sailing in night.  There is a storm and I feel the waves.  I look out the cabin window and all i see is dark ocean in front of me.  I ask my wife where we are going she says i set the course I said no I didnt.  I then look out side and the ship is by land and like going down a river.  I am kinda confused where I am and I feel a little fear becouse the waves are high.  I get the feeling of something dark watching me. I wake up at this point and I have alot of fear.  I lay in bed and I have the feeling that I just got over the vibrations.  I realized they had just happened and I realize I was partically out of my body and that was the wave feeling I felt.  I also felt the fear.  I then realized I couldnt feel my tounge.  I felt like my tounge was still in the vibrational state by that I mean I could feel the tip but couldnt feel anything else till the throat.  It really felt like the tounge was just gone.  I swallowed and I felt it and then in a sec or 2 it felt like it was missing again.  Then my wife must have been having a dream as I heard her start to mumble like she is struggling.  I cant help but think the fear I felt and her having a scary dream are related.  I tried my best to reamin calm and to relax and do mental falling to reach vibrational state.  I will not let the fear overtake me and if I let the fear keep mainifesting then it will be harder to project next time.

  Hey Frank. I read the post of *** (If anyone knows please tell me.) and he said the same thing, that breathing in these states helps. He said that taking deep breaths kind of pushes or pumps his nonphysical body out. Would you elaborate on this. I was under the impression that I would be breathing with my phyisical body. It makes sense- nonphysical is vibrating, nonphysical is breathing.

Non-physical realms have an atmosphere which the non-physical body (pertaining to that realm) breathes. Of course, this breathing has got nothing to do with air molecules and lungs. But similar principles apply.
