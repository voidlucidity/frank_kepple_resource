<section>
I have been able to induce OBE's for a while now, and I have lots of lucid dreams as well, but there was always a big differance between the two.  Recently while in a lucid dreams, I find that if I start concentrating on my actual physical body, my awareness snaps into my body, and the vibrations start up automatically, and a OBE takes place.  Anyone else ever experience this transition from lucid dream to astral projection?  So far I've had 100% success rate with it.

<section>
thats the first lucid to obe technique ive heard of that involves going back to your physical body.. i have a little experience with lucid dreams, so ill have to see if that works. it certainly sounds as though it does. i've sort of slipped out of the lucid dream streak i used to have going, so i'll have to get myself back into it and try that!

<section>
Ive only had two lucid dreams to date, but then Ive only started doing reality checks about ten days ago. The first time I thought to project from the LD and found myself in the RTZ for a very short time.The second time I thought to project and found myself back in physical, not near exit. So for me, I think, perhaps another way of transforming LD's into full projections is needed. Any suggestions?

I also found out that when I'm aware I'm in a dream and try to reach for my physical body I would get out. Usually there is no vibration. Just the body loosen up and float. Sometimes I fall from the bed left and right while keep trying to get back to bed to sleep.[|)]

Yes, loads of times, and it is a very valid way of projecting provided you go about it the right way.
<br>
<br>
Before I started investigating the Phasing approach "waking up" during a dream was a method I used for years. It was these experiences which taught me that dreams were actually Astral projections, but with a very much reduced level of realisation ability and conscious control.

<section>
This is the only way I've gone astral. And I actually was doing the technique without knowing what I was doing. It's very natural for me. But I don't go back to my physical body like you describe. I also don't ever feel the physical sensations that you all describe here. For me, when I realize I'm dreaming, all I have to do to go astral, is close my eyes and 'sink' within myself.
<br>
<br>
Usually I'll inhale deeply in the dream, then close my eyes as I exhale slowly. And as I exhale, I feel myself sinking deep inside my body (not sure how else to describe it) but I open my eyes afterwards and I'm in the astral.
<br>
<br>
I also hadn't experienced any of the gateways described in the AD book, until three days ago. I was lucid in a dream. I closed my eyes, like normal, but as soon as I did there was a bright light shining in my face. I was afraid to open my eyes for fear that it was on my physical body. But I opened them and was standing at the entrance of a tube. It was very bright with swirling golden and pearl white colors almost in a paisly design. I have a few questions on that experience that I'll post seperately.
<br>
<br>
Then last night I went astral from lucidity and found myself above a plane entrance. This one was red and white. That one didn't last long though, as I woke up soon thereafter.
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps!

I have been fortunate to have experienced many lucid dreams. On several occasions I have projected out of body from a lucid dream. In my experience the best way to project is to first begin flying (or floating) in the lucid dream. Then practice a mental exercise of shifting consciousness out of body. It works but it's a tricky method which I only succeed in using on a few occasions. [?]

<section>
Greytraveller -- you mentioned something I forgot to add in my description - floating/flying. The same thing applies to me. When I want to project, I will float or fly. Then, as I'm doing that, I close my eyes and do the 'sinking' thing. I know I'm not describing that well at all. But anyways, its a very short period of time. Then when I open my eyes, I'm in the astral. I never tried doing it while standing in a lucid dream. So I'm not sure if that would work.

Greytraveller--
<br>
<br>
What is the easiest method for you to induce lucid dreams?  Just wake up 3 or 4 hours earlier than usual, stay awake for about 40 minutes, and then go back to sleep playing out the previous dream (if you remember it..i only remember bits and pieces of mine and i use those to look for dreamsigns) in your head and looking for dreamsigns.. and imaginging yourself performing reality checks within the dream itself?

<section>
for me it is just the opposite order....i usually go from RTZ into lucid dreams.....i go astral right away then wait around for the dreams to start still fully aware.....on rare occasions i have gone back to rtz too.....

<section>
Graupel -
<br>
The best way to induce a Lucid Dream is to notice any Inconsistency or Incongruity in a dream. An Incongruity is anything that you would not experience in person in the waking world.
<br>
For instnce some incongruities are -
<br>
Monsters or mythical creatures,
<br>
Playing major league professional sports,
<br>
Acting in a movie or a tv show,
<br>
Being a participant in a historic event,
<br>
Meeting a historical person or dead celebrity.
<br>
When you consciously notice an ingruity then you realize that it is a dream and are lucid !

<section>
Do you program your mind to reocgnize those incognutiies by doing reality checks (thus programming it into your mind where you might trigger the check in a dream) and thats it?

There have been a number of times I've experienced flying in dreams. Then, I become lucid and start to try to contol my flying i.e., where to, how high. Invariably, my ability to control movement isn't the best when I'm doing this, such as flying over treetops. I'm still not sure though whether or not these flying "dreams" turned into actual obes.

First off: Great thread topic

<br>
<br>
I have projected in this way several times, and it is a preferred method of separation for me. When I become aware enough in the dream to do it, it works every time with me, also.
<br>
<br>
Hey Nick. [

<br>
<br>
We speak of focusing as if on your physical body while in the dream, and you will actually latch-on to your etheric body and you can roll out into real-time, or sit up into real-time, for instance. So while flying, you would focus as such and suddenly be lying in your bed again, but separate from your physical body. Then you can displace.
<br>
<br>
Take care.
<br>
<br>
P.S.

And Novice. You seem like no 'novice' to me! [:O]

(And would you please elaborate more on the entrance structures you've found? I'll start another thread in OBE Discussions for this purpose.)

Usually when I try to fly within a dream something always goes wrong.. like I can't fly over a tree or something or I can't fly as high as I want to as there is this "force" that is keeping me down.
<br>
<br>
Usually in my dream when something like that happens I am too absorbed in the dream itself that I would not know how to become lucid.  Should reality checking solve this and put a habitual action into my mind where I would perform it in a dream?

I don't think I posted details on the plane one. I'm not sure it should go here or not. Let me know where you want me to post it and I will.

Hey Graupel.
<br>
<br>
"Usually when I try to fly within a dream something always goes wrong.. like I can't fly over a tree or something or I can't fly as high as I want to as there is this "force" that is keeping me down."
<br>
<br>
That is actually- as per my experience- that you are still partially in your etheric body, which is maybe with your ph body. Intend to become aware when you experience this 'heaviness,' and then you can focus on your eth. body and do what we speak of. This can be your reality check and your lucid to OBE, as it is very noticible as you know. I have felt 'droggy' or 'restrained' in my actions many times in dreams, and when I go back to my real-time/etheric body I find that it is in paralysis; thus the feeling of restriction of movement. Then I can release and separate. [

One method I use is I clear my mind much the same way you do when trying to project or get into trance state.  Often I'll see the scene around me peel away slowly and im back in my room.  From there I guess i could enter my physical body but i usually dont.  I mean I trust what many have said about treating dreams as an OBE especially lucid ones.
<br>
<br>
I dont want to risk going back into my body and wasting a good lucid dream.. just in case Im not able to project back out.

Graupel -
<br>
regarding incongruities in dreams.
<br>
Yes that is EXACTLY the concept for reality checks (also called state tests). By continually checking on being awake it will be MUCH easier to notice anything WAY out of place in a dream. For that reason many accomplished lucid dreamers pratice reality checks several times a day. [
