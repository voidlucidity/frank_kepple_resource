Hi there ^_^.
<br>
<br>
I've been into "otherworldly" things, and consider myself a "new ager" by a few definitions of the term for about 3 years now. I've read lots of things and experienced a bit (but nowhere near as much as some people in here) and I know quite a fair bit. If anything I have definitely grown into a more spiritual person, relating my problems every now and then to the spiritual and finding solutions via my theories and ideas through spirituality.
<br>
<br>
I've been interested in astral projection for a good while now, but I can't help but feel that the entire field is, rather dangerous.
<br>
<br>
For those of you that want to say that it isn't dangerous because "all is love" and "nothing can harm you," I don't want to hear it. I've heard it before, and find it tough to swallow. For those who want to say that it isn't dangerous out of experience, well, then we have a case.
<br>
<br>
I say dangerous not because your physical or even your mental health could be at huge risk, but because of the sorts of experiences you can have to do with all of this. Some of them I would consider...traumatic.
<br>
<br>
I was haunted for a long time. I don't remember how long. I thought it was a phobia or something but something else told me it was another being. Perhaps I created this other being - I don't know. Either way, I would have nightmares about aliens, "greys" or "zetas", the kind of big-headed ones that so many people are going on about. People suggested I read about them and try to find out more. It worked for about one night when I discovered some cool things about aliens and figured they weren't so bad. Then I read some more and had nightmares even worse than before.
<br>
<br>
Things like this is what I'm talking about. Someone once posted here on the AP how "everybody who delves into the astral has at least one experience that will scare the living sh** out of them." I don't want to be scared this much. Especially in scenarios such as astral projection where everything is so real. It's not like a dream where you can wake up and dismiss it. It's a hands-on experience into the frightening.
<br>
<br>
It's also the fact that everything is so unknown. I don't want to get certain gemstones because of their "psychic amplification" abilities which are supposed to be able to reach "angels, spirit guides, and extra terrestrial beings" very easily. I don't want to attract unwanted attention, but the problem with spirituality like this is that every single thought of yours can be considered a potential summoning ritual for something you don't want.
<br>
<br>
Even if you briefly, for a second, want something, it can be dangerous in this field, it seems. Take for example, you see a hot woman. You look at her. You want her. Then you look back at your girlfriend. The desire is gone, and you realize you care more about your partner than about some very attractive woman, because your relationship with your partner has substance. The same goes for me sometimes. Sometimes I wish I could meet an alien to find the truth. But then I remember that I'd rather not be deceived, abducted, paralyzed, toyed with, or have mind games played on me. I'd rather not accidentally attract negs either.
<br>
<br>
See what I'm driving at? This entire area of study seems riddled with traps that are incredibly frightening, which makes them dangerous to me, but not only that, the traps are triggered by THOUGHT. And not just long-dwelling though, aimless thought. Even if there is intent there for a second it seems impossible to undo what you've already wished for.
<br>
<br>
I feel like if I say "I wish I could meet an alien" in my head then I won't be able to stop that from happening to me in my dream scape or the astral world.
<br>
<br>
I don't know, I've lost my point here....
<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just trying to say - I'm frightened by all of what this could bring into my mind. I'm scared of being scared sh**less, and scared of having to go through experiences that will traumatize me. I'm not strong enough to just sit back and become understanding and learn from experiences that would have made most people insane. I'm scared I can go insane if I have one of those experiences.
<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm asking for here is help and reassurance that what I originally thought about all of this stuff was correct, and that I'm safe from all the terrible stories I keep hearing from people.
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I mean no offence but I do believe that someone with your kind of mindset should not engage in this kind of practice. I have no desire whatsoever to impose limitations upon your experience. But I can say that if you begin projecting with that kind of mindset, running into deep water is not a question of if, but when.
<br>
<br>
Myself, I went down the "negs" route when I first set out. It took me almost 5 years before the penny dropped and I've had no problems ever since.
<br>
<br>
I've said here a number of times before about how I used to kick myself thinking of how it took me almost 5 years to realise something so darned obvious. But now, looking back, I realise how lucky I was for it to have only have taken me 5 years. Many people I suspect
<i>
 never
</i>
realise and suffer all manner of problems as a result. That is why I detest the mystics who perpetuate this kind of thing. They package people's fears in a form they can buy while claiming to present a solution.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Greetings Pheonix!

<br>
Well, you seem to have a lot of fears, and really I am not surprised after sitting here myself reading through old posts.
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
I would like to tell you that I have been meditating and the like for over 10 years.  I have a natural psychic gift which I've been aware of most of my life.  Personally, I don't come across all this negative stuff.  I meet people who have troubles, and I help them, but I have never had a huge scary experience which has made me go "hmm, maybe I should stop doing this".
<br>
<br>
I think that if you approach things with an attitude of love, of wanting to help, of looking for good, then you won't have anything to worry about.  If you sit there and worry yourself silly over what may happen, then I wouldn't bother going any further with it.  Leave the fear behind and you'll be right.

<br>
<br>
Hope that this is of some help to you.  I do honestly understand where you are coming from.
<br>
<br>
Light and love,
<br>
W.O.L

I agree W.O.L.! In my experiences it is sort of a "negativity attracts negativity" thing. If you go into in with an open mind and a happy outlook chances are nothing will scare the sh** out of you.
