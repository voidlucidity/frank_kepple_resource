Hi
<br>
<br>
I started a new thread last night in the OBE Discussions forum entitled "Astral Projection - the Pioneers".  But it has disappeared this morning!  Any body know anything about this?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

Thanks clandestino!  I could have sworn it disappeared.  Anyway I reposted it in the GOOD BOOKS thread where it might get better visibility.  As I think you are aware, Muldoon's book was a world-beater at the time...
<br>
<br>
Frank - the thread seems to have reappeared!  It was just a simple post recommending books by the two early pioneers Muldoon and Fox
<br>
<br>
Frank - that edit/delete feature is fun isn't it!!!!

Ha ha,
<br>
<br>
I just realised what happened, we now have double the number of threads to a page. I'm not sure when that change took place but I have only just now noticed it! Amazing, the force of habit!
<br>
<br>
I was looking for your thread and scrolling down for the same length of posts as I would normally do, then flipping the page. Not realising that I was missing a whole bunch of posts that wouldn't have normally been there. It's incredible how something can be right before your eyes yet you can't see it, because your not in the habit of it. Talk about reality being formed from expectations! LOL
<br>
<br>
I'm glad the post was found anyhow.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
