Hope everyone is having a great day.
<br>
<br>
My latest experience today with Phasing seemed to be snippets of focus 2.  I seemed to have had lucid dreaming moments first person but they very short and quick then I would be back to focusing behind my eyes but still deeply relaxed.
<br>
<br>
My question is about imagination use.  I have read that you should not create in your imagination.  Is it really a bad thing if it keeps you focused so to speak?  I noticed if I have created my world and I just hang out I begin to lose attention into it.  This is when I may create a garden

and start watering it or water flowers so that I can engage senses or I walk along and further create the world just so I am not going around in a circle so to speak.   .
<br>
<br>
I apologize if this has been covered.  I have been searching and only read talk about not creating in your scenario.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.

Thanx Tom
<br>
<br>
I guess its really experience and time that is going to answer some of the questions on my mind right now

<br>
<br>
I like the rundown but I guess because I am not quite at f12 or deep f10 at the end I tend to loose concentration in my scene and then start creating to fill the time so to speak.
<br>
<br>
I am going to work on my patience and work on the rundown and then begin the noticing exercise.
<br>
<br>
The noticing exercise is something else that I am not 100% sure on even though I read a number of posts on.  I have the idea that a normal meditator is probably doing the same thing when they quiet the mind and remove themselves from the physical.  I assumed that a good meditator is entering focus 2 at times and this being the astral plane in esoteric terms.

Jeff:
<br>
<br>
In addition to what the Major has said, you need to be a little bit careful that you do not begin merely entering into a kind of creative visualisation action. This, in Phasing Model terms, would be an F1/F2 overlay.
<br>
<br>
For example, I have an extremely vivid imagination. I can sit here now and imagine all manner of scenes "in my head" so to speak. But this is not making what I call "the switch", which is the action of transitioning your focus of mental attention out of Focus 1 and into Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Your imagination faculty is situated in Focus 2 of consciousness. This is the area of consciousness where most people dream and have their basic "astral projection" style experiences, lucid dream experiences, etc. Focus 2 of consciousness is also the region where people meet all their devils and demons, and whatever else besides.
<br>
<br>
Now, knowing that your imagination is situated in Focus 2 of consciousness, what we do is create a little mental rundown that engages our senses within the rundown to the extent where it captures our focus of attention. As it captures our focus of attention we make "the switch" and kind of, go to "meet" our imagination.
<br>
<br>
So the idea is not to just simply remain in the physical creating all manner of pretty pictures in our imagination. What we want to do is to actually "step into" our imagination. Not just lie back and view it as if from a distance.
<br>
<br>
Generally, if a person is losing concentration in their rundown then they need to make the rundown more engaging, more captivating. I mean, provided your physical body is fairly relaxed. You could make your rundown as captivating as you like, but if you were riding pillion on a motorbike then not much is going to happen in the way of making a transition. :)
<br>
<br>
That is why I tend to practice this only when my physical body is fairly relaxed anyway. After about 6 or 7 hours of sleep is my most common time and often I do it now about 2 hours before I would normally want to sleep.
<br>
<br>
If I want to be active, physically, then I get restless and give up. I can't be bothered doing it, I'll have a list of things to do and a full day and I want to get active and get on with it. So under those circumstances I would find it next to impossible because I simply want to be physically focused. But later on, when I've done all I can for the day, then that's the time to lie back, relax, and take a trip over to the other place and see what's what.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
