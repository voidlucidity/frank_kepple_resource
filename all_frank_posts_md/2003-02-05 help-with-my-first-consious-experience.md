<section>
As a child of no more than 11 or 12, my father used to play a party game using astral projection and hypnosis.
<br>
This was a lot of fun for me and my sister who were happy to go under and my father would use suggestions for us to play with. This started as "imagine leaving you body" "see how high you can go" "what can you see" etc...the high-light I remember, was being able to read all the book titles and autors from the book shelf in another room.
<br>
Now I'm 35 and have had an awaking of late which has lead me back to the path of Astral Projection.
<br>
Whilst laying in bed trying to relax and get in the right state of mind, I've had a couple of near experiences. The latest was seeing my feet and body levitate as if pivoting from my head, which was firmly rooted to the pillow. At the same time my whole body was alive with most intence pins and needles, an amazing buzz of energy and whoosh of noise and the most intence white light. At my excitement at realising what was happening my consiousness took control and everything faded.
<br>
I would welcome anyone who can give me some enlightenment on how to stop my excitement and just let it happen. I have so much in my head for what I want to do, see and meet there after but need to get over this hurdle.
<br>
Many thanks in advance
<br>
Regards Len

You could always try having so many astral experiences
<br>
that you would just not be excited when it happens...
<br>
just spend all night standing on your head [

].
<br>
<br>
You should definitely try intent - it is the strongest
<br>
thing your mind has - before doing anything astral just
<br>
say " I want to be calm when I reach level so and so.. " or
<br>
"I will AP tonight, I
<u>
 will
</u>
go to this place...".
<br>
Even though I havent projected for a LONG time I do remember
<br>
that if you tell your body/mind to do something they listen!
<br>
<br>
Good luck
<br>
you did it once, you can do it again

something similar happened to me (the time gap) and when i first started having spontaneous sensations/exits again, i was excited and therefore came back to my body. what helped me to first of all "induce" these sensations was to think really really hard about the feelings i got when i was younger and they would happen. since they were so profound in my life when i was a child, i was easily able to remember what they were like. secondly just reading peoples experiences helps me calm down whenever i have these sensations because i just think to myself "everything is ok, this is normal".

I think this is a phase virtually everyone goes through, including myself. With me, it was gaining familiarity with the process which eventually led to my being able to handle all the various sensations. In other words, it was just a question of practice, practice and even more practice.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, your protective sense of awareness tends to switch into hyperdrive; and this area of consciousness also has the facility to directly effect your emotions, which can make for quite a heady-mix. Then couple this with the fact that it's all happening on a root-consciousness level, and you tend to find yourself in situations where there are no quick-fix solutions.

It's ok to feel as though you are smiling from ear to ear. And listen to the sounds as your moving inward, the swooshing and pulsing can keep you calm. I used to try to frown, so I wouldn't get all excited when things started to change. But I think frowning turned into an emotion, so now I just let it go like a leaf floating with the wind. Keep the rush of emotions behind you, keep your conscious quiet but alert, and just enjoy what happens.
<br>
<br>
good luck....

Hello
<br>
I like the frowning idea.  What I found to be of great help is to adopt a 'back seat' attitude to the ride.  In other words, as things happen, sit back and become a passive observer - don't get caught up by the 'wow' of the moment.  (Easier said than done of course).  Once you've got this then the intent can come into place with force.  Intent in the moment - so as you experience the obe/ap you determine then and there what your intention is and make it so.
<br>
<br>
I think its really helpful to know what you want before you attempt to go OoB.  It took me a while to determine what I really wamted from this - reading through many oft he posts on this site was a massive help in is regard.
