Hail Astral Pulse.
<br>
<br>
My name is Chad, but many know me by the abbreviated form of Perversion Of Evil, which is Poe.  Poe stands for many things and the assorted meanings intertwine and mingle to form a suitable apparition in the face of a soul seeking threat.  The abbreviation also means, "Principles Of Existence".
<br>
<br>
I have had some bizarre but refreshing dreams which many would consider OBE, and myself am wondering if perhaps they truly are an Astral experience.  I am looking forward to reviewing certain aspects of your forum and I am delighted that you exist.
<br>
<br>
For being young I have experienced a fair sum of life altering.  While I am diagnosed as a Paranoid Schizophrenic I can tell with an accurate recollection of past events that the soft and mysterious bother that inserts and displays a measure of cunning suggestions is in fact a dangerous telepath.  In my Astral experiences I have noticed that I do not have control over this manifested form, and so I believe that it was just a dream.  But the possibility exists wherein the telepath may have full control over my spiritual faculty, and that is why my memory and concentration has been depleted since his arrival in my life.
<br>
<br>
The story which I have to tell is long and seemingly complicated, when I am ready to divulge the secrets of my life you may see them here, and judge for yourself as to their validity.
<br>
<br>
I do hope that I get a response to this, a greeting of some sort.
<br>
<br>
Also, while I do not expect you to join my forums I will post some links here that will perhaps give you a little more insight into the type of mind that I possess.  I am a aspiring revolutionist, seeking a global turmoil in which all men are united in the pursuit of peace and the fulfillment of spiritual ecstasy, enlightenment, and power.  Here are the links, please investigate the words which I have written on these Geocities, but I ask of you to understand that even this so appearing finished product is just rough work and subject to change at my whim and pleasure.

I did not come here for the sole purpose of posting links and spamming your board, but I will use this topic to display the story of my life, ensuring that I include numerous details as to the construct of the supernatural aspects which have pervaded the essence of my thoughts since a young age.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading this, and if you have examined the material on the Geocities then I thank you greatly for that consideration.

Thank you for the greeting.
<br>
<br>
I have seen 'Hail' used by several Pagans and even before that I myself have used it for it seems a bold and fitting introduction.
<br>
<br>
And BTW, upon checking out the FAQ I have discovered that this Phasing thing is pretty much exactly like one of the back up ideas I had been developing for those who Astral project.  So, once again, I am horribly defeated by my 'ancestors'... which is fine, it is possible that every thing which I have thought of has been thought of before.  So, kewl dudes.

Hi, Po is actually my favourite Teletubby, because she is full of personality and yet very soft. But underneath that soft exterior lies a total maniac who is up for anything. A bit of an adrenaline junkie, like me. Plus she can dance, and when it comes to being the first to splash in a puddle then she is up for it, no messing about.
<br>
<br>
Hail is a greeting whose sell-by date expired during Roman times and the word "kewl". Well, does anyone actually say kewl any more? A bit too 90s for my tastes but I'm sure there are still the odd one or two using it, lol. :)
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum, hope you like it here!

The original idea I'm sure can be entirely attributed to Monroe. I forget now exactly which page in which of his two later books he said it. But projection became, for him, like "switching phase" between the physical and the non-physical. In recognition of his work, I named my model the Phasing Model of Consciousness and it would come as no surprise if others who had walked in Monroe's footsteps to any significant extent incorporated this thinking also.

Yeah, on the general point agreed.
<br>
<br>
Talking of original terms, I read on old edition of The Projection of the Astral Body a few months ago by Sylvan Muldoon &amp; Hereward Carrington. This book was first published in 1929 and the book I have here, sent to me by an Astral Pulse member dates from the 1970's.
<br>
<br>
In it are details of a "Rope Technique" almost exactly as described by Robert Bruce in Astral Dynamics some 20 years later. When I look at the publisher's Imprint it states, "Century Hutchinson Publishing Group (Australia) Pty Ltd. Funny that, Robert Bruce living in Australia and all.
<br>
<br>
Plus, get this, they have an old book long out of print called, wait for it, "Psychic Self Defence". The plot thickens, ha ha ha.

Not sure about the current situation. Must be a matter of public record somewhere. Have to tread a little carefully and make clear I am speaking in my personal capacity as a member and NOT as a moderator. But the two of them I believe did have a little legal wrangling, let's say, over something that Mr Bulman unfortunately overlooked.
<br>
<br>
On a strictly personal level, from the rather obnoxious threats I have seen Robert Bruce issue to people then I would put nothing past him. He likes to be seen as the "guru". Like all these "gurus" they have a public face and a private face.
<br>
<br>
I remember a few years ago Robert Bruce was likening himself or at least directly associating himself with that Sai Baba bloke in India. This is the very same person the British Foreign Office were warning people about as a suspected child molester. Certainly makes you think. Several people have reportedly died after being sexually molested by Sai Baba and then Robert Bruce directly claims an association with this person.
<br>
<br>
I quote:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Tom Sackville, a former Home Office Minister, last night urged the Government to take decisive action to warn teachers and pilgrims of the dangers of becoming involved with Sai Baba. The guru's reputation is plummeting after the United Nations cancelled a conference at his headquarters, issuing a condemnation of his alleged sex abuse of youths and boys.
 <br>
 <br>
 Unicef pulled out of a conference it was due to sponsor with the guru's educational organisation in Puttaparthi last September. The UN's cultural agency issued a trenchant statement: 'The organisation is deeply concerned about widely reported allegations of sexual abuse involving youths and children that have been levelled at the leader of the movement in question, Sathya Sai Baba.
</i>
<br>
<br>
This is the same person that Robert Bruce claims or at least claimed a distinct association with. I'm not sure if he still does, but the question of whether Robert Bruce has ever been involved in this kind of sexual abuse of youths and boys, as is alleged in the United Nation's report, should be asked I feel. At least if only to clear the air. We obviously cannot entertain child sex abusers on this forum or even people who associate themselves with such.
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce continues to refuse to issue a specific denial as far as I am aware.
<br>
<br>
I can only find one thread on this forum pertaining to the matter and RB refers to Sai Baba in glowing terms and refers to him as his spiritual friend. Robert Bruce, in that post, advises people not to believe what we read on the Internet. But we are talking about the British Foreign Office and the United Nations. This is not some youngster broadcasting some UFO-style conspiracy theory on a free website. This is the BRITISH GOVERNMENT and the UNITED NATIONS!!!
<br>
<br>
Unless, as a "guru" he feels above all that kind of stuff. Like, the United Nations and UNICEF are beneath him. Ha ha ha, maybe he does think like that. Who knows what ego-trips these gurus get off on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
I'm not taking sides here, but has Robert Bruce actually claimed to have ever physically visited or spent time with Sai Baba?  I mean, if not, that's sort of like saying people who like Michael Jackson's music are child molesters.  Bruce should be careful of who he claims an association with, but to say that he needs to deny ever abusing children (because he claims some spiritual friendship with someone he has perhaps never seen) seems a bit of a stretch.
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
Of course, I don't have all (or even many) of the facts, but it's a pretty serious allegation.

 Yes, the term "phasing" was introduced somewhere in the heading of a section of Ultimate Journey. As such, he deserves the credit for inventing the term as well as the term OBE (together with Charles Tart).
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
I read a little bit about Charles Tart, he is the first one to have tried a strict laboratory protocol in relation with OBE, the results did not bring any ''empirical results'' (like the scientist might say) but the experiment did bring some hypothesis that there is something going on.... I just hope that they could do more experiments like that, it probably do not cost that much!  Instead of trying to throw a 1 billion$ piece of metal on a planet where nobody lives....

Ben:
<br>
<br>
I would invite you to consider that we are talking about the UNITED NATIONS and UNICEF and the BRITISH GOVERNMENT. We are not talking about some kid on a UFO fix here. This is real, like the UNITED NATIONS. You must have heard of them. They are the real deal. You get what I mean.
<br>
<br>
Here is what Robert Bruce has to say about Sai Baba on this very web forum. Remember, he has never specifically denied that he has been involved with child abuse.
<br>
<br>
I quote:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 So all this must be put down to heresay, no matter how convincingly some websites may present these allegations.
 <br>
 <br>
 Do not believe everything you read on the net.
 <br>
 <br>
 I contacted the Sai Baba organization (a US branch), and inquired as to why no defense is offered against these allgations. All Sai Baba followers have been given strict instructions to ignore these allegations and not to enter into discussions over same. I have only found two quotes by Sai Baba concerning this matter:
 <br>
 <br>
 1. "Swami is pure."
 <br>
 <br>
 2. "when you dig a big hole, you always end up with a big pile of dirt next to it."
 <br>
 <br>
 Sai Baba prefers to turn the other cheek and ignore the dirt.
</i>
<br>
<br>
End quote.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, I invite people to consider the following eyewitness testimony:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 There can be no doubt that money, which alone oils the wheels of politics and privilege in India, buys many favours. That SB was able to escape scot-free from the investigations of the police and the CBI into the murders under his very nose, and that the many sworn affidavits of victims of sexual abuse by him can make no headway in India, speaks its own language. That language is the one that talks loudest in India!
</i>
<br>
<br>
I would invite people also to take account of the warnings that you can freely see on the Internet from the BRITISH GOVERNMENT and the UNITED NATIONS and decide for yourself about Mr Sai Baba and anyone who claims to support him.
<br>
<br>
For example, more eyewitness testimony of hundreds you can read from the Internet:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 It is interesting to note that Sai Baba used the same deceptive and forceful technique of shoving his penis into the mouth of the 15 year old California boy. Both boys had been asked to take Padnamaskar and touch and kiss Sai Baba's feet. When they were allowed to rise up on their knees, Baba suddenly raised his robe and displayed his penis and the boys were then instructed to kiss it, after which he forced it into their mouths.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Anyone who associates themselves with anyone who is under serious suspicion of such practices 'aint welcome here that's for sure. The evidence is there for all to see

*seems to pull a slick of moisture from his tongue and touches his eyes, then rubbing his fingers off to his side*
<br>
<br>
While I do appreciate the information on the specifics of the terms I must say that all this talk of child molestation is most distasteful.  Sexual perversion is only a weak gateway to a higher and more dangerous way of action, and as such it is something to be avoided with focus placed on the sensory mediums and the vibratory levels of reality.  Oh, how I yearn for the glory of a levitation, the great spiritual freedom of an Astral projection... *sigh*.
<br>
<br>
My ideas about Reality and Existence I will show you people, and you may learn whatever is possibile from the things that I write.  For a long time I have been interested in Psionic Ability, and to me all this psychic activity is a measure of specialized brain waves.  But I seek a spiritual source... some hidden power beyond kinetics but having an effect on kinetic values.
<br>
<br>
I am a vain and despicable form of futile human.

<section>
I don't mean to seem obstinate, and I wasn't calling into doubt whether Sai Baba has enslaved and violated every child south of the equator.  I get that.  I'm just saying, simply because Robert Bruce stands up for him (Sai Baba) does not make ROBERT BRUCE a child molester, nor (I believe) does it warrant making an INFERENCE that he's a child molester.  That he (Bruce) has very poor judgment in not believing the British government, UNICEF, the UN, etc., in their accusations against Sai Baba can certainly be inferred.  That he (Bruce) molests kids (or should come under suspicion of molestation) because he obstinately refuses to believe clear evidence that Sai Baba is a molester, seems like a breakdown in logic.

No, in this case Poe stands for either Perversion Of Evil, or Principles Of Existence.  Those Poes in turn have multiple meanings and applications.
