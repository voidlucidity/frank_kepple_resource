Your primary VALS type is Experiencer, and your secondary type is Striver.

<section>
Somewhat. I'd go with Actualizer/experiencer. Or maybe the other way around. That's much closer to reality in my case.
<br>
I'll take the test again in a couple of days. I tend to test differently as time goes by.
<br>
<br>
You?

I do think of myself as an experiencer, but I am not sure what the "striver" part means.  I do strive, but somehow it seems to have a negative connotation on this test- or maybe I am mistaken.  Anyhow, it is interesting.

<section>
I do not think Striver is a bad thing.  To me it represents a person who is always looking.  One who searches for either the new, better, or more refined way.
<br>
<br>
Your primary VALS type is Maker, and your secondary type is Striver.
<br>
<br>
The primary VALS type represents your dominant approach to life. The secondary classification represents a particular emphasis you give to your dominant approach.

"Striver" was my primary result. I can see how it might not be as good as "actualizer" because it involves more effort for less satisfaction. Even so, it is the result I came up with and it is what I have to work with.

Here's me . . . kinda cool . . . btw the type descriptions are on the VALS survey pages, just point-and-click . . .
<br>
<br>
Actualizers are successful, sophisticated, active, "take-charge" people with high self-esteem and abundant resources. They are interested in growth and seek to develop, explore, and express themselves in a variety of ways—sometimes guided by principle, and sometimes by a desire to have an effect, to make a change.
<br>
<br>
Image is important to Actualizers, not as evidence of status or power but as an expression of their taste, independence, and character. Actualizers are among the established and emerging leaders in business and government, yet they continue to seek challenges. They have a wide range of interests, are concerned with social issues, and are open to change. Their lives are characterized by richness and diversity. Their possessions and recreation reflect a cultivated taste for the finer things in life.

Okay, this is what I got:
<br>
<br>
Actualizer/Fulfilled
<br>
<br>
Your primary VALS type is Actualizer, and your secondary type is Fulfilled.
<br>
<br>
The primary VALS type represents your dominant approach to life. The secondary classification represents a particular emphasis you give to your dominant approach.
<br>
Actualizers
<br>

They are interested in growth and seek to develop, explore, and express themselves in a variety of ways—sometimes guided by principle, and sometimes by a desire to have an effect, to make a change.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Fulfilleds
<br>
<br>
Fulfilleds are mature, satisfied, comfortable, reflective people who value order, knowledge, and responsibility. Most are well educated and in (or recently retired from) professional occupations. They are well-informed about world and national events and are alert to opportunities to broaden their knowledge. Content with their career, families, and station in life, their leisure activities tend to center around the home.
<br>
<br>
Fulfilleds have a moderate respect for the status quo institutions of authority and social decorum, but are open-minded to new ideas and social change. Fulfilleds tend to base their decisions on firmly held principles and consequently appear calm and self-assured. While their incomes allow them many choices, Fulfilleds are conservative, practical consumers; they look for durability, functionality and value in the products they buy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh well, here's to the next one, Dan.
