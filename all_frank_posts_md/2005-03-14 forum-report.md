Mm.. I guess only moderators can see IPs, but I'm also guessing they were very similar if not the same from the tone of the posts.

Also probably true.
<br>
<br>
It's probably not my place to speculate, but... Mustardseed, did you log onto AP from a public computer and accidentally leave the box checked that said "always keep me logged in?" I log on from different computer labs at my university all the time, so I always have to be careful about that.
<br>
<br>
Likewise, maybe the similarity you guys are noticing is from someone who logs into AP from another computer in the aforementioned computer lab? lol
<br>
<br>
If not, oh well. Sorry for being nosy. :)

I'm glad you got this little problem sorted, you must have been a little pent up about it all.

Hi Frank
<br>
Just for my curiosity, and peace of heart, did the infamous post and the last on the thread come from the same ip number a number different from the one I normally use. I think they are generated numbers but it might  be the same.

This may or may not be pertinent but the forum script here is 2.0.11 and there are a few bugs that "could" allow for some funny business ... the authors recommend updating to 2.0.13 which is considered a "critical update".
