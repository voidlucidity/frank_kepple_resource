<section>
Hi, I'm back, missed you guys.  I feel as though I won't be able to catch up on all the discussions!  Anyway, I'm projecting again, after several weeks of botched attempts.  I am also reading Monroe's books  - - - - WOW.  In fact, I credit my renewed success to their reading . . . it just put me in the right headspace, I guess.  So much of what he says already fits with my understanding of things.
<br>
<br>
A few nights ago I got half out (my legs) but got stuck.  Oh well.  Then last night, while lying on my side (!) inbetween sleep cycles, out I went, with NO projection symptoms other than a physical pulling sensation.  I started floating away, but then remembered that Mr. Bruce suggested returning quickly to the body with the intention of REMEMBERING.  So that's what I did!  But now I'm a little confused, and need the advice of someone who's been there:
<br>
<br>
1) Why were there no projection symptoms?  Was my physical body having vibrations, etc., but I just wasn't "there" to feel them?  Or was this just a lucid dream?
<br>
<br>
2) When I returned to my body, I did not remeber any re-entry sensations.  What I did remember were snippets of DREAMS which seemed to have occurred AFTER the projection.  What's up with THAT?  Could my physical body have been dreaming while my projected double was out-and-about?  Or did my projected double sink into a dream on the way back to my body?  Or was the whole thing a dream?
<br>
<br>
AUGH!  At any rate, I'm glad to have had some conscious moments last night.  Three other things I noticed:
<br>
<br>
1)  My projected double felt very "real" - - I FELT my body pulling away, floating away (like a magic carpet).
<br>
<br>
2) my bedroom seemed distorted, almost as if I were in another very similar-but-different place, but I've read enough about visual distortions so I'm not going to dwell on it.
<br>
<br>
3) I had my usual "post-projection" symptoms - - - symptoms that only I seem to have (?).  The room shimmers when I come back to my body.  Like flickering candlelight in a dark room, or like heat rising off an airport runway on a very hot day.  I've just decided my mind is just a little out-of-phase with ordinary reality and don't worry about it.  It passes in a minute or two.
<br>

Tisha!
<br>
<br>
I loved the effect that Monroe's writings have on me and my attempts.  I It's like it sets up the right resonance in my body. Ooooh - just writing about it is getting some energy flowing.
<br>
<br>
I don't know about your questions - though I feel like we must be in close 'classes'  But I wanted to comment on your last comment -
<br>
<br>
After my first ever and very vivid projection, which was early morning, for about forty minutes my vision was not right. I saw slices of light whenever I turned my head. I felt a buzzing sensation.  Not pleasant, but not too bad either. The light show was weird.
<br>
<br>
It hasn't happened with my more dreamlike projections, so I wondered if it happens more with a more vivid projection.  Like the more consciousness you bring to the experience, the harder it is to consciously reintegrate all the way.
<br>
<br>
but I don't know!

Hi there,
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to say that all of my projections have come from sleeping on the side, have been unplanned, and have had no exit/entry symptoms.  I call them projections instead of dreams because I typically am more in control and they have no people (friends,family) in them.
<br>
<br>
I also have mixed dreams during them which I assume happened before/after the projection, but I never thought about during.  I HAVE tried to re-enter and failed since my physical body was asleep.  I actually thought I was dead for a bit.
<br>
<br>
I have a question, though...
<br>
<br>
When you and other people talk about their arms or legs separating or getting stuck, what does that feel like?
<br>
<br>
When I meditate and try the rope or sinking I occasionally get a feeling of waves of tingles descending into my legs.  They start very light and then get stronger and spread up the legs to the groin area.  The feeling is very noticeable and doesn't feel like any other sensation that I've ever felt.  It is possible that my legs are separating?  I don't always get this feeling... only around one out of every three or four attempts.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Justin

Justin,
<br>
<br>
Getting halfway out and getting stuck is very frustrating.  It doesn't feel like what you've described, which sounds more to me like energy moving around, which is a good thing, but not a projection.
<br>
<br>
It actually feels like my legs have lifted out of my body to the point where I'm almost upside down . . . the sinking and pulling-up feeling are there for me (in my legs and butt and lower back), but my neck or head are stuck.  No pain or anything, I just don't separate the way I want to.  Then the moment ends.  Augh!

Hello, Tisha, welcome back. I thought you'd like the Monroe books. Ultimate Journey is my favourite. I resonate with so much of it. My current favourite piece is from p91 beginning "At this point......" to end of chapter (p96).
<br>
<br>
You can project with no vibration symptoms.
<br>
<br>
I used to always get pre-projection vibrations. But now, I only seem to get vibrations while I am on the move, i.e. going to somewhere on the Astral, but even then not always. Recently I learnt to view the Astral from a distance and find I can "step into it" without any vibrations at all. Which I found is a *lot* more reliable than my old way of projecting.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes things can be a bit vague and, on returning to the physical, drifting off into a lucid dream is *very* possible.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, you wake up not knowing what's what. Which naturally leads you to start asking yourself, "Was this just a dream or a real obe?" But the more you learn to control the process of projection, the less this will happen: promise you.
<br>
<br>
Your projected double, as you call it, does feel very "real" to you because it *is* you.
<br>
<br>
One of the by-products of projection, is you discover the real You. The true You that, for years, has been seemingly locked in a physical body. Projection teaches you that the physical body is merely a carcass which You can connect to, and disconnect from, at will (given practice, of course).
<br>
<br>
That's why I cannot get on with the term "projected double". It give the impression that there are two of "You". That is to say, the one lying on the bed back there somewhere, and the You that is sitting on the Astral. Nope, the Physical body is not You at all. It is merely a carcass that You occupy in order to experience the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Also, if I may please point out, I feel you are going wrong in your thinking in the post where you respond to Justin saying, "Getting halfway out and getting stuck is very frustrating........"
<br>
<br>
It is difficult to tell for certain, but the feeling you describe, i.e. legs etc. out but the rest of you stuck, sounds to me like all you have done is overstimulate what Mystics call the Base Chakra. Doing so gives you a feeling exactly like you describe. But this feeling is nothing to do with Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
I think Justin is also doing something very similar. There is a Chakra around the abdomen that, when stimulated, can give you tingling sensations around the lower region of your body and a feeling of butterflies. It can also give sinking feelings, like, going over a hump-back bridge in a car.
<br>
<br>
But, again, while all these sensations can be very interesting to research (if you are into that sort of thing) none of this is Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

(antagonist, if you look up "Robert A. Monroe" on the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
website, all his books will come up.  They are worth it!  Especially the last one)
<br>
<br>
Frank, I'm always so happy to see your posts.  Thank you!  And thanks to everyone else who has responded to this post . . . these check-ins are truly worth it.  And thanks to Mr. Bruce, for providing us with the vehicle . . .

<br>
you have described much what I have experienced at times, lifting out but halting at some part, like head or legs. Thats when I push my chi out through my body to separate completely. I think your description of floating off then coming back and asking youself what was that? is common too, separating earth reality from astral reality is not always so easy, as Frank has also said.
<br>
<br>
Your description of trying to OOB but not being successful until you had dropped off is also common to me. I most often OOB after doing my meditation and falling asleep, then I leave, when I am deeply and sleepily relaxed.
<br>
<br>
Just keep doing.
