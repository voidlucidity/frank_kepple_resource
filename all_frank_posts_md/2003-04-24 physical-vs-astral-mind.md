While in the astral does the physical mind filter/receive all that is happening?  You still use your brain, and not some astral counterpart like you soul?
<br>
Well, my question is easely spelled like this: Are you dependant on your physical brain while projection(other that to keep you physical body alive)?
<br>
If so, what happens when you die physically? Will your soul/self take over all thinking and you will get rid of dangers like "The Alice In Wonderland Effect", creating own scenery etc.?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,

Hi there Truthseeker !
<br>
<br>
I'd say that there is a general consensus amongst projectors that you are not dependent on your physical brain whilst projecting. This is not backed up by physical science but is knowledge gained by projectors through direct experience.
<br>
<br>
From this viewpoint, the mind or "self" uses the brain to control the body and express itself in the physical world. After the body dies, the "soul" continues onwards - to a destination that is debated by hinduism, islam, judaism, shamanism, ....you name it.
<br>
<br>
you asked :
<br>
"While in the astral does the physical mind filter/receive all that is happening?"
<br>
<br>
The physical mind and the astral mind do not differ as such. Most of the time, a person's concious sense of awareness is in the physical world of travel, work, relationships. On the rare occasions where you find that you are conciously aware within the astral, the mind goes about its business interpreting things as it would on the physical.
<br>
<br>
This means that events \ objects that do not exist in our world, are interpreted by our physically - schooled minds.
<br>
<br>
Your last point is another good illustration of this. Our perception that we may be creating figments of our imagination is based on our experiences of living in the physical world. Within the astral, anything that you create IS your reality.
<br>
<br>
best wishes,
<br>

Touching on the point Mark has made, you have only one "mind" which basically remains the same in whatever realm of consciousness you may be. The only difference being the type of "body" it operates through.
<br>
<br>
Within the Physical, the mind interacts on this plane via a physical body made from Physical material. Within the Astral, the mind interacts via an Astral body made from Astral material, and so forth. The big difference, however, with the Physical plane, is physical-matter has a certain shelf-life. So there are natural restrictions as to how long we can remain for any one length of time.

One of the most beneficial spin-offs from being able to explore the Astral while incarnate, is you get to prepare a path for yourself following physical-body death. And the other *big* advantage is you learn how to operate with a high-level of conscious awareness within the various non-physical environments.
<br>
<br>
That way you realise beforehand all what you can do, and all that you should avoid.
<br>
<br>
Basically, upon physical-body death you should be aiming for (and ideally have already prepared yourself a place) in the higher-level Exchange territories, rather than getting yourself caught in the lower-level Belief-System territories.
<br>

Hey
<br>
<br>
I have been thinking about the mind/brain thing, and whats really going on. Have come to some sort of half-conclusion that the physical brain is the seat of the subconscious mind. So, neurologists see which areas of the brain are associated with physical movement, etc etc and give themselves a big pat on the back thinking they have solved the mind. But all these things are the modifiers of consciousness - the mind is a big computer, thats all. It lets consciousness interface with the world, shifts its focus etc.
<br>
err where was I....hmmm...
<br>
oh yes!
<br>
I find it very interesting then that the physical body is paralysed during an OBE - could it be that the sections of the brain which are used for movement are being used elsewhere? But then, its a bit confusing, because what about when you die....hmmm.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, its a thought.
<br>
<br>
Oh, as an interesting aside, I am thinking that with the process of spiritual progression, the area our consciousness operates in gets higher and higher through the dimensional scale. That is, starting as being entirely immersed in the physical and astral areas - that is, unconscious and emotional. I mean, really, its pretty obvious that most people spend most the time acting in a robot like manner, reacting and thinking in terms of emotions. eg when you say something someone dissagrees with, the initial pulse of disagreement comes before the logical thought process - the intellect is simply used as a tool to come up with the reason why they are right or wrong, to justify a preconcieved opinion. The preconception could be due to whether they like or dislike the idea (emotional), if it conflicts with their beliefs (subconscious/memory based?).
<br>
<br>
Lol, I could continue to ramble on, but I'll leave it at that!
<br>

Do you think that astral projection helps you progress spiritually, or does it just give you a glimpse into the workings behind the scenes, i.e. spiritual growth might be dependent on physical actions.
<br>
<br>
I'm inclined to think that it does help, as per Frank's post...what does everyone else think ?

clandestino,
<br>
<br>
In the humble opinion of one who is still working towards the astral proper, I would venture that it does help one progress spiritually.
<br>
<br>
Also, it would make sense that for the progress to occur, the person doing the projecting/phasing is doing so for the proper reasons, i.e. spiritual ones, or at least based on good motives.
