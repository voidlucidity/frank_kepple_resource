I heard that if you are left handed, you are (supposedly) using the right hand side of your brain more. Now, 9 out of 10 people are right handed, so that is the vast majority people. Monroe CD's balance the left and right hemispheres of your brain, so this is where I got the thought of being left handed could possibly hamper my progress to OBE.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, do you think it could affect my ability to project? (Wish me luck)
<br>
<br>
Also, when my body was completely relaxed last night trying to OBE I fell asleep and woke up a second later, and during that split-second I heard a noise, like sort of screaching, but at a low volume, and I didn't make it.

Hello Donal
<br>
<br>
I don't claim to be any kind of expert on hemisync, but this is what I have learned.
<br>
<br>
Hamsun works by sending two different frequencies of sound in each ear.  When these two combine, they act together to "hear" a third signal that effects the brain.  The range of frequencies that the sounds can be is very wide, as long as the two are different.  This would lead me to believe that it does not matter if you are right or left handed, or use a certain side of the brain more often.
<br>
<br>
If anything, being left handed might be to your advantage.  Like you said, this would mean that you use your "right brain" more often.  Many regard the right brain as being the more artistic, spiritual hemisphere; the left brain being the more analytical, logical hemisphere.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps, good luck!
<br>
<br>
Peace
<br>
Brandon

I've been a southpaw all my life. Never affected me.

Often when I meditate, it feels like my awareness is lopsided, leaning to the left. I wonder if it's because I tend to think more with the left side of my brain, and actually FEEL this when in trance.
<br>
<br>
If this is so, then since I can 'balance' myself with a bit of effort, then meditation does indeed allow you to synchronise the left &amp; right sides.
<br>
<br>
And I have noticed I tend to feel happy more often when I meditate, which could be related. . .
