Hello
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
, I just ordered the gateway expierience 1-6 and should be comming in on saturday or monday.
<br>
<br>
I was just wondering. What are the benefits of using these CDs? I have an idea, but never really talked to someone whos used them. How has it changed your life, and do you think its worth it? I'm really excited.
<br>
<br>
Thankyou

Astralwych,

<br>
I take it you're talking about TMI's Gateway Experience--Wave 1, Wave 2 and so on? I ordered them over fifteen years ago and benefited greatly--mainly in learning how to better focus my attention within and how to use the imaginative/visual powers we're all born with. I did start to get some interesting results on a number of levels but I don't think I'd be doing you a favor by introducing what I experienced. Go into it fresh, with as little outside influence as possible.
<br>
<br>
Have fun

Astralwych,
<br>
<br>
I bought the Gateway Wave 1 CD a couple of months ago.  I'm using the Focus 10 tracks in the way suggested by Frank.  All I am aiming for at the moment is to firmly establish the ability to achieve Focus 10.  I can honestly say that for me it has been money well spent.  From the very first listen they have made it so much easier for me to reach Focus 10.  Since doing the exercises I have had 3 Lucid dreams.  I had never had a lucid dream before using the Gateway exercises.  Absolutely blew me away.  The other night after doing the Focus 10 I kept falling in out of sleep.  At one point I was lying on my side feeling vibrations then shortly after I felt as if someone was clinging to my back.  I realised that I was possibly on the verge of having an OBE.  I couldn't see anything so I asked for clarity.  The next thing I am at the foot of my bed and everything is really gloomy but I can just make out a grey lump lying in my bed.  Because I couldn't see very well I tried to open my eyes.  I then woke up.  It could have been a dream because I know it wasn't a conscious exit.  The only reason I think it may have been an actual OBE is because I remember reading in Robert Monroe's 'Journeys out of the Body' that he once experienced a feeling of someone clinging to his back which worried him until he realised it was the real copy of himself as he was separating into his etheric body or something like that.
<br>
<br>
Anyway,  I've only really started on the Gateway exercises.  The great thing about this forum is that there is heaps of info about the Gateway stuff if you search for it.  However, I agree with Ginny  it's probably best to go into it fresh.
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
There's a post in the Sticky section I wrote a couple of years ago on my use of the Wave-1 CD. I've moved away from the Monroe model the past year as I began hitting certain limitations with it, so I developed my own. But the Monroe linear-focus model is still very valid and should take you a long way. I wish you every success in the use of the CDs.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
