Interesting read. They are Demonic Extraterrestrials. They may be the cause with the Shadow Government of the New World Order.
<br>
<br>
This has to do with Native Elders speaking about these creatures.
<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with David Ickle but he has questioned some Natives for some of his books that I do not say is the truth about them. I can not change your skepticism nor your belief system.
<br>
<br>
ONCE AGAIN - This thread has nothing to do with David Ickle but about the Native Elders speaking about the creatures.
<br>
<br>
Yes, I do believe about these creatures, it makes little sense about our earths society.

Hmm, we need a new section... Astral Ridiculousness.
<br>
<br>
How is it the purveyors of this tosh always tend to claim they are challenging OUR belief systems? More like it's their own sense of sanity is being challenged, lol.

To be honest, now you come to mention it, I think it needs it's own little world, lol.
<br>
<br>
On a serious note, the core problem (as we have discussed before) is everyone always
<i>
 objectifies
</i>
everything. They don't see it as an objective
<i>
 interpretation
</i>
of the underlying subjective reality.
<br>
<br>
So when I read stuff like this, most of the time I can understand exactly where they are coming from. So I'm not totally dismissing it out of hand like some people have mistakenly believed. I can almost feel sorry for this David Icke bloke. And I don't mean that in a patronising way. But they just can't get it! It's like there is a missing link in the interpretation of the subjective events. I guess they don't see them as subjective events... because they only see the objective.
<br>
<br>
I said to you a while ago, that probably the biggest inner challenge people are faced with is objectively viewing subjective reality. It is the trickiest thing in the world, physical or non-physical world that is. And in the past, I have made just about every mistake there is to make, so I can't blame these people.
<br>
<br>
There is a big question of realisation that comes into it. If they would only look at their
<u>
 own
</u>
notices about challenging belief constructs and apply them to themselves... they would do rather well. But those notices only apply to "others" of course. Because they view themselves as having "made it". They haven't made it at all. They just became a one-eye in the land of the blind.
<br>
<br>
They still have their other eye to find yet, lol.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

IÂ´ve commented somewhere that in these days people talk to much about the end of the world, conspiracy theories, etc,etc in a very apocaliptical way.
<br>
<br>
We need to be more careful or people will disbelief some of that phenomenons if they are real and deserve attention.
<br>
<br>
For example, ufos. There are ufos. I dont know what they are. Maybe USA crafts, a natural thing or aliens indeed, but people ridicularize these things and eventually scientists will not study it because all they will see its crazy people saying crazy things about a strange phenomenon.

There are beings of negative polarity...But the term demonic would suggest that they ARE terrestrial. But I'm sure this is obvious to most. And David Icke is quite mad.
