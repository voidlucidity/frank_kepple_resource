   Hello, i've just joined this forum about 2 weeks ago.  This forum is so huge it'll take some time to know just where to post...hope i didn't post in the wrong place.  i've been having some kind of lucid or out of body experiences but i haven't gotten to the part in the book that explains it.  From reading your FAQ's i see i shouldn't have gotten as frightened when i heard the "astral noises or voices" nor the shadows walking around in my room.  Although there seemed to be a being who stayed with me throughout this entire experience and she seemed to be caring or looking after me...Well not to bore people because it looks like you're all so advanced and i'm just starting out.
   <br>
   Love and harmony,
   <br>

Leannain, you really must work on being waaaay too friendly, some people find it offensive.
<br>
<br>
On that note, welcome to the forums inharmony.

I can understand you wanting to look around first, it can be a bit overwhelming.  It sounds like you've already had some interesting experiences, look forward to hearing more.
<br>
<br>
Take Care,
<br>

Hehehe..you make it too easy..why do you do that?
<br>
<br>
I Hate to go the ole` tiresome senerio about the parent thing..but.....please tell me why you do what you do?
<br>
<br>
Why do you think it is easier to think that you aren't funny, or for that matter, whatever you think, it isn't worthy of our time?
<br>
<br>
I'm putting my money on the fact that you are funny.  I'm also putting my money on that somebody, or someone, told you that you weren't worthy of those laughs.  Hummphhhfft...they were wrong.
