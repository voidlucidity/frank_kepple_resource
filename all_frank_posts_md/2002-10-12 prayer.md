Whats up.......I was wondering what you all think of prayer.  To me.....as I think about it....prayer is VERY useless.  I've prayed for so many things in my life.....more love...more friends....etc etc....I used to get panic attacks and I prayed for that to be gone.  But none of it has worked!   I guess you can make the point that God is inside us....if you believe that and you shouldn't have to ask for anything....because God is in you etc etc.....but to me that doesn't make sense either.  Because I don't have alot of friends and I've prayed for more friends...but nada zilch zero.   So what do you all  think?  Have any of you used prayer effectively in achieving you desires and goals?
<br>
<br>
If you have what specifically did you do right that I'm doing wrong?
<br>
<br>
Thanks All.

Prayer is not easy for me because I do not believe in God. If you start with no one to pray to it makes less sense to pray. Then someone explained to me that prayer could be considered like a mantra meditation, and that the words are supposed to sink in and affect the thinking habits of daily life. As to praying for specific things, that it is best to pray for things for other people. Attachment to results is just as harmful with prayer as it is with meditation. The "silva mind control esp" system or something like that has a good method. They claim to be able to get results, although they also say it is easier to get results for other people because there is less attachment to results. They then add that when you pray for other people without consideration for your own wants and needs you are more likely to get the things you want and need anyway.

<section>
Prayer is simply energy manipulation in a pointed direction..  You actually don't have to believe in God to pray..[sorry Tom] The defination of prayer I feel is misunderstood.  I love your thought on this however Tom..  They are very important ones.
<br>
<br>
But now, I want to address Arie..  Arie, the key to you as I see it...is for you to start feeling good about yourself.  People cannot do that for you.  God/energy
<b>
 is
</b>
inside of all of us..  Develop that quality of spirit and people will come to you..  But be calm and serene in your efforts and be genuine with the right reasons and your life will get better...  Prayer or energy work, as I see it, should not be used as a means of personal gain to reach our desires and physical goals.  Prayer or energy work should be a means to reach our spiritual goals..  which in turn, will help direct us in other areas of our lives.  But motive is a main ingredient concerning anything spiritual and should be evaluated by all..
<br>
<br>
Be calm, be good and most important...learn to love yourself...
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Blossom

Tom and Blossom thanks for the input. I greatly appreciate it.  Lately I've been evaluating all my beliefs and I'm beginning to doubt more and more.  Lately I've had the belief that God is Love.  Because I have experienced love.  But then again how is that God is the emotion of love.  That doesn't make sense.  How can he be an emotion.  He has to be much more than that.  Tom I'm interested in your belief that God doesn't exist.  How did you come to that conclusion?  Do you believe that we are eternal.  Because my intuition is telling me that we are.  It doesn't make sense that anyone can "lose" existence or become extinct.  Lately I've been "sensing" my intuition more powerfully.  I describe it as a calm inner knowing.  Do you guys know what I mean?  I feel alot more empowered and somehow I sense that I'm on the right track.  I haven't felt like this ever.   I'm also starting to go turn away from western religion to the east.  I am interested in enlightenment.  Can you guys tell me what this is exactly?  Is it a state of mind or what?  Or is it a calm inner knowing magnified by 100.  I have no clue.  I would love all your input!
<br>
<br>
Blossom I think that is so important to begin to love yourself and be true to yourself.
<br>
<br>
Thanks Tom and Blossom

It is true that I don't believe in God. That is why prayer is not easy for me. I still make attempts to do it, though, and find satisfaction from making the effort.

And in the other breath you say your prayers are not being answered???
<br>
<br>
Sounds like topsy-turvy thinking to me, which I believe is quite probably the source of your anxiety.

Hi Arie,
<br>
<br>
Blossoms answer, though a very analytical statement or observation, is essentially correct. Combine her thoughts with the idea that it is also simply a request put forward to higher spiritual beings.
<br>
<br>
I find it ironic that the one prayer that was very quickly and very definitely answered for me was when I left behind my christian beliefs to expand my spiritual knowledge. I had broken down my belief system to the most basic elements that fit with my experiences. I was empty, with no real direction. While meditating one day I put out a prayer, not to God, but to the higher spirits (angels actually) to give me direction for my beliefs. I was answered almost instantly.
<br>
<br>
Prayer does work. But in order for it to work you must first, pray from the heart, in ernest and be direct and specific, not half hearted or vague, and as Blossom mentioned, not for material reasons. Intent is the key here. Second, believe in those spirit beings that you are praying to. I prayed to angels because I have personally experienced their presence. I believe that they exist.
<br>
<br>
Tom, this might give you a useful perspective also. God need not be involved with prayer at all. Your belief in the spirit world is all that is needed to put forward a request, a "prayer".
<br>
<br>
Arie, if you are feeling somewhat confused with your beliefs I would highly recommend looking at an article by Robert Bruce in the main Astral Pulse site called "The Catch Basket Concept." Also if your intuition is guiding you somewhere, go with it. I'm a great believer in intuition, and have learned over the years to never second guess it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
James.

A few years ago I went through a period of having suicidal thoughts for no real reason. Naturally this affected my dearly in all aspects. I would get up out of bed, see the sun, and curse it. This went on for about a month and no matter how much I tried to fight it, suicide kept coming up as a way out. Needless to say I was desperate.
<br>
<br>
I had a pair of rosary beads in my room that I hadn't picked up since my confirmation and one day I decided to actually go through to entire rosary. It took a little while but afterwards I felt alittle better and the next day I was fine.
<br>
<br>
During the prayer, I never really held out and wish or desire to God, I just prayed and those prayers were answered. Even today when I pray or meditate(yes catholics, and in general most christians meditate) I try not to ask God for anything.
<br>
<br>
I hadn't prayed the rosary before or after that time but lately i've been having the urge again(for no reason other than doing it).
<br>
<br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring;
<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken:
<br>
The crownless again shall be king.

Hello,
<br>
Please do not misunderstand nor be offended, but Arie's post brought to mind the joke about the man who turned away rescuers saying "God will save me" when trapped on the roof of his house in a flood. Of course he died and when he got to heaven asked God why he didn't save him. He was told by God that various rescuers had been sent to save him and he had turned them all away.
<br>
Is it possible that your prayers have been answered and certain people have come into your life and you simply did not recognize them for who or what they were?
<br>
Also, I am sorry but "give me, give me" makes you sound like a spoiled child demanding things from their parents. To me prayer is to bring about change in your life no matter what you believe in and whether or not you believe in God. We also, whether or not you believe in God, have free will, right? That means taking responsibilty, not only for your actions, but for your life. Try giving thanks for something already happening.....and I agree with James S. that heartfelt emotion is neccessary.
<br>
Try this on for size........
<br>
To (Creator/God/Supreme Being/Cosmic Energy/Spirits and Forces of Nature [or use them all so you don't have to worry about getting the right one

<br>
I thank you for allowing/helping me to find the strength and courage within myself to bring about the changes neccessary for more love and friendship to flow into my life so that all our lives will be enriched by our sharing for our good and gaining to make us all  better people. I thank you, it is done, so mote it be.
<br>
Too long winded? This is simply an idea....create your own. I have found after 20 years experience that this type of prayer, said often with true heartfelt emotion, always works. But you have to take an active part in making the change happen and please don't expect it overnight; give a few weeks or even a few months and it will happen.
<br>
Anyway, I hope maybe this will help you a little.
<br>
<br>
Brightest Blessings

My experience of prayer is very specific and very directive.I only pray something when something is out of my control or soemthing I impulsely involved or other things. I pray towards my higher-self and it seems to be a VERY powerful entity. I recalled that I being impulsively pursuaded by my friend to invested in a stock market. I invested almost 80% of my money available. Then the next thing, the prices dwindles down and down. It was a hellish experience. And I know how the feeling of HELL is like and I strongly dislike and I prefer PEACE of mind. I meditated and concentrated for assistance for my higher-self to give me a strong hint for me to sell so that I will lose as little as possible. I specifically asked for induction of stomache. Yes, a few days later, I had a strange stomache, I quickly sold it. And yes, I sold at the best price. At that time, while I was praying I CHALLEGED the existence of HIGHER-SELF and it showed its POWER. This is one occasion of private assistance by my higher-self. There are several assistance too. Not all occasion that u get him from higher-self,u know when no help is given when you are being scoulded by higher-self. Anyway, I LOVE my higher-self for it shows me the true meaning of LOVE.
<br>
I pray
<br>
God, you create this universe,
<br>
God, you shower us with love,
<br>
In the hope that we choose to love God,
<br>
In the hope that we choose to appreciate our existence.

Most prayers that are "answered" are answered by the person praying with psychic power. Prayers usually dont work because people dont know who they're praying to, themselves.
