 Hi I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this question but here goes...
 <br>
 <br>
 Around the site the word neg keeps coming up but I don't know what this is. Could anyone please fill me in on this.
 <br>
 <br>
 Thanks a lot for any replys.[

A "neg" is a negative spirit of some kind. On the astral, you may be bothered by "negs" if you are in the lower levels...the jury is out on whether they can harm you or not; they can definitely scare you though.
<br>
<br>
In fact, the jury is out on whether or not "negs" are not merely created by your own mind within the astral planes. There, thought = action, so if you are worried about encountering, say, a scary pack of dogs, then there's a good chance you will.

 Wow, they really don't sound very nice things to encounter. I will have to watch out for them thanks.

Within the Physical realm people tend to get polarised by constructs such as positive and negative. Something which gives satisfaction and gratification is assumed positive and something which brings the opposite is classed as negative: hence the term "neg". Within the Astral, however, no such notions apply. Though people often continue thinking in the same way as they would do while Physical.
<br>
<br>
Within non-physical realms, what is within ourselves tends to manifest outside ourselves. When people perceive these manifestations it is only natural for them to feel they are being "attacked". Because their thinking follows along very much the same lines as it would do if the same event came about within the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, the lower Astral levels are populated with all manner of human crud. Every degree of human wickedness is represented many, many times over. But these people have no power whatsoever as, fortunately, their behaviour locks them in an Astral no man's land. The only harm these hapless individuals can cause is when some aspect of their personality resonates with an aspect of someone who is projecting.
<br>
<br>
For example, someone fluent in a language I had absolutely no knowledge of could swear at me in the most disgusting terms that language could offer. They could hit me with insult after insult, yet none of what that person was conveying would mean a darned thing to me. Reason being, nothing about the sounds the person was making would resonate with any similar sound-release-meaning within myself.
<br>
<br>
Plus, it is a fact that people who project and have problems with these so-called negative entities are actually being presented with an opportunity for inner growth. But I guess not all that many see it that way.

Although the only real battle is that happening within oursleves...I do believe in real opposition in the universe/reality.  Part of the reaons for living in this world/lower level, is to learn and see the difference between good/evil, darkness/light...and then rise above those and control them.  But I do believe we must become the light, or the dark...and not both at the same time.  It is all about polarization, although aren't we made from that which is neither?
<br>
<br>
Does that make sense to anyone but me (I think that explanation is horrible).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I believe in negs but the only way were can be affected is if we allow it to happen, either consciously or sub-consciously.

unless im mistaken, obviously, negative things
<i>
 can
</i>
do physical harm to you. robert bruce, in astral dynamics, said that when he was experimenting with negative beings, his projections were becoming very weak and he was constantly lacking energy. someone had put some kind of spell or curse on him.
<br>
<br>
then there are all the reports of vampire-like things that 'feed' on energy.
<br>
<br>
so they can at least do some types of damage relating to the physical, depleting people of energy.

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
This made me think of a re-occuring dream I use to have when younger.
<br>
Well, I call it a dream but I think it was much more now.
<br>
<br>
It would always start with me sitting on a low stone wall, facing a dirt road, that ran parallel to the wall.  If you looked to the right you could see a few yards down the road then darkness, look left, same thing.  I would look behind me and YIKES.. Cemetary! Even had a scary Mosseleum (sp?) Anyway, I would, for stupid reasons unknown, start walking amoung the graves...Welp, then the night of living dead would come out of the woods and start coming after me....
<br>
They would chase and chase, I would hide and hide and it ended the same way every time, them getting within feet of me, and me waking up scared to death!
<br>
Geez...I must have had that damn dream 6-7 times (trust me, that was PLENTY)
<br>
<b>
 UNTIL
</b>
....There I am again, looking at that dirt road.  I swear I laughed out loud... I couldn't believe I was back in this dream that made me scared sh**less.  I turned around..yep..sure enough Cemetary..[
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
]  I knew the dead people were on their way...but cha know what I did?...YEP! I jumped right off that wall and walked down the dirt road and never looked back!  I have NEVER had that dream again.[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]  I remember in the dream I was just FED UP!
<br>
Fed up of feeling awful for HOURS after waking.
<br>
<br>
I guess I faced my fears that day!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for listen!

<br>
Nay: Yes, I can relate to this only too well.
<br>
<br>
That's basically what happened to me in the beginning. I would project to the Astral and I'd
<u>
 repeatedly
</u>
find myself in all manner of dumb situations where I'd be fighting this and running away from that. One day, while within a projection, I just thought sod-it!
<br>
<br>
I was fighting alongside others in this world-war-one style trench. The enemy were charging at us and no amount of shooting would stop them. I was about to get stabbed by a bayonet. A part of me knew I had reached this kind of point before, ever so many times; a point in the projection where it all went completely out of control and something particularly nasty was about to happen to me; but the moment before it did I'd be zapped back to Physical.
<br>
<br>
This particular morning, for some reason, I just thought sod-it! Stab me or shoot me if you want! I truly don't care anymore! I'm completely sick and tired of having these experiences! And I simply walked away.
<br>
<br>
To my utter amazement, that whole gruesome scene just vanished and I found myself walking beside lake. The sky was blue and the sun was shining. Somewhere, someone was playing the most romantic classical music I ever heard.
<br>
<br>
For a moment I was confused. Then the realisation dawned: all those years I'd been fighting my own fears, and the pattern became ever so clear. The way it would start with something small; then I'd think something bad was about to happen; then it did; and I'd expect it to get worse; then it did; etc., etc.; to the point where I couldn't take it any more and I'd have to retreat back to Physical double-quick.
<br>
<br>
That morning I realised, within the Astral, Thought equals Direct Action; thoughts become things; thoughts fuel events; emotions come to life. Since then I never looked back. It was a major turning point for me.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
