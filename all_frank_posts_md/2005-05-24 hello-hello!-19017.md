Hello all. My nick is AlisClan. I say that because my name is Alice and I Have a small clan of kids running at my feet. LOL!
<br>
<br>
Iv worked on Astral travel sense I was 12 years old. I didn't have much success until the last year or so. Once I got out, I went to my kitchen sink
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
. Yeah, of all the places I
<i>
 could have
</i>
went, and I ended up at the sink.
<br>
<br>
Iv been out a few times, and I'm working on doing so some more. I also find using the brainwave generator kinda helps sometimes too. My favorite one to use is called "Astral Travel without fail".
<br>
<br>
Well that's all for now!

Hello Alice
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the Forums.
<br>
<br>
During my first OBE I planned to go to the Grand Canyon.  I got as far as my back door!  Sounds just as exciting as yours...

Hope you'll be sharing your experiences with us soon!

Hi Alice! So you have children running at your feet? lol! Do you work with childs or these ones are your sons?
<br>
<br>
I work with childrens too. 10-12 years sometimes less years (or more).
<br>
<br>
IReally love when they have 6-7 years. Last year my work was with children at that age...very funny!.

LOL..sounds like me with my kids running around.  Stay home mom?  Of course you would go to the sink, isn't that were you spend alot of time during the day, doing dishes and washing up stuff?  Makes sense to me that it would be upfront in your mind.

It sure is nice to have another mom on the forums, now we can swap horror stories about our kids..
