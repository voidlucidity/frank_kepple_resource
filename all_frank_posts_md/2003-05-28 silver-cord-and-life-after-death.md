<section>
According to Mr.Bruce your soul or projection will separate from your body after death and will remain in the real time zone for several days untill etheric matter will run out, then it will proceed to other planes on it's way to heaven/hell.
<br>
<br>
It is clear that the more energy your chakras pumping in your projection, the more conscious you are.
<br>
<br>
While projecting, this energy is supplied via "silver cord" yes? no? After death this energy flow stops yes? no? Accodring to the energy theory consciousnes should also die off. Is there or is there not some sort of claim that could support Mr.Bruces' theory?

<section>
when you die, the silver cord is severed and energy flow from your body stops. your energy starts waning out several days before you die, as your body knows when your time is about up. hence the change in aura for people that are about to die.
<br>
<br>
as far as your level of consciousness, i wouldnt know anything about that. you'd have to ask robert bruce. i suppose to find something like that out youd have to project and find recently deceased people on the planes.

<br>
That´s not true. Your consciousness will be transmitted to etheric or astral body.
<br>
There is one technique for astral projection.
<br>
You create(with imagination) double of your body(imaginationary body is astral body) and then you transfer your consciousness from physical body to astral double.

<section>
First of all, there is no such thing as a "double" it's all you, the same you, here and there, there is no locality to your mind or your "double". It has no locality, it's non local, no bilologicla quantum consiosness. Study quantum physics.
<br>
<br>
After death you "trasnfer" from your body to astral, from astral to etheric bla bla. that is all words, no offence but it's imply assumptions, not even theories. Even Robert Bruce hasn't got all the ins and the outs on this matter.
<br>
<br>
It's not only more complex than we think, it might be more complex than we can think.
<br>
<br>
<br>
STILL my question. Energy goes via chakras into pinea gland where YOU can separate and project. Body dies, energy dies, logically it would be a good bet to assume your soul dies too since there is no energy.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, i have to go sorry for spelling more on this tomorow.
<br>
When replying try to base your answer from a scientific perspective and not just mere assumtions and guesses.

<section>
I disagree about the soul and the ethereal (etheric) body dying afer physical death. There is plenty of energy to be found everywhere. Chi, ki, prana, kundalini, whatever. It is EVERYWHERE. You don't even have to look for it. Ectoplasm and bioplasm too. And other energies most people don't even know exist.

<br>
Thats true that soul dies after there is no energy,but your spirit doesn. Your spirit is part of the highest level of existance, and he doesnt need body.
<br>
Your spirit when you reincarnate,gets new body and gets new etheric and astral body---soul.

<br>
<br>
<br>
I always say that those who think once they die that's it, nothing more, are in for a mighty big surprise.
<br>
<br>
The act of conscious projection is very similar to the act of physical-body death. The latter holding the advantage as there's no getting snapped back to Physical just as things start getting interesting.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
One of the major lessons a person learns from being able to explore non-physical realms, which also gives them a mega-advantage, is how the Physical realm is an end result. Not, as people in the main assume a start point.
<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as "death" as far as consciousness is concerned, and no energy can run-out. (Even basic Physics tells us energy can neither be created nor destroyed.) All that happens is a person changes their energetic form and begins living within an environment pertaining to that form.
<br>
<br>
The process is really quite straightforward. Unfortunately, thousands of years of mystical-release-religious teaching and/or conditioning has shrouded what is the very basic, simple and natural process of physical-body death.
<br>
<br>
There is no rule, for instance, that says a person goes either to heaven or to hell after x-number of days. If only non-physical life were so cut and dried! Though by that I'm not implying it is all more complex than we can think (as touched on by the original poster). My experience of non-physical realms has taught me that it is more a question of it all being a lot more simple and a lot more straightforward than we can currently think it to be.
<br>
<br>
Once the physical body dies a person simply continues living through a body of a type which pertains to the non-physical region they happen to be resident within. The environment provides all the necessary "energy" for their body to function just as the Physical environment provides for us while we are Physical. The way in which the respective environments provide this sustenance is different. But similar principles apply.
<br>
<br>
Someone who has learnt to consciously project within non-physical realms, has a major advantage due to them being familiar with the process; their consciousness has learnt how to operate confidently and comfortably within non-physical realms; thus giving them
<u>
 far wider
</u>
degrees of freedom.
<br>
<br>
A person, whose consciousness has not fully learnt how to operate within non-physical realms, will have varying degrees of difficulty depending on their level of development. While this situation is steadily changing, the majority of people either need (or continue to feel the need) to become incarnate once again.
<br>
<br>
People who miss the point by too large a margin, can end up within a heaven or a hell of their choosing: which is one end of the scale; the other being the growing numbers of people who have graduated from Earth-life University who now live on the "next level" so to speak, in preparation for further graduations to successive levels.

<section>
Still, there is no logical explanation for the silver cord.
<br>
<br>
Silver cord suggests that some form of energy is transfered between between your living body and your projection, i.e. physical body *generates* energy support for the projection.
<br>
<br>
Imagine you are projecting and all of a sudden silver cord gets *cut off*, are you saing that projection will somehow jump to an alternative source of energy?
<br>
<br>
I will do another post tonight concerning something very interesting in regard to this subject.

One might say i don't have proof that we die.
<br>
<br>
I say show me proof that we stay alife.
<br>
<br>
I will not blieve in the "afterlife" gyberish untill i see my long departed father.
<br>
<br>
Even then i will not belive in it. I will still doubt, how do i know it is my father, for all i know it could be my subconisoness regenerating him from memory or it could be anyone or anything pretending to be him and scaning my mind for my expected fathers behaviour.
<br>
<br>
There is another cause for concern. In ancient times, wise humans known certain arts for achiving spiritual immortality. If we live aftre death why would they go through all the trouble of achiving it?
<br>
Ohh i know what some will say "because they were blinded by evil forces" yeah, right or "they were foolish and wer are smart" yeah, right.

<section>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I always thought the notion of a "silver cord" an interesting concept. I suppose it stems from the more traditional, mystical view of projecting in some way outside the Physical body. In the sense of leaving it behind.
<br>
<br>
Such a notion naturally brought forth all kinds of other ideas too. The idea that your physical body could be "possessed" by some "spirit" while you were "out" is just one example of many.
<br>
<br>
I've been fortunate in that I have experienced hundreds and hundreds of projections. Never once have I come across a "cord" (silver or otherwise). Maybe I'm just cord-blind or something, who knows. Even if there were some kind of mystical piece of string connecting me with my physical body while I was projecting, this would be more for my physical body's benefit more than anything.
<br>
<br>
Like I made clear in my previous post (and in several other posts to this BBS) the Physical realm is an end result, not a start point.
<br>
<br>
I think the notion of an "afterlife" is gibberish too. So on that point we concur. Though perhaps for different reasons. A person has only one life which is an infinite cycle. Hence there can be no "before" or "after". These are just physical-realm constructs.
<br>
<br>
By the same token there is no "life after death". We are all as dead now as we will ever be. Which is not my phrase but, when I read it, I thought how flaming true is that.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

What then reincarnate? Astral(etheric) body or just only spirit.
<br>
Choice that spirit reincarnate can lead us to answer why we dont remember our past lives. All our memories we transfer to Akhastic record and very little is left to our spirit.
<br>
For existance in Mental or Spirit world we dont need body, and some people say that after we die(after etheric and astral phase) we go to mental world---then we lost our etheric or astral body---we could call that the second death.
<br>
<br>
I am even not sure what is the truth: Does reincarnate etheric (or astral body) or just only spirit.
<br>
Jogys (I dont know how to spell yoga--people who take up with yoga )
<br>
say that only spirit reincarnate

<section>
Two more paradoxes i can think of
<br>
<br>
1. After death, is it we move on to other realms (heaven hell whatever) or reincarnate? If there is no beginning nor end to us, why is it i can only remember myself from the moment i was born? Normally i can only remember events that took place after i was 10 years and older but under certain conditions i can access memories from 5 month, 2 years, 5 years. why is it there is nothing before that?
<br>
this whole reincarnation/heaven misconceptions sounds so confusing and ridiculous that i cant even begin to understand those who came up with it and get away pretending to believe it.
<br>
<br>
2. living energy never dies agreed. But what about consciousness? What if after death is like one never ending dream and if you can't master lucid dreaming in life you won't be even aware of yourself.
<br>
What happens to animals when they die? Do they go to heaven or reincarnate like we do yes? no?     NO?  But what about us? We ARE animals, we have 98% similarity of our genes to that of chimpanzee. The only thing separating many people is that they learned how to talk, shave and play with tools.
<br>
<br>
Some people have developed higher consciousness in our brains, this brain circuits are physical and will die, i.e. stop functioning the moment life support stops. The only way i can think of which would allow higher consciousness to stay with us if our energy - our soul, had some sort of non biological imprint from it.
<br>
<br>
And just think about other forms of death, violent death. Someone shoots you with a gun. It takes great deal of focus and optimal health condition to reach non physical state, how do you think it will be possible when half of your head is missing?

<section>
Your spirit doesnt need body , he is eternal , he can live in or without the body, he is the essence of consciousness, he is the higher self.
<br>
Your personality,astral(etheric),and mental body is part of lower self.
<br>
There is no difference between the people when we look the higher self, there is only difference according to lower self, according to higher self we are all brothers and te same.
<br>
All higher selfs of all living creatures, things, even of unliving nature, makes God.
<br>
God is general impersonality, and everithing has the glimpse of God in it.
<br>
We, people we are at the highest level of living creatures in material world, and the higher self , or the glimpse of God is the strongest in people, we are  of the top of all living beings to overcome material world and to stop the cirlce of reincarnation.

Very ... vague explanation.
<br>
<br>
I have a quote for you
<br>
"If smoking isn't allowed in Heaven, i'm not coming"
<br>
<br>
Guess who said that WITHOUT google[8D]
<br>
<br>
Same for me, if i loose my intelectual capacity or / i.e become unconscious in heaven, i'm not going.
<br>
<br>
Better yet i have a whole potential list of creatures who i don't want to be with in the same heaven.
<br>
<br>
More over if i don't get what's in my signature, any kind of heaven will be deemed by me as useless no matter how good it makes me feel.
<br>
<br>
I already come to some sorf of acceptance that i'm never going to get it. There are two things i can do about it...
<br>
Redempt those responsible for it
<br>
or
<br>
Settle down for the second best

It surely is a pitty, in terms of defining by consensus what is real, that the non-physical dimension can be so diferent for each of us.
<br>
For example, eventhough I have by now only experienced "douzens and douzens" of projections, I have managed to see the silver cord in two occasions. At both times I saw it right after exit in the RT-zone when I was intentionally looking for the cord, and to make sure it was not just a creation of my thought I grabed it to feel an energetic string.

Tyler,
<br>
<br>
Consciousness is more than energy... [^]
<br>
<br>
If you want to read more on the subject of the after-life process, I sincerely recommend the book Projectiology (
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.iacworld.org/English/Publications/Projectiology.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.iacworld.org/English/Publications/Projectiology.asp
</a>
)
<br>
since it explains the whole process in an very consistent and logical manner.
<br>
If you don´t want to buy it, I believe it is possibel to consult the book in the IAC´s London office.
<br>

There is no death.
<u>
 You are as dead now as you will ever be
</u>
. The place you will find yourself living at, when you shed your current physical body, is down to you; as it is largely determined by your current level of development. If I may be so bold as to fly in the face of centuries of religious and/or mystical conditioning; a person's level of development has little to do with a person's level of belief in some kind of deity.
<br>
<br>
What happens with people generally is there's an initial period of confusion once they shed their physical body. The degree of confusion is more or less proportional to the extent to which they believed physical-body death was the end of their existence.
<br>
<br>
The ideal situation is for a person to have already familiarised themselves with the various non-physical realms beforehand. For these people, physical-body death holds no fears, no anxiety, and no confusion. More often than not, they experience a seamless transition from one realm to the next. The place they head for, with be a place familiar to them as they will have prepared this path well in advance. As such, these people have maximum freedom of movement coupled with a wide range of lifestyle choices.
<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, here is where having mild religious beliefs can give a person an advantage.
<br>
<br>
People who believe in the concept of an "afterlife" in a sort-of mainstream sense will let go of their physical body with far less anxiety and fear. This helps them tremendously. Plus, they are at least expectant of something else to come. So the confusion factor is very much reduced.
<br>
<br>
However, people who are deeply religious can run into difficulty (though they might not see it that way for quite some time) as they often get caught in the lower regions, where there exists all manner of "heavens" and "hells". Within these regions a person's freedom of movement and lifestyle choices are restricted by the rules, regulations, laws, and so forth, of the prevailing regime.
<br>
<br>
The worst cases are generally where a person steadfastly believes that once the physical body dies that is it. They firmly believe there is no afterlife of any description, and this physical reality is all that exists.
<br>
<br>
These people tend to suffer the most confusion following physical-body death. Many of them can be seen just wandering around aimlessly trying to work out what happened to them. Some get together in groups to pool ideas and, after a while, begin to make some kind of sense of it all. Some eventually work it out for themselves. Others are rescued by guides and the like. People caught within the bounds of this predicament, have little freedom of movement and no real lifestyle choices.

This is a natural condition which most of us experience. The problem is you are attempting to sense non-physical reality information with your physical senses: which doesn't work. In a way it's like trying to measure electrical voltage with a tape measure. It can't be done. You have to use a sensing device appropriate to the matter in question. Likewise, in order to be able to sense non-physical reality experiences, you need to attune your non-physical reality senses. This is basically what Astral projection is all about.

This is a common problem. There are significant numbers of people who believe that death is like going to sleep and never waking up; quite a number of whom do, in fact, end up getting caught in a kind of never-ending dream. People from the Moen School, for example, specialise in rescuing people trapped in these kinds of circumstances.

Advanced incarnates, chances are, will have been "animals" at some stage or other. I'm no expert on this as I specialise more in the human-consciousness side of things. But I do know there are multiple orders of consciousness. Human consciousness is, therefore, just one of quite a number. I don't know how many there are exactly (I suspect it's a lot). And each order of consciousness undergoes whatever life-cycle pertains to each respective order.

People have confused the functioning of the mind and brain for centuries. Basically, the brain runs the physical body and that's basically it. In a nutshell, the physical body is simply a vehicle which allows the mind to operate within and, therefore, experience this Physical realm directly: as opposed to being some kind of onlooker.

  And just think about other forms of death, violent death. Someone shoots you with a gun. It takes great deal of focus and optimal health condition to reach non physical state, how do you think it will be possible when half of your head is missing?

<br>
When the physical-body dies, the mind retracts. Often the mind understands what is happening and swiftly reacts to the physical-body, death event. There are times when things don't quite happen to plan as, after all, we do enjoy an element of free will. Which is why people from the Moen-school, and such like, can have rather a busy time of things during natural disasters for instance.

<section>
Thanks for sound explanatios Frank.
<br>
<br>
A few more questions.
<br>
"Likewise, in order to be able to sense non-physical reality experiences, you need to attune your non-physical reality senses. This is basically what Astral projection is all about.
<br>
"
<br>
Is it possible to access data bank on who or what i was before my physical human life?
<br>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
People from the Moen School, for example, specialise in rescuing people trapped in these kinds of circumstances.
<br>
"
<br>
So there is a solid chance i might loose my higher consiosness (AND i heard meomory too) if i die? And it will be up to a chance or luck whether i regain it ot not.
<br>
<br>
Usually when i have normal dreams i.e. non projection ones, i find my subconsiosness in a giant mess, things and thoughts come up at absolute random and even if i do become lucid for a brief moment i can't help but say "bonk it" and just ignore what ever my subconsiosness is up to.
<br>
If that's the state i'm going to find myself if i die .... NO THANK YOU [

But i guess it wont be the case since when i actually have a dream where i'm projecting things get better.

No, the chances of that happening are extremely remote. Most people get rescued by relatives, friends, guides and so forth. People There are very helpful and many work ever so hard to help those having difficulties making the transition.

The latter is a good sign.
<br>
<br>
Although I can project with a fairly high degree of proficiency I still do dream. Sometimes I find myself dreaming all manner of abstract nonsense. However, once my sense of conscious awareness comes into play, all the abstract stuff dissipates more or less right away.
<br>
<br>
The people who have the difficulties tend to be those who, when their sense of conscious awareness comes into play the situation gets
<u>
 worse
</u>
. You'll find a number of examples of people who have this kind of experience on the psychic self-defence forum.
<br>
<br>
I did take a look at your post about human sacrifices but it's not really my thing, sorry.

Tyler has some interesting questions
<br>
<br>
Concerning the silver cord.  I don't know if it is silver or not, but it is there.  While you are astral projecting and are in your spiritual body, reach behind your head on your spiritual body, and you will fill a protrusion and somewhat thick cord coming out of the back of the head of your spiritual body.
<br>
It only makes sense, if there is nothing whatsoever connecting you to your physical body, then you should be in the spiritual realm permanently.  Only when the attachment between the physical body and spiritual body is broken, does the spirit leave the physical body and enter into the spiritual realm for it's next transition.
<br>
The question I have is this.  Can any entities besides God and the Holy Angels sever your silver cord why you are astral projecting.  If they can what devices in the spiritual realm would they use to do this, or what technique would they use to do this.  If anyone has ever died while astral projecting by having the cord severed, it's for sure they were not able to come back to tell us about it or warn us about certain entities.
<br>
I do not believe that God or the Holy Angels would sever the cord of a human being that is astral projecting in the spiritual realm, unless that human being was doing something way to far, and even then God may still not intervene and sever it because of free will in creation.  But if God will not ever sever a cord of a human who is astral projecting.  Are there any other entities that lack the power of God, that have ever succeeded in severing the cord of a human being that was astral projecting.

  <br>
  I do not believe that God or the Holy Angels would sever the cord of a human being that is astral projecting in the spiritual realm, unless that human being was doing something way to far, and even then God may still not intervene and sever it because of free will in creation. I also feel God would send a Holy Angel to warn the person to stop something incorrect he might be doing, before God would take the action of severing a human's cord during projection.  But if God will not ever sever a cord of a human who is astral projecting.  Are there any other entities that lack the power of God, that have ever succeeded in severing the cord of a human being that was astral projecting.  There are of course fallen angels, malicious entities, and demonic entities that roam somewhere in the spiritual planes.  It's probably more likely that these entities do not have the power, devices, or ability to sever a humans cord who is astrally projecting.  However, they can probably attack a human who is astrally projecting and cause the human some kind of spiritual pain or damage, until the human can shake his consciousness back into his physical body.  Has anyone who has ever astral projected ever been attacked by an harmful entity in the spiritual realm.  I've heard there are certain herbs or flower essences or crystals that one can put next to their physical body while astral projecting that will protect them from harmful entities during their travels.  I do not know whether these things work or not, someone on the forum might know.
  <br>
  Concerning the question of what happens to someone when they die, and their silver cord is severed?  Does some force move them into a new spiritual dimension within 5 minutes of the death, say to a bright light where loved ones are waiting.  Does this procedure not always work, and sometimes there is not bright light or loved ones, and the person is just left in the spiritual realm at the physical location where he died.  Then once the person realizes in his particular situation something has gone wrong and there is no bright light or loved ones, does he just begin to interact with all the other astral life on that realm that is directly linked to the Earth.  Say that is the case, would that person have the ability to move out of that realm on his own, and travel to higher astral or spiritual planes to seek answers.  Or would that person after death lose his ability to move to any other astral or spiritual planes.
  <br>
  Here is a question.  Maybe some of us go to heaven, maybe some go to Hell, and maybe the rest that are in between get re-incarnated.
  <br>
  If anyone has any ideas or knows the answers to any of these questions, please reply and express your views and ideas.

I couldn't find the "edit" icon, so I hope you can make out the small print above.  It only gave me two choices, one was the profile, and the other was a quote.
<br>
Another interesting question.  If a person learned how to harness chi very well while they were in their human physical body, such as like a lot of martial artists have done through out the world.  Could a person in the spiritual realm also increase their strength by us the same methods in the spiritual realm.  As everyone is aware these martial artists and others who have learned to absorb chi can perform unbelievable feats of strength, and easily throw back an attacker or opponent.  Just a question to think about.

I think that in my 400 or so posts, this is the first time I've actually resurrected a thread, instead of starting a whole new topic !
<br>
<br>
I think that this "search engine" business is something I need to get into a bit more.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to business : the silver cord. Now, I've never seen it, though I've only had a few projections. I have felt a force dragging me back to my body.
<br>
<br>
This is taken from William Buhlman's "Secrets of the soul" :
<br>
<br>
<u>
 <b>
  Observation of the Silver Cord
 </b>
</u>
<br>
<br>
The very fact that young children are observing the biblical silver cord is significant because they have not yet been led to believe in it. Children's observations provide additional evidence that the cord truly does exist.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Around the age of four I had an OBE while sleeping. I was floating in the upper corner of my bedroom and looking down at my body asleep in the bed. I was confused, and extremely frightened at what had happened. There was a "plasmalike" cord between my spirit and body, and I quickly went back into my body. ANDREW W, MANASSAS, VIRGINIA.
</i>
<br>
<br>
End of quote.
<br>
<br>
I like the notion that the silver cord has been verified by kids. But at the same time, I believe that the silver cord could possibly be a construct of the mind. The mind is in an unfamiliar environment, and is perhaps trying to rationalise its seperation from the physical body by making the cord ?
<br>
<br>

<br>

Those kids that saw the cord could have heard about it somewhere other than church. I thought most people had heard about the cord theory.
<br>
<br>
In a body that I create by imagination in astral, it could have a cord, tail, 8 legs, or anything I want it to, but the thing it usually doesnt have is my true form.

<section>
I think the biggest misconception is the direction of energy flow.  The energy flows from the highest body to the lowest, not the other way around.  The physical is the end result of a power reduction (decrease in vibrations).  Kind of like the last layer of clothing you put on before leaving the house.  The physical is the weakest of all our bodies and the first and most likely the last to perish.
