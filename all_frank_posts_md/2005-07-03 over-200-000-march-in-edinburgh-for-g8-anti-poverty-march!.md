A fantastic turn out in Edinburgh yesterday for the great 'Make poverty History' march, ahead of the G8 Summit in Gleneagles. 100,000 people were expected to take part, but in the event, both organisers and police estimated that over 200,000 people marched, making it one of the biggest political demonstrations ever held in Scotland.
<br>
<br>
Marchers were encouraged to wear white and as they snaked their way around the streets of the Scottish Capital, they all linked hands at approx. 3pm to form a white band which could be seen from the air, the white band being a symbol of the 'Make Poverty History' movement.
<br>
<br>
Police and participants spoke of a 'carnival atmosphere' and there was no trouble apart from an isolated scuffle between a few anarchists and police which was quickly contained.
<br>
<br>
While 200,000 people is impressive, Bob Geldof has stated that this is only a taster. He wants upwards of one million plus to arrive in the city this coming Wednesday for the 'Great March' to Gleneagles, forty miles to the north of Edinburgh; Wednesday marks the official start of the summit.

All the events went very well and I don't think the G8 summit result is too bad, it's a good start at least. Well worth the effort.
<br>
<br>
Most of the protests and marches held over the week, both in Edinburgh, as well as Gleneagles itself, and elsewhere in Scotland, were in fact very peaceful and enjoyable and a great time was had by all. The trouble caused by a small minority of anarchist types was not really that serious and these isolated incidents were exaggerated and obsessively focused on by the media, while less effort was put into showing the rather more positive and enjoyable vibe that was the experience for most people...  Typical media distortion!  The good will present over the week was only marred by Thursday's events in London.
