I had a very funny OOBe last night.(untriggered)
<br>
<br>
I found myself in a scenario, walking down the stairs because I supposedly heard some noise downstairs, but there was nothing, so while I was walking up again I suddenly thought of making a major leap, and to my great surprise I kept floating in the air, heading towards the bathroom door. I was like: woooow I CAN LEVITATE!. On top of this went right through the door! That made me really uncomfortable.. I kind of thought/felt to myself hey, one step at a time, you just learned to levitate!
<br>
<br>
Then I woke up. Not the first time I had an supposedly oobe(unless it's somekind of advanced dream) where I start levitating and think it's really the REAL DEAL!.. [|)]

Lol;)

I also remember the first time it happened to me..such a surprise! It's amazing how much time it took me to learn that I don't have to walk  in the astral world, but I can fly instead. Congratulations!

Not being subject to gravity takes some getting used to. Astral flight is an art which I still have some difficulty with. Taking off and flying is fine, but my landings are awful.

Limiting thoughts bring you back to your body.

You got a point there Beavis, thanks for sharing that.
<br>
<br>
Where the thought came from?
<br>
<br>
You see, it wasn't until I woke up, that I realized it must've been a projection. While the projection/event took place I thought it was the physical plane you, I and everyone else find ourselves in everyday. I guess you could say, that I wasn't over the SHOCK that I could flyyyyy like a bird(hadn't even started the celebrations), so moving through doors was like DOUBLE TROUBLE, the "waaaah whaats happening" effect..[:O]
<br>
<br>
This wasn't the first time, I just felt like sharing this one, it's soo hilarious that every time I fool myself into believing that it's real...on earth you know..[

Something similar happened to me a while back.  I was being chased down a road by a man, running for dear life, then suddenly thought "I wonder if I can fly out of this?"  I flew/jumped over some gardens &amp; glided gently before landing softly flat on my face.  That was when I realized I was either in an LD or AP.  Then I woke up before I could take it further [
