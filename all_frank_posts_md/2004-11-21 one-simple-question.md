Does breathing problems (such as a stuffed nose or astma) affect ability to project?

It might make it a little more difficult; but that's all.
<br>
My nose is also always stuffed, my breathing pattern is "horrible"... and I still managed to project.  Just try not to pay attention to it.  Focus on the other stimuli.
<br>
<br>
Good luck.

<section>
It won't affect your actual projections in the sense there is no particular rule that says blocked nose, no projection. But what it may do is hamper your ability to relax sufficiently. I'm assuming you manage to fall asleep okay. If so then I'd say it should make no difference.

I can't fall asleep OK.
<br>
it makes it very easy to achieve "mind awake,body asleep" state,as my mind can't fall asleep due to the nose thing,but my body falls asleep just fine.
