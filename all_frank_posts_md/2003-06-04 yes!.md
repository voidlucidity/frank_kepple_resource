Hey all. [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]
<br>
<br>
I just had another OBE. A short one mind you, but... heh. [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

<br>
<br>
I did some energy work from about 11:30 AM to noon. (It's 12:26 PM now.) I laid down on my back and relaxed into the sleep, sometimes counting 50-1. My body was getting heavy with sleep, and I felt I hit a point where it would go no deeper on my back, so I turned to my left side, with my pillow between my knees. I relaxed into sleep, and counted 50-1; alternating these two as I desired. The imagery started forming, as if submerged in tar, and the vibrations started up right befored or around the imagery.
<br>
<br>
I relaxed into the vibes and into looking into the visions, thinking about a tip Frank gave, and I fell into a dream whereby I was walking across my dressers. This of course alerted me to the fact that it was a dream, besides the fact that it had that same 'submerged in tar' look to it. Realizing this I hesitated on my step to the next dresser and I proceeded to fall off the dresser (in my dream). At the same time I 'fell' forward out of my body, which is really sideways, or parallel to the floor. The shock snapped me right back. Went to my journal. I'll go back in a bit. [

P.S.
<br>
Time from lying down to separation: Ten minutes.

<br>
Take care.

Hey manuel! [

<br>
<br>
Thank you for the reply and the support. In this round of my OBE practices I've been practicing consistently since March 8th, 2003. My next milestone (in real-time) is getting out of the room. [:O]
<br>
<br>
Take care!

<section>
Sweet_Celestial_Sounds. From your description of that short OBE it appears that you have reached a state from which to project. That initial shock of separation is causing you to abort the experience after only a few seconds. That shock will eventually become only a mild, temporary annoyance. It is basically the case of getting used to the sensations and becoming familiar with the process.
<br>
An example is diving into a swimming pool. For some people the shock of hiting the water is very discomforting at first. After a few dives most people get over that discomfort (it becomes merely annoying).
<br>
At that point you will be able to 'stay out' much longer. That is when the really intresting experiences can happen! [

<br>
Yes. I do feel that I have 'arrived'. I have reached a state or a point to where I know I can project- I just need to be able to lenghten the experience and get some distance away. (Practice. [

Great analogy Greytraveller. It
<i>
 is
</i>
a 'shock' to just 'fall' out of the body like that, and so quickly. I like the slow ones where I can just roll out. But it seems some like this will come, so I best get used to it. [:O]
<br>
<br>
I anticipate the really deep ones. You can bet that I'm there!
<br>
<br>
Take care.

Wow. I have those those things sometimes. I usually go from alert to deep sleep (theta) in a second but sometimes I'm thinking about something and I'll move into a dream-scenario thing. Problem is, I always get a shock that jolts me out of the dream as well as jolting my physical body. Ex: I fall, get electrically shocked, etc. Is there a way to always get to this state?

Hey dino333.
<br>
<br>
We
<i>
 always
</i>
reach this state. It is just how aware you are- being aware enough to realize you've reached this state, and acting accordingly when there. [

Yep, that's absolutely what I found. Couldn't agree more.

Does anyone know how to make the OBEs longer? I've had the same troubles as you, sweet_celestial_clouds, so I was wondering if there are techniques out there that can help us achive that.

<br>
From my experiences and the reports of other people it appears that the ability to stay out of body is a result of both intention and repeated experience. Mentally note to yourself the intention to remain 'out' before each meditation or induction session. After a few experiences the time spent away from the physical should increase to 10 to 15 minutes or more.
