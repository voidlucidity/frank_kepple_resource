<section>
I awoke this morning.  Without getting too awake and not looking at the time, I turned onto my side, settled in and started looking inwards.
<br>
<br>
I find my "place" for getting the swirling colours seems to be straight ahead, but I need to relax my physical eyes first, so that it feels as if I'm look with "other" eyes.  Difficult to describe really.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I found my spot and enjoyed watching the plumes of coloured smoke.  I got a very tiny green square, which I tried to latch onto, but that went as soon as I did.  Then a bit later I realised that I was looking at textured wallpaper.  I mean the whole of my vision had switched.  It was wallpaper everywhere – 3D.  Unfortunately, I get too excited when this happens because I always think I'm starting to get somewhere and my physical eyes start looking, which takes me back to 2D blackness.
<br>
<br>
Rather than give up, I continued looking at the spot and watched the 2D blackness wondering if I'd blown it for the day.  Then the plumes came back, so I enjoyed them again for a while.  Once again, a bit later, I got the 3D effect – it's never that lovely velvet black that everyone else talks about – I get wallpaper!  I would have to be different, wouldn't I?  For the second time, I tried to hold it, but I lost it again.
<br>
<br>
Then I rolled onto my back, arms above my head and drifted away.  F1 to F2.
<br>
<br>
I was dreaming.  I was in some big old hotel.  The dream is irrelevant to this story, until I start to climb the wooden staircase.  As I'm climbing it, I switch from F2 to F1.  Now by this, I don't mean I become lucid.  I become
<u>
 more than
</u>
lucid.  I wake up and I can see my dream going on in my head.  I feel I may have lost it, so I start focusing on what I'm doing – climbing a staircase.  I feel the steps underneath me, the feel of the wood against my hand on the handrail.  I touch the side panelling and ta-da!  I've phased back into the dream.  I even have time to think to myself, "this is more like it, I can feel the wood, this is how it should be done, climbing staircases might be a good rundown for me."
<br>
<br>
I'm now totally back in the dream, completely lucid, and go off searching for someone, calling their name.
<br>
<br>
Progress, progress, progress!

Not sure if you will be the same but I tend to see textures just before the 3D Blackness (Fz) state. Not always, sometimes I Phase right through it but often I'll take the transitions really slowly and it's greyish cloudy formations, swirls of coloured cloudy formations, textures and ink blots, and then Fz. My 3D Blackness is almost always punctuated by loads of stars. Well, they look like stars but they are not really. The view is like looking at the night sky.

<section>
Aha!  So I'm giving up slightly before that gorgeous velvety blackness?
<br>
<br>
I'll keep on at it then - but getting past that wallpaper is tricky.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the clarification.

There is always a progression to the experience. Mystics tend to call them "levels" but then that term becomes morphed into the idea of lower and higher and angels and demons, etc. But think of it like you were stripping off layers. Focusing your attention on different layers of experience. As you encounter a layer, peel it away and that will reveal the next layer, and so on. There are an infinite number of layers so it all depends upon what grabs your attention. You can just keep peeling them away forever. Of course, the more you peel away the deeper "in" to yourself you go, until you reach the entirely subjective layers. Then you become the concept of a layer. Which is rather whacky and fun.

so what level is the "Seeing the starry sky" again, and what are the "stars" really. Also, what does it mean when semi-transparent clouds are in the "sky" thanx

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It's not a "level" it is a state, a particular mental focus of attention known as the 3D-Blackness at the Monroe Focus 21 state or Fz of my Phasing Model of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Recently, when I have been trying to do a rundown and then switch back to looking at the back of my eyelids, I will see some textures that look like fingerprints as the backdrop to the blackness. Is this the same thing? If so, what should I do to bring on the 3D Blackness?

<section>
ok, what are the "stars" really, and what does it usually mean when there are semi-transparent clouds in the sky. I remember this only happening once out of 4-5 times of me seeing the "starry sky"
<br>
<br>
Also as a side note, when ever I'd look "up" it'd get real intense and I'd have to look away or even worse wake up with the urge to scream. Not out of fear, just intensity.

This is the exact texture I get before FZ.  Kind of a translucent, silvery, swirly, fingerprint pattern.  Although, when I get there FZ could still be 20 minutes away due to the fact I am not that good at keeping my physical eyes from "latching on".  Most times I never even get to FZ after I see the patterns, but that is changing.  My biggest problem with FZ, besides getting there, is "stepping in" to the starry night so I can float around and concentrate on  winning the lottery.

I've never been to FZ on a Phasing attempt, but this morning I found that spot in my mind when I tried the Noticing exercise. I didn't get wallpaper or fingerprints, I got really colorful fractals. Everything looks ultra-complex and very unnatural.
<br>
<br>
I didn't get to notice for very long, unfortunately. I'm lucky I can go to work as late as I do already ...
