Hello, i'm Gem

<br>
<br>
I found this site whilst wandering round the net and thought it looked interesting. I'm in to all sorts of things spiritual and 'paranormal' and have had experiences of this nature over many many years.
<br>
<br>
I'm a mad gemini, hence the name!

Thank you to Adrian who sorted my registration problems for me!

Hey Gem,
<br>
<br>
I just saw another post from you in a different section. Noticing your name here, I figured I'd say hi, especially since you're on the same island as I am (UK, right?) Anyways, you ever wanna talk directly to some specific, feel free to send me a message. I welcome any opportunity to talk about all things esoteric/spiritual nature, provided I know something about it (and even if don't - learning is a fun thing).
<br>
<br>
See ya around!
