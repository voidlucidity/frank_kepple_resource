Helen - I had a very similar problem to yours for many years.... so long in fact that the constant fear was actually affecting my health!
<br>
see *my very first post* - 'obe fears affecting my health need help'
<br>
<br>
For me, the biggest help was actually finding this forum and talking to other often more experienced AP'ers and reading as much about the astral world as possible - the more you know about it the less scary it becomes
<br>
It is also re-assuring to know that no matter how scary somthing seems to you, someone else has already done it and is far ahead of you, what you are afraid of is just a breeze to them!!
<br>
<br>
This helped me a lot, so when I started getting the vibrations AP stuff I was able to think, 'hell, people like Frank, Jeff Mash etc dont have a problem with this, why should I?'
<br>
<br>
I was then able (after years of fear) to get over it and I'm now getting on quite well thank you, with a good few APs under my belt!
<br>
<br>
So, try not to worry and just remember that its not actually quite the 'great unknown' that you thought.... the fear is unwarrented!
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>

Helen, I was also terrified for years. I started having nightmares (which I know now are OBEs) when I was about sixteen, and it went on until about a year ago when I started reading up on astral projecion. I'm 25 now -that's nine years of being afraid to go to sleep!
<br>
<br>
Simply breaking through the fear can help. The way I think of it, it's the old flight-or-fight reaction going on. The moment I decided during one of my experiences to fight rather than fly, the whole nature of the thing changed for me. It's been a truly amazing thing to learn what all that fear was leading towards, and I know what I've experienced is still only the tip of the iceberg.
