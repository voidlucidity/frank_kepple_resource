After work yesterday I again worked with the Wave-1 cds. Then, later in the evening, I listened again. This time I finally experienced having no sensation whatsoever of my physical body. The feeling was pleasant too.
<br>
<br>
I remembered about focusing inward, and did so. There were some distinct patterns that appeared. Some lighter than others, one a beautiful blue. So, I stayed with them, and then a separate form began taking shape. Before I could stay with it very long the cd was ending with sound tones that brought me back. I never did get to see what that last form was going to be.
<br>
<br>
To all of you w/ more background in astral phasing, is what I've described in any way a beginning astral experience?
<br>
<br>
p.s. amazingly vivid dreams last night as well.

Nick: It sounds like you achieved Focus 10 and kick-started the natural Phasing process and you progressed to Focus 12.
<br>
<br>
When you begin seeing all kinds of abstract shapes or swirling colours or textures or patterns, and so forth, that is Focus 12. Focus 10 is where you split from perceiving imaginary mental imagery that you were consciously generating as part of your rundown, to viewing imagery which is being transmitted to you.
<br>
<br>
The transmission of imagery begins at Focus 12. The transition between F10 and F12 is normally perceived as quick and seamless. But, after some practice, you can hold yourself at each state. (Not that there is any real need to hold yourself at Focus 10. I only practiced doing it more out of curiosity than anything.)
<br>

Frank,
<br>
<br>
This evenings session with Wave-1 brought forth Focus 12 impressions as you have described. All of this is a real breakthrough for me. Exciting times.
<br>
<br>
As ever, your posts are instructive and helpful. Thanks again.

Hi Nick...just back from yoga where I am able to engage F12 to give incredible sensation to both the pose and the energy body. I know what you mean about the guided tape...great to get you started and use the prepatory steps...good visualizations...but often find that it all ends too quickly...amazing as I think the sessions go on for nearly 45 minutes. Another tip...that white sound...it's very similar to what you hear on a B747. Fortunately, I travel a lot for work and find myself spending up to 2-3 hours on flights...so I use that time well for meditating (seeing that they don't feed you on planes anymore!)The sensation I often experience is that the body is leaden and the astral/energy body starts to float up...I've been known to hit F10 and just sit up...this was sensed by a channeler who was doing a healing for me. I (my astral body) stood behind him while he worked on my physical body. The dreams are definitely a bonus...what we do in our work is keep a journal...even if you cannot recall the previous night...tho' you know you've been dreaming...just record that. But in time you capture not only the drama but the textures of colour, sound, emotion...the vividness is the sharpening of your mind in training as you focus and open to a new awareness. Keep at it...try it without the tapes...just use the techniques..i.e. the prepartory phases...most importantly...OM'ing...the sounds raise the vibrational levels...do it often even when not meditating..in the shower (sounds great!)...driving down the road (better than road rage!)...it clears the mind of clutter...prepares you to focus. I sent you more info on the other thread...good luck in your efforts.

As you begin to perceive those impressions try and remain as mentally still and as
<u>
 neutral
</u>
as possible. Simply be a passive observer and just let events unfold. Getting scared or excited tends to zap you out of it. I thought it might be useful to mention that sometimes you can perceive shapes that look a little fearsome. I always remember the time when it looked like the head of a large wolf was pressing against my face.

Frank, you were most fortunate to meet your spirit guide...I too have the wolf as my power animal. I take great comfort when he appears and know we walk in step. I like your advice to remain neutral and observant...fear is just imagination. These are real opportunities to explore beyond the physical body...and there is sooooo much more out there! Cheers all...

Frank,

<br>
Thanks for the suggestion, will aim for that stillness and neutrality no matter what shapes take form.
<br>

Very best,
