Hello, I've been browsing the forum for awhile, when I was more focused on astral projection than anything else. But now, I am working more on keeping my energies/chakras in balance, and raising my sensitivity to everything. I've been working with air magic &amp; telekenesis, but i'm not very advanced there. I'd like to assist anyway I can, and hopefully bring a little more personality to the forums in all.
