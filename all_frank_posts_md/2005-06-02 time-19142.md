<section>
Ive had an interesting thought.
<br>
<br>
Time is relative, correct?
<br>
<br>
If we can realize this and apply it to OBE practices, isnt it possible to have OBEs that last hundreds of years? relatively speaking, of course. you would wake up maybe an hour later in physical time or something.
<br>
<br>
Is this possible? Any mods or experianced OBErs have comments?

I think not...time is relative but not so relative i suppose. But..who knows...i mean, maybe we are obing right now and when we die we will see that we were "sleeping" and wake up for real life...like in Matrix or Existenz movies.
<br>
<br>
<br>
better to check with real obbers.

Deja vu has a scientific explanation and, besides , we cannot give paranormal explanations for everything.
<br>
<br>
Its om to believe in OBEs, etc etc but its better t do not exagerate, in my opinion.

<section>
cassiopaeans are saying that deja vu...is when you've experienced something that one of your other dimensional bodies has experienced. that we're all connected on a unconscious level (collective) with millions of other selves. 2012 (roughly) they talk about a merging of all the selves, which they refer to as the moment of enlightenment...they say it could "appear" to last forever, but it'll just be a moment in time.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Just as the deja-vu topic comes up we get the 2012 topic. Happens every time. It's like deja-vu but all over again.
