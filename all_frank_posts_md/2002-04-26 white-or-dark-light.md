  <br>
  Somehow, IMO, it is like a chess game between Dark and Light Played in third density and the incarnations are the playing pieces. Just as in chess, there are 2 colors. In this case black and white.. So in order to play in their game, you must choose a side.Surrounding yourself with white light identifies you, on the astral, as a light side player.Surrounding yourself with black light identifies you as a Dark side player...These auras are used so that the polarities know who their allies and enemies are and will act accordingly...Protective?

  somehow I don't think so..If anything, using polarity light will encourage attacks by the opposing side since it radiates like a beacon in the astral....

There is a depth behind what you say and a gravity that I've felt for SO long.

<section>
good job grenade01.
<br>
<br>
as for the white light radiating like a beacon, focus the "radiation" inward and stop it from radiating outward. that way it should only attract the ones that are close enough to be able to sense you anyway. and if you strengthen the white light and "become" white light yourself (though i guess people might say this is an advanced thing to do), it makes the most amazing shield. but like i said else where, i don't like to shield much [

]. (maybe that's why i get the crap beat out of me sometimes [

]. haha.)
