<section>
John Peel, Radio 1 DJ in the UK, down-to-earth, unassuming, music man died today.
<br>
<br>
He paved the way for such bands as The Undertones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and many many more "independent" music bands.
<br>
<br>
If it wasn't for him, thousands of people wouldn't have heard their favourite tunes.
<br>
<br>
He was a "legend" and should have been knighted.  He was very much a family man and wasn't afraid to let this be known.
<br>
<br>
He shall be missed by many who never even met him.
<br>
<br>
A question.  If thousands upon thousands of alive people are thinking about someone who has just passed on, how does this affect the recently deceased?

I bet he will be having a real ball and taking the accolades he rightly deserves. He will no doubt be spinning disks in the radio station in the sky now... I wonder if we can tune in... you never know!

Awe, he was a classic, one of the best. When I was younger I used to have my ear glued to the radio when his show came on. That voice of his was just so dry along with his humour.

Same here, Frank. Back at university we were always keen to hear what he'd pull out of the bag next.

(in scouse accent) "This one's a 10" release, pressed on clear vinyl. Hope you enjoy it."
