<section>
Hello,
<br>
<br>
I am a new member as of 10 min. I have been psychically developing of 1 month(concerted effort) I have been psychically interested as of 1 year.  I have been spiritual as of 2 years.
<br>
<br>
My latest subject in this broad range of 'paranormal' is astral projection. I just recently rented a book from the library on astral projection, being my first and only book on it - that is Bruce's 'Astral Dynamics' and I have been inspired enough by him to attempt projection every night(sometimes in the morning) so far to no avail, but I believe in being optimistic. I have had a few OBE like experiences before which happened very spontaneously. I say 'OBE-like' as it was difficult to distinguish whether they were lucid dreams or real experiences in the astral. What, I do distinctly remember, that I left my body through my heart center or solar plexus center, as if I was being pulled out of my body with a great force.  It would be nice to do the same consciously.
<br>
<br>
So something about me, who I am, what kind of beliefs I entertain etc. Well I am data, information. Note, how I introduce the subject as 'New Data' and that is exactly how I will be categorized in the forum database, as a string of characters and each character represented as a binary string. Similarly, it is my knowing, that everything in this universe, is represented by it's quantum string - it's unique energetic signature. No, two signatures are the same, just like no two snow flakes are the same.
<br>
<br>
Thereupon, lies the foundation of my philosophy in life. We are all truly unique. Special within our own right. We can all learn from each other, share with each other and teach each other. As an interconnected collective of souls we form the greater whole of god.
<br>
<br>
Comprehension becomes much easier, when we reduce all objects to their quantum wave function. We see in quantum mechanics that a single event can have a particle and wave nature and particles can exist in super positioned states. We see that two particles anywhere in space-time can communicate with each other. We can see that all events obey a vibrational continuum.
<br>
<br>
Now, see how easy it is to translate all these microcosmic effects into macro-cosmic consciousness effects. There is a scientific basis to psychic phenomena, because there is a scientific basis to quantum entanglement. There is a scientific basis to spiritual realities, because there is a scientific basis to a vibrational continuum. We are made of very same constituents that comprise this universe, and therefore we are subject to the same universal phenomena.
<br>
<br>
It is a very simple affair(at least I consider it such) and makes so much sense. I wonder why it confounds so many. The science is not the magic of it, the magic is within the thought, feelings, actions. The magic is in life itself. I am sure there is a very complex bio-quantum dynamical process on why someone becomes happy. Yet, the magic is, that you do not need to understand the complexities and intricacies of this process to be happy. You just be happy.
<br>
<br>
It has taken me a long time to make this realization. It's not the how or why that is important, which forms the scientific doctrine, and without the how or why, or empirical data, fundamentalist scientists refuse to consider or acknowledge phenomena. Psychic phenomena and metaphysics have been sidelined for quite some time due to this institutional myopia.
<br>
<br>
Yet, the irony is, what they reject on the basis of lack of empirical evidence, is the very substance they are using every moment - consciousness - I am - the very first experience or knowing we have.
<br>
<br>
So, I have learned to just accept things as they are - as I feel them - to completely personalize phenomena in this universe. I am sure one day scientists will discover the equation of god. Yet, who can have a relationship with an equation?
<br>
<br>
I ask why needlessly complicate something so simple, just call him father/mother and forge a relationship with him. Similarly, you don't need to know what is the logic of love, you just love - you just let it be. You don't need to know the logic of being - you just are. This is when the universe became very simple for me to understand. All that sappy love, light and peace, made SO MUCH sense.
<br>
<br>
I think this will be enough for an introductory post

Hi!
<br>
Excellent post, but why everyone mentions "light" near "love"?

Thank you for your welcome friends.
<br>
<br>
CaCodeMoN, it's just how it is. Let it be

However, a thought just occurred to me. Just like matter and energy is interchagable, so is love and light.

<section>
Great intro, some good points
<br>
<br>
I get what your saying with the whole complexity issue. Scientists spend there whole lives studying WHY we are happy, only to realize, they didnt discover the answer, they discovered the equation
