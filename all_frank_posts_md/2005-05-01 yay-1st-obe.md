well 1st things first
<br>
<br>
WOHOOOO I OBE'D!!!!!!
<br>
<br>
I got woken up rather early cos the car wouldnt start, after getting that sussed sat down and read some of the obe advice etc given out here and listened to BWG, after about an hour I jumped into bed, I was kinda cold so I rolled onto my stomach and put my arms under my body (try it somtime when its cold)
<br>
<br>
I was having a dream where I was doing some sparring with my friend in an old car park somewhere, in the middle of the night, there was some other people there but I dunno who they where, anyway I noticed that my friend had made 2 of himself and I thought well i'll do that as well,  instead of creating 2 of myself I was immediatly floating in the air strangly enough in the same position that i went to sleepin.   I floated upward lookin down, the other people came running over and stared as i drifted up above them, then I flipped over so I was looking at the sky and started speeding up after I slowed down, i was floating in the air in a standing position moving along at no great speed kinda just cruising, the car park was long gone and I was above the ocean, there was a brillient full moon and the light was glistening off the water, at this point I started to lose it and i started descending toward the water, and after that I woke up.
<br>
<br>
it was a rather short obe but it still counts, anyway the whole time this was happening i couldnt move my arms from where they where and I had little control over what actually happened, is this one of those things that gets better with pratice? anyone reccomend and exercises that i can do so I can exibit a bit more control...
<br>
<br>
still it was F&amp;8KING awesome

Congratulations,
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to ask you. Do you live near the ocean?
<br>
<br>
You said you were dreaming, before you had the OBE, how do you know you weren't still dreaming?
<br>
<br>
I've had a few OBE experiences like these by dreams as well.

when I fly in dreams its the same as walking about but after I had a few near projections I found that in projection I can feel my body it kinda feels like I am wearing a full body spandex suit, in dreams I am not aware that my body exists

Blank, but do you live near the ocean?
<br>
<br>
I once had an OBE experience where I could at will levitate above my body by sound. It felt so real and it was definitely a remarkable experience. Then I told my friends about my experience. I then woke up and realized I dreamt everything, even the part where I told my friends.
<br>
<br>
I've had many similar OBE like experiences, each indistinguishable from a dream. To me it sounds like your experience was a dream.

Blank: Congratulations on the experience. I have noticed that I am having all my success when I wake up in the morning, stay up for a short bit (shorter than what you did) and lay back down and try Frank's "noticing" technique. It appears that the trick for you was waking up and going back to bed, as well.

Blank,
<br>
Flying dreams are a good indication that you are close.
<br>
Dont count anything as obe, if the transition from waking to obe and obe to waking was not seamless.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Congrats on the experience. Many people have all manner of difficulties in movement and so on. These go away with practice and after a while you'll be able to change your perception in a more controlled way. It's best if you resist the urge to fly here and there. Flying around is enjoyable, but I only do it now if I want to just have fun flying around.
<br>
<br>
You need to start trying to ground your thinking and learn to change your perception gradually. I found the best most productive state is to remain emotionally neutral, just release a mild curiosity and see what turns up. Otherwise events can easily start running away with you and you lose it.
<br>
<br>
I lost it for the first time in ages the other morning. I was moving forwards fairly quickly and the "ground" suddenly came to a stop, like a cliff edge, and I suddenly found myself hanging in mid air looking down at the "water" about 300 feet below. The change was so quick it caught me off guard and I actually zapped right back to physical. This hasn't happened for ages, and would not have happened if I hadn't been impatient to get to where I was going.
<br>
<br>
You don't want the changes to take place too quickly else a part of you can freak and zap you back to physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
