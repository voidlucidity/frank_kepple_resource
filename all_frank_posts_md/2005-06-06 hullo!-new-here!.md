Hi, my name's Justin and I've been lurking for about a week now. I finally just registered. I'm 23 and a college student. I've always been fascinated with astral travel. The first OOBE that I remember happened when I was about 4 (I have a pretty good memory). I remember getting up out of my bed and leaving my room. My feet weren't touching the floor and my legs weren't moving. It felt like having roller skates on after you build up enough speed and just let them roll you along.
<br>
<br>
I approached the hallway and went into the bathroom, phased through the wall and gently glided on the air until I reached the back yard of the house next door, then I landed in the grass. It was early morning, about 6 or 7 o'clock during summer. The sky was blue and I remember hearing a gentle, peaceful melody. The grass was really green too. That's all I remember of it though and I'll never forget it.
<br>
<br>
In my late teens my father finally got a computer and I began surfing the net, often researching things like, astral projection, ESP, magick, etc. I started practicing meditation to learn to clear my mind to achieve better results in my psychic practices, like aura viewing and telekinesis. I learned how to see auras but never got the hang of TK. I soon stopped meditating though because I started feeling other presences besides myself sometimes and I'd be alone. I didn't like feeling like that and hoped that I'd stop feeling those presences and it did stop almost immediately.
<br>
<br>
About a year ago I began getting interested in ESP again and felt that I was a little stronger to face whatever's "out there". I also wanted to find a way to enhance my precognition because I had had quite a few precognitive dreams that came true (good things), I'd always know when a certain song would come on the radio and said out loud once "this song is on the radio right now" (just to make it feel more real and not so coincidental) and when I turned on the radio it was on. Also I think I had a telepathic experience while I was talking to a friend on the phone. She was talking about this person who I've never met before and I somehow cut her off and started telling her something about what the girl had said. My friend was like "how did you know?" I said "I don't know" and my friend was pretty freaked about it for a minute.

Anyway, during this time, I was having lucid dreams often and they weren't good ones. They were downright
<b>
 terrifying
</b>
and I noticed that they usually happened if I slept on my back, which I rarely do but I guess somewhere in the middle of the night or early morning I'd end up on my back. This went on for a good year and finally subsided last year. The last really bad lucid dream I had, ended up being a "two-for-one", which means I had two lucid dreams in just one night, where both times my body was paralyzed and something would be in my room with me. First it was a "Were-Man" like creature that stood on two legs that slowly rose from the side of my bed, and darted for me which caused my body to jerk and I fully awoke. I went to sleep again and had another lucid dream. This time there were zombies outside my room. It was dark and my mom ended up opening my door and said "Justin, do I look any different to you?" and she turned on my light and she was a zombie. Then all the zombies came rushing in my room and grabbed me by my neck and my body jerked me awake again. That was a bad night.
<br>
<br>
Since then, I haven't had any lucid dreams as bad. The night I found this site last week, I was actually able to astral project on command. I read that the easiest time to do it was when you first wake up and I was able to do it on my first try. I was able to do it again the next night too but with slightly better results. I'll save it for the astral experience thread or something. I've rambled on long enough.
