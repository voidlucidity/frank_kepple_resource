<section>
I would love to see the Brainwave Gen as a freeware..
<br>
I just don't have a fortune to pay with to be able to download Bwg-Gen version that excepts Presents files and I'm not finding a way around it either so-to-say...
<br>
Anyone got away to help with this without spending a fortune?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I think this may be a question for Adrian. The Brainwave generator I remember looking at ages ago but it wasn't something I explored. I'm not saying it isn't any good or anything. I was just on another tangent, that's all.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
