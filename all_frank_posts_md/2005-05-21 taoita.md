Hello!  I am finally writing about myself because it didn't cross my mind to talk before now...hmm.  I am a trainee teacher and I live in the UK having lived here all my life speaking English and studying language.
<br>
<br>
There are so many things that interest me that I confess to you secretly now that I am totally talentless but pretty enthusiastic! My true weakness is getting bored and picking up on teen attitude so taoita is a personal reminder to me that what is true cannot be spoken.
<br>
<br>
I have been putting my foot in it and focusing my awareness on movement and mediaattention, sorry meditation, for about 10 years and since that time I have made absolutely no social progress at all - I mean really!  I have very few friends with similar interests to me so i am a very contradictory personality with strange aptitudes and abilities.
<br>
<br>
Recently, I started on the magnum opus Mastering Astral Projection - (awful book cover) which I thought would fast track me into astral awareness and yepp, I am still making tracks...YAY!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help sincerely...taoitax

Thanks Frank, Selski and Nick.

You reminded me of a quotation from a David Gray album..."I don't want no other distractions, there's too much here to see".
