<section>
OK, been trying to AP for about 1 week, and almost had success, although I have some questions.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I went to bed early, around 9:30 PM or so. Started to breath, doing 4/2 breaths and repeating body asleep, mind awake in my mind.
<br>
<br>
<br>
now. sometime in this I kept drifting in and out, my mouth got dry a couple of times, and I needed swallow and that brought me out, but I did know I was in some deep trance or what ever.
<br>
<br>
Sometime later, I was dreaming.
<br>
<br>
It was a weird dream, but for some reason that landscape was familiar, like I have been in this dream world before. I know I have.
<br>
<br>
Cant really remember what I was doing, but the dream jumped from scene to scene, one minute I was on a roof trying to get in a building, the next i was in a car with my x girl.
<br>
<br>
She was driving crazy, and I was in the car with her, and she drove into a river, yet I didn't fall in with her.... I was scared to dive in afterwards after her, I looked at there was this other  female next to me, and I asked, "did she (my girlfriend) really fall in this water? The girl said yes, that others dived in to get her.
<br>
<br>
I was about to jump in, until someone pulled her out, only, her leg came out, and then I pulled her leg, but then I was in my room, and as I pulled her out, I was pulling her from UNDER my own bed, she came stiff, wet, dead looking, and came out with a first clenched full of money.
<br>
<br>
Then i was like, what the heck? I am dreaming? She disappeared, and then I kind of felt myself on my bed, and said if I am dreaming, fly through the roof....
<br>
<br>
all of a sudden, I felt myself in my room again, in real life, only as I tried to fly away, I felt weird vibrations, like traveling really fast, yet going no where, thats when something scared me....
<br>
<br>
It could have been my cat moving around the bed, but I felt something on my chest holding me down. I felt the sheets on me, and it seemed heavy, like it wouldn't let me "fly away"....
<br>
<br>
I also felt something, a presence in the room. It was weird, it felt like it was standing right next to me, I couldn't tell if it was good or bad, it felt, neutral.
<br>
<br>
then, i lost it, and woke up not fully, and felt weird, because i was laying in a weird position, with one of my hands under my back (thats how I know I was in deep trace state) moved around, and said I should write this down.
<br>
<br>
the dream seemed real, but of course it was a dream.
<br>
<br>
Now, it seems as though some AP can and will be confused for dreams, because they seem real. When I pulled my ex- girlfriend out from the water pool, that turned into my room I felt her leg, and felt the water on her, and felt myself trying to giver her CPR.... yet, it was a dream, but it felt weird.
<br>
<br>
<br>
So now, although i almost had an OBE, it seems to me this AP experience, many can be confusing it for lucid dreaming. because  it dream seemed real, but it was just a dream of course.
<br>
<br>
But I did feel something while telling myself i was dreaming and try fly away. Again, it felt like my body wanted to take off on a rocket ship, weird vibrations, starting from the center of my heart and spread outward to my whole body.
<br>
<br>
It seemed like I was going up, chest first, but something kept me down. I kind of got scared and then it went away....
<br>
<br>
<br>
maybe someone can tell my what stages I was in, or if anyone has had this experience. or how close was I.

I was doing well when I started reading your message - then I got more and more befuddled the further on I got...
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I can tell you that feeling weight on you is perfectly normal - I've had this before.  It felt like I'd got about 12 blankets on me.  It just frustrated me.
<br>
<br>
And feeling presences - yes, that's normal too.  The best bet is to learn to ignore them, and get on with what you are doing.  They tend to leave you alone (in my opinion anyway).
<br>
<br>
Maybe someone else can give you a more rounded view of what you experienced, but I thought I'd pick up on the couple of points that were familiar to me.
<br>
<br>
Good luck with future experiences!

<section>
would like to add, that the vibrations I felt, felt like going downhill on a rollercoster,  only it was an upward feeling, I guess like feeling like your going downhill on a roller coster, but your really going up.
<br>
<br>
also interested in if anyone else feels "presences" around when they do this.
<br>
<br>
It did feel as though something or someone was with me, I was really scared, just  kind of shocked....like sensing something you cant see. Really weird.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
One of the most shocking experiences for beginners is having what I call "overlay" experiences. There are 4 primary areas of consciousness and they are heavily intertwined. You may be projected into the RTZ and viewing your room, yet you may see fleeting glimpses of other people here and there. They are not "in your room" in the normal physical sense. You may be viewing an overlay of several areas of consciousness at once.
<br>
<br>
This is perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of this art and it has lead to all manner of weird and whacky theories of hauntings and so on.
<br>
<br>
The presence you felt was probably just another aspect of yourself. Other aspects of yourself are one of the first "entities" people tend to meet as they are resident within Focus 2 of consciousness. It would appear the most common overlay for beginners is a Focus 1 &amp; 2 overlay. This causes the typical reaction of, "Help, there is someone in my room!"
<br>
<br>
Yep, it's yourself, lol.
<br>
<br>
Many people are, unfortunately, riding a never-ending ghost-train, fighting all manner of different aspects of themselves in a kind of perpetual F1/F2 overlay. Many people who project never seem to actually get away from Focus 2. In a sense that's why I like the Monroe model as it skirts past F2 and leads direct to F3, i.e. Monroe F21.
<br>
<br>
This neatly eliminates all the confusion that typically arises within F2 of consciousness, which is where most "mystics" typically hang out; either doing "battle" with their fears, or they engage in all manner of mystical roll-plays such as "pathworking".
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Interesting. So the presence I felt was really my "astral double"...it makes sense, I can see how that could be.
<br>
<br>
But I am also interested in these "guides" people talk about. If you have met your guide, what or who is it? What is your guides gender? How old is your guide?
<br>
<br>
I do think I was having a lucid dream, but when I told me self to "fly through the roof" I think I began my OBE. But the presence in the room kind of woke me up. I think I was in the begining stages of my OBE, but couldnt finish it.
<br>
<br>
I do know that my body was alseep as I did not know my arm was behind my back. It was an interesting expirence. I will try it every night, as the more I try, to more I get close to doing it.
<br>
<br>
One last question. If you astral project in the day time, is it easier? Do you see sunlight? People walking around,ect?

I have met my guide.  It is a he, and he is nothing like me.  I am 6' 3" 220 lbs white.  My guide is 5' 7" 140lbs mexican.  But again I'm sure frank has a more enlightened perspective on spirit guides.  I haven't gotten past F2oc.  I would advise that once you get out, if you have time, ask to speak with your guide.  When I asked out loud I was whisked away to a farm, with a large hill with a big tree on it.  In the tree was something symbolic and personal to me, and I cant tell you, I fear it was given for a reason and if I divulge it I may never receive guidance again.  At this point I direct my point of consciousness into the tree and observe the object.  I also see my guide walk out of the house carrying a greasy wrench and car parts and he walks up to me and give me a reassuring welcome look.  I immediately begin asking all sorts of weird questions.
<br>
<br>
"So, hi, yeah, whats this thing mean?  Oh wait wait wait, let me guess I have to figure it out!  Oh wow this is crazy, do you live here, do you like fixing cars?  Boy I am glad to meet you!"  I was like a giddy school girl.  My guide gave me a look of pure confusion and amusement and just smiled and walked away.  Maybe next time I should give the man a chance to talk.

I keep thinking about my experience....
<br>
<br>
I think that the lucid dream i had about my ex girlfriend had a meaning.
<br>
<br>
I also think, that I might have met my spirt guide, in my dream, and she was female.
<br>
<br>
As the car went into the river I was in it, but when it went it, I was standing outside with this girl.
<br>
<br>
I asked if my x girl went in, she said yes, and that others had went to go get her.
<br>
<br>
Could this be my spirt guide warning me?
<br>
<br>
My Ex has been doing alot of drugs lately, spending money and such. I do not know if this was my subconscious mind, although the girl is the only person I interacted with and had a conversation with.
<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to mention, that when I told my self, fly through the roof , I heard like a spinning sound, like a high powered high pitched fan spinning and it was coming from my chest.... Is this my charka starting up?
<br>
<br>
It was weird, and maybe someone can explain....
<br>
<br>
WHY WHEN I WAS DREAMING IT WAS THROUGH THE FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE, BUT WHEN I TOLD MYSELF TO FLY THROUGH THE ROOF, I WAS IN MY BED, WITH THESE WIERD VIBRATIONS COMING FROM MY CHEST???
<br>
<br>
the chest vibrations were weird.

Look, thing is you are going to meet up with all manner of presences, feelings, sensations, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
Everyone should put this up as a huge banner in their minds. You ARE going to meet with other aspects of yourself. You ARE going to meet with other people, especially "dead" people, lol. And you ARE going to have all manner of weird and whacky unexplainable feelings. That is what this whole game is all about.
<br>
<br>
Okay, I realise you are not, but if anyone should start complaining about any of the basics above then they should get another hobby! :)
<br>
<br>
The vibrations in the area of your chest is the energy centre that exists in the region of your heart. Mystics call it the heart Chakra but I hesitate to use the word Chakra as there are just too many belief constructs attached. Airplane noises, whooshings and whirrings and all manner of things besides. Yep, it's all very normal, lol.
<br>
<br>
The heart centre is particularly weird (which is why I like it so much) I set it off for fun about once a week.
<br>
<br>
As for guides, these can take many forms. The old mystical texts tend to detail all manner of blurb. But my advice is to get out there and see for yourself.
<br>
<br>
I came across two very interesting people who have helped me a lot. They are not specifically "my guides" as such. One is a different focus who actually sought me out. He is physical within another timeline and he projects to see me. The other person is a bit of a mystery, though she has always maintained that my attempts to find out the origin of our association would be an interesting path for me to follow.
<br>
<br>
Knightlight sounds like he's found an interesting chap. That's a typical example of what I mean. Just keep an open mind and see who makes your acquaintance. Oh, knightlight, you say you have not gone beyond Focus 2, but the meeting at the person's house you describe was a typical Focus 3 experience. Ha ha, yes, maybe next time maybe play it a little cooler, lol. But the place you were whisked off to was, I would say, Focus 3 of consciousness. So an interesting avenue to explore I would say.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
