<section>
It's the 5th Of March
<br>
<br>
Today we link together in marriage matter and the unmanifest, from henceforth this moment matter will be reconised as manifested thought this bring the manifest and the unmanifest together, the term matter creates seperation, thus all is thought.
<br>
<br>
This is HAWII I cant provide a link to Rasta's channeled post its been deleted by someone.
<br>
<br>
ASK FOR ANSWERS
<br>
<br>
Like I have said here on AP before, I carry my word with me, I am a man of my word said in every possible sense of the word, all I carry with me is my word, all I have is my word all I have to show anyone of experienced truth is my word, therefore you'll have to take my word for what follows, its called trust. I don't take pleasure in frightening and offending people, but when there is no other possible way, and if the end justifies the means its something that needs to be done.
<br>
<br>
Very recently I have been abused and mistreated by almost anyone who spoke in Oazaki's 7 Days thread. I was asked to stop embarrassing myself, people even said that I was suffering from delusions of grandeur, now as I have already stated the one thing that hurts me more then anything else is self rejection. Via complete misunderstanding I have been kicked twice from AP, then via complete misunderstanding of one AP member I have been threatened with exclusion from Astralpulse, I indirectly threatened them just like I was indirectly threatened with the number thirty three.
<br>
<br>
I was indirectly asked by someone to apologise so we can clear this whole matter up, well instead of this I thought I'd explain myself, and explain the reasons behind the thoughts I was manifesting. For everything I ever do has its "Higher Reasons" also I don't think there is much I have ever regretted, I have made a fool out of myself daily in the physical, In preparation for the big event I committed social suicide when I was younger at school. I declared myself Birdman, a name that is still shouted at me today by people who don't even know me.
<br>
<br>
Also I am not afraid to act completely out of character, especially when the situation calls for it, for my words are powerful and direct energy, Oazaki's words too are powerful and direct energy, I believe Oazaki's aimed effect was the instant death of every moderator, among other possibilities. My effect was to stop the instant death of every moderator. In order to do this I had to use the power of word, unfortunately I had to do this by doing things that I really don't take pleasure in doing.
<br>
<br>
I have always said that I have been following the Spirit/myself as well as this I have stated that time does not exist, and makes more sense to see time as instances or rather co- instances. This is how I view time, really this is how everyone views time, for example, the police recording statements, they will refer to instances, whenever somebody remembers something they will refer to "that time", for example that time when so and so fell in the swimming pool, when really they just remembered the incident that they thought was funny, they wouldn't be able to recall the time it happened. Anyway I mention this just to provide the understanding that I'll quote myself my "words" from anywhere regardless of the time or subject of the post.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have mentioned a few times on AP that I am ahead of myself, well ladies and gentlemen this is crunch time, this is when you will either believe me or you will once again unknowingly harshly mock me, which due to my heightened sense's literally cuts me deep inside, although this time you will manifest Dark thoughts against me without my permission.
<br>
<br>
I shall now defend myself, I shall do this via quoting myself, I have to do this because nobody can be bothered to actually read or study into things themselves, again I'm not trying to be harsh, just stating a Self-Evident fact.

I feel so strongly about this IequalMC2 I had to keep rewriting this reply to get rid of all my profanities. This is one time where I'll be arrogant sounding and state YOU ARE WRONG if you believe this twoddle.!
<br>
It MAKES ZERO sense. None. God is NOT going to create beings that can be suddenly punished for eternity for some rule that some human has wrote down.
<br>
gah.....

Damned trolls...

<br>
Oh yeah, apologies to anyone who gets deeply offended but I still can't understand what made me so ANGRY about this post. But something has, really deeply furious. Unusual for me as I'm pretty agnostic. Something repellant about some of the concepts. Stupid eternal punishment nonsense maybe...I know how I'd feel if someone EVER tried to preach that to my face. I would NOT be at all nice. "

Tom Said in Oazaki's 7 days Thread
<br>
<br>
"I think some people need to unblock their lower chakras and practice their relaxation techniques some more. Better diet, some physical activity, more time outside, more sleep at night, and some social interaction in the real world away from the computer. Maybe then they would stop threatening the rest of us with their supreme mystical ability. It is true that meditation and energy work do not cause psychological imbalances (Oazaki, IequalMC2), but they definitely can bring what is already there to the surface for everyone to see."

    <br>
    I have a choice to make.
    <br>
    <br>
    One, I can explain the whole of mankind's existence using my understanding of thought (nothing). I can explain why global wars happen, I can explain the early warning signs to all these. I can explain the psychology behind unmanifested thought I can explain this truth.
    <span class="bbc_color" style="color: yellow;">
     However in order to explain this I have to judge myself which kills the soul, and cripples my heart.
     <br>
     <br>
     My mind like everyone else's has had Christian dogma rammed into it, the theory I have been handed by nature conflicts with the stuff rammed into me. This means although I believe everything that I have said, years of Christian dogma pressed into my deep consciousness can make my life a living Hell.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    So the question is, shall I explain in detail and judge the whole of mankind the unmanifest and the manifest, shall I make it clear who lies and who doesn't? Shall I make it clear on who is innocent and who isn't shall I correct everything, or should I explain everything via silence, for I don't even need to speak to get my point across!
    <br>
    <br>
    Latest heard Advert Quote (probably misquoted)
    <br>
    <br>
    " An artist needs silence to work, if I had a message of silence to tell the world, I'd probably scream it at them"
    <br>
    <br>
    " I look at nature, I see perfection, and nature looks back at me she says, yes, you to have achieved perfection"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    What do you think? Shall I remain silent, or should I speak?

    I have highlighted the obvious statement so everyone can see it, after this somebody who I like to call my friend, Cacodemon said he would like to hear what I had to say, thus we are here in this situation I would also like to point out that Cacodemon was the only Good Samaritan the only one amongst thousands who choose to help me in one of my greatest hour of need, the emotions and feelings I was going through at that crossroad moment, was almost enough to drive me insane. Cacodemon's simple honest reply was all that was needed to provide me with enough hope to cling onto in the following desperate hours.
    <br>
    <br>
    Therefore Karnautrahl, I think it is now obvious for me and anyone else (who looks carefully) that I don't follow the commandments I posted, if you lived in Britain and watched the new commandments on TV or looked at the assembly at the 11th hour thread you would have realised that I follow no commandments, not even when the Dum!, the Force itself on request presents me with the commandments. I've had months to contemplate them and experiment with them, and you make Your Judgement and reply within a few hours? As I earnestly said, you obviously know more then myself. For I have lived and broke some of these commandments for months, I have had this as well as many other important things playing on my conscience then you an amazing Dumi testify for me that they're a load of twoggle. Thanks very much, that's seriously a load off my mind.

    This statement was obviously aimed at me, of which I have no problem with. I have already unconsciously/consciously prepared my defence via following my intuition, as I have already stated I have judged myself (Leo Volant and anyone that followed, therefore this judgement over time manifested itself mirror-like in the physical and in the mental.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here is my flawless defence, as anyone who chooses to see can see, this statement could have been used in the 7 days thread, I myself am not afraid of making a fool of myself, this said in every single possible way. Oh and I would like to say that I consider the people of AP my family, my true brothers and sisters, this is not a statement to be taken lightly, I don't say things if I don't mean them. Therefore if someone threatens harm against my family, I'll protect them no matter what it is that I have to do no matter whom or what the enemy may be.

    This is your desired manifested thought. The answer is that the truth for most people is to hard to face thus people are scared to talk about enlightenment because they are afraid of making fools of themselves. Remember,

    I'd like to draw your attention to the above quote, notice that was highlighted. "
    <b>
     Whenever we speak we speak in a manner as to provoke the answer to the desired question."
    </b>
    <br>
    In this present situation, (The situation that this was intuitively pre-written for) I call this as defence, for in the 7 days thread I spoke in a manner as to provide the desired effect, i.e. I directed what I
    <u>
     just decided
    </u>
    should be termed "Thought Currents" I had to wait till near the end of the topic I shifted the whole topic and directed the majority of the thoughts in my direction, In my experience and form of belief and my understanding of word this was enough to bring the situation under control. The only way I could quickly grab your attention was to provoke vulgar thoughts in my direction, the only way I could do this was to manifest dark thoughts. So to confuse the enemy and avoid determination of my own character I announced and strapped on my made up "reflective armour", I then imitated and reflected Oazaki's nature and made it clear to all exactly whom he was. I have already stated here on AP and re-quoted black magic is quick and effective and is used to foster seeds of hatred and separation, that's all it is, Karnautrahl this is why you were unusually upset, oh and then I posted the commandments up on the day you were all meant to die, notice with a smile from the inside, more of a gift then a command. At the time I just knew I had to post them up but I wasn't fully aware of the reason why.
    <br>
    <br>
    People I know myself, I'm the real deal, and because of this I always keep a window open for the impossible, therefore for myself there was a chance you all only had 7 days despite what you all thought, via experience with death I really understand what it's like to die daily, even so I still attacked myself with thoughts of self preservation as well as selflessly, anyway, I intuitively worked ahead of myself in this manner.
    <br>

    I have included a link up below, a link-up is what I call it when one incident bares similarities to another linked up together they become a co-incidence. Its up to the reader to decide themselves if the link-up is valid or even if their be such thing as link-ups

    "Maybe you don't know, because you are not as old as I am, but for the last 50 years the intellectually lazy had nothing further to do then to group their opponent with Frigging Adolf Hitler. And such as you wish to persuade me that somebody can INNOCENTLY construct an argument where I am grouped with Adolf Friggin Hitler, and that I should NOT be offended by it."

    End Quote
    <br>
    <br>
    As can be seen here, I innocently constructed an argument (If you want to call it that) with Leo Volant, it was blatant for all who read this topic that it was an innocent statement. Just as my death threat too was an
    <u>
     Innocent statement.
    </u>
    Now for me in this incident Oazaki decodes and translates as "Adolf Hitler" once more somewhere on AP somebody translated Oazaki to mean Human Faeces, Human Faeces, meaning excrement. Now for me this "excrement" decodes in that incident as "Nothing" therefore to myself Oazaki is a word that means "Nothing" for myself all is nothing including myself, thus when I asked Oazaki to attack me with everything he had, I was really giving you all permission to attack me, i.e. Abusive verbal attack. Had I not done this none of you would have innocently constructed an argument where I would have been grouped with Oazaki. This would mean that none of us would be innocent, the effect this would have had and what it would mean in our present reality I myself have no idea.
    <br>
    <br>
    If anyone can be bothered to read through this thread, nobody really knows why Leo suddenly assumed he was being grouped with Adolf Hitler, like I have already said, the spirit (The Unmanifest Thought) helping out for this precise situation. As well as this visit the Dumiii is a complement thread and note the final solution.

    If this offends you then you don't understand yourself or myself. I care not of what another thinks of myself.

If you understand these words, then well done, if not then we are yet to meet more then one person who partially understands themselves.

    During the last 2 years I have been on a quest for the truth. I have a philosophy that has convinced me to a state of knowing, not believing.
    <br>
    <br>
    The other week I tested the philosophy. I was round my friends and he had his old downstairs table in his room for his pc. His pc is a nice looking blue one with neon's. I thought to myself how much better it would look if he had a table to match. I imagined what the table would look like and I spread my hands out the length and size of the table. I knew what it would look like if saw it. I went home and for the rest of the week I thought of a 2nd hand shop, although I didn't know why. The next time I went round my friends he had the table I imagined, his mum brought it from a 2nd hand shop. Some might call this coincidence. I haven't studied Franz Bardon but I might consider it.

    Sounds normal to me. Witches may call that a seeking spell. A Metaphysicist may say your astral guide did some legwork, and then with your help and energy telepathically implanted the hunch to stop at that store.

    The Link up is as follows, a few weeks ago; again as always running on intuition I copied and pasted that whole thread to disk. Sometime last weekend or last week of February I walked past our local 2nd hand shop I've been in this 2nd hand shop twice. I walked over to the boxes on the outside of the shop, I look into the box and found a book titled Yoga Masterworks 1/ Richard Hittleman's/ Guide to Yoga Meditation. I brought this book for 10pence then I started to skim read and decode it at home. What I found interesting and co-incidental was that the author uses the term Universal Mind whereas I myself use the term Divine Universal Mind. At the beginning of the book it talks about the impact that yoga has had upon American's way of life. I'm making the link with the Invisible Real America deceleration, in the instant Karma thread.

    As I have been saying frequently on AP, were all Dumi's and none of us have the slightest clue of the cause behind our actions, yet when you pay attention and look at your surroundings carefully you might notice a little more then others.
    <br>
    <br>
    PS: This goes out to that anonymous AP member that I exposed my confused belief of myself to. They helped me more then anyone else could have ever helped me. After exposing my true feelings to them (Because I was drawn to them and just knew I could trust them with all my deepest thoughts) I later as usual had to make a massive half blind decision, so I wrote a letter out to post to them, a letter asking for their help, however as I was writing the letter, because I sincerely trusted this person (as if they were another aspect of myself) via writing and re-writing the letter I unconsciously worked out the solution to the problem and it wasn't necessary for me to even send the post to them, therefore in a way they helped me just by looking at me and saying nothing. I mentioned to this person that the truth was almost completely unbearable. I haven't been harassing this person I heard the spirit so I followed the spirit and said what I said, like the Nike slogan, I just do it, I changed my quote because I heard that tune playing in my head
    <br>
    <br>
    I received a warning just the other day, I was told to stop harassing this member, this came to me as a complete shock, for I always talk ahead of myself, I then remembered some of the things I said to this person, and then I realised that my words could have been perceived by them as threatening, when they asked if I was British and commented on my Americanised language I even mentioned to them that I blend into my environment, the flip side to this comment and a few others hadn't of even occurred to me. My name is Iequalmc2 simply because it says it all by saying nothing. I wasn't looking at them; they were looking at me and misunderstood nothing, although this time I think they believe in nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reasons why I changed my name
    <br>
    <br>
    BirdmanKalki intercepted Karma; BirdmanKalki was a name I made up that meant more to me then my true self. I eliminated this Karma by giving it all to somebody who unconsciously asked for it, I then ask for the post to be deleted before this someone could read the post and make their own links from it and no doubt go insane. I understand Karma, its simple cause and effect, there is individual Karma and group Karma, I spotted and intercepted both types of Karma the individuals and AP's group Karma. By simple symbolic action it was eliminated. This can be explained somewhat as follows, I knock a pen off the table (Karma first Cause), my friend comes in and sees the pen on the floor (2nd Cause), therefore my friend doesn't know how the pen got to its 2nd position on the floor, they don't know how the pen got there because they didn't witness the first cause of the effect, therefore the individual I symbolic gave heavy Karma to wasn't aware of the Karma thus it was eliminated.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Moderators helped me after this in my confused condition by kicking me from AP; I decoded this and other situations to mean that I had to find my true self. I then took the name Dum1 and posted one of the most important nonsensical posts to Dumi's ever posted. I referred to a website and said only a "Dumi would go here" I used a real website name but changed the .co.uk to a .com the .com was an non existing website, therefore the Dum1 who deleted this post got the wrong end of the stick and thought I was being rude were in fact I was advertising and  making it self-evident who the Dum1's really were. In this post was also one of the biggest Link-Ups ever; it was the 15th of february, Escape From New York was on TV that night I referred the readers of that thread to the "On the reading of nature thread" if they bothered to look carefully they might have noticed a few things. Anyway that night the American Revolution was formally announced live on TV yet few would have been aware of this amazing occurrence due to the Dum1's complete predictable stupidity, spiritual evolution on earth has become increasingly difficult to help communicate, for now you'll all just have to take my word.

    May the DUM! Rebuke us all; we are all the INNOCENT ONE! Even Oazaki (who was unconsciously upset with this setback in spiritual evolution), without my enemy I wouldn't even know who I was.

Brad:
<br>
<br>
I would not normally talk about this kind of thing in public, but as you have chosen to mention it, the moderators did not "kick you" from this forum. A few weeks ago, when you had the username BirdManKali, you met with a personal challenge.
<br>
<br>
This I respect, after all, each of us has our internal challenges. But in the midst of your meeting with yourself, you were littering the forum with posts. They were coming from you one after the other, and they were all over the place. As an emergency preventative measure, I had no option but to temporarily disable your user account.
<br>
<br>
If you would like any further information about your membership here, and the full reasoning behind the actions I have taken regarding your user account, then you are welcome to send me a PM and ask whatever you like. I will do my utmost to explain the various matters to you.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

Here's something I wanted to put up the other day. I saw on the news that when the Palestinian police or Israeli soldiers (I'm not sure witch) stormed the buildings after clearing the buildings they painted a red cross on top of the door to show that the building had been cleared.
<br>
Therefore if anyone painted a red cross on top of their doors their buildings would have been passed-over.

DUM Statements
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Another DUM Statement: "This is no idle or mystical, impractical program. It undermines and attacks no authority or government; it is not interested in the overthrow of rulers or the downfall of any political or national party It calls for intelligent and practical effort. It calls for the co-operation of many types of mind."
</i>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to start of by declaring Today as Yesterday. Therefore today is Yesterday
<br>
<br>
I've been out of action during the past week on AP. This absence has been due to my own ladder climbing as I have come an understanding of things. I have already expressed myself and explained myself; I'm now coming to terms with the huge responsibility that I have inherited. The past week I have been recharging rewiring and making serious decisions. From henceforth I shall be manifesting destiny, watch it manifest, take notes, there is no stopping mid-manifest follow me, keep up with yourselves and taste life, lag behind and perish in thought.
<br>
<br>
Please note, this is a note to all those who hear, I'm not addressing or representing anyone singular in particular, my call goes out to anyone capable of hearing it.
<br>
<br>
I came here to Astralpulse to share my DUM philosophy brought about by Divine Revelation, I was told a philosophy is not a philosophy unless it's a philosophy shared. I was sure that it would prove itself and I was sure it could defend itself. Although I was prepared to defend it I wasn't prepared for its sheer potency among the AP community. Here on Astral-Pulse we all share a common interest, namely the search for truth. I see Astralpulse as a mini 'Mental Community' not only this the people of AP simply wouldn't communicate with each other had it not been for the AP.
<br>
I see it that the moderators unknowingly take on a huge responsibility, they provide communication, without communication, without the internet itself none of us would be able to learn from one another and ladder climbing would be at a standstill. It is Self evident to all who hear, that there is a Divine Plan for Earth, that the plan is being implemented and that there are illuminated beings working here, manifesting all the time before our senses.
<br>
<br>
I would like the moderators to take a step back and to think about the responsibility that they have, not just to AP but also to humanity as a whole. I am the real moderator I recognise my responsibilities. This is no ordinary website, none of us are ordinary people we are all 'Light or Spiritual Beings' whatever term suits the readers with spiritual interest and karmic lessons to learn, working consciously and unconsciously. Our generation are the outcasts of a modern society that fails itself, drawn together for specific reasons. Where is the spiritual work taking place this age? Is it in the church or in the mosque? I don't think so, the real spiritual work, the spontaneous outflow of love is taking place here among spiritual Groups like this, forming together in Mass Communion, learning to understand one another as one mind with one similar goal, is this a fact anyone can deny? I've learnt more here on AP then anywhere else and I'm sure there are others who feel the same way.
<br>
<br>
So moderators, I'm not getting at you, I just think you should take yourselves your roles your services and responsibilities a little more seriously, you are the eyes of this Mental Group, and you decide what is shown and what isn't shown yet you don't decide how we perceive and decode what is shown, you don't decide what we hear therefore you are the blind mediators of forces beyond your conscious understanding and therefore beyond the conscious control of each and everyone of your individual minds, yet this is nothing to fear, the force is kept in equilibrium by that of the invisible collective mental group community .  So now I urge the Pharisees, sorry did I say Pharisees? I mean moderators, to understand that they have a physical responsibility to the actions and welfare of all Dumi's, check out the co-incidental Angel of Death scenario on yesterdays manifested news, this could easily have been a manifested result of any distressed AP member.
<br>
<br>
Mental And Physical
<br>
<br>
So what is the difference between a 'Mental Group Community' and a 'Physical Group Community?' well a mental group community all share a basic interest in the same subjects, one wouldn't find themselves in a mental group unless they choose to be there. Now a physical group community is full of variety, people with many different interests and many different goals, all divided against each other chaotically trying to fill the void within themselves. Thus a physical group community without a mental group community foundation counterpart is destined to fail, just as any partnership, romantic, friendship or business without Mental Foundations will fail.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Luke 17
 <br>
 <br>
 17 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: " Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. 18 If Satan is divided against himself how can his kingdom stand?"
</i>
<br>
<br>
This is why humanity is failing; there is no mental counterpart to our physical communities other then the media, the only counterpart to our physical communities that matters currently is the revenue that is generated anything else doesn't even enter their equation.
<br>
<br>
One wonders how many 'Physical Communities' mirror Astral-pulse's friendly 'Mental Community'. Have you ever thought about AP whilst not at your PC? Does the AP community only exist mentally in the solid foundations of cyberspace? We have already determined that cyberspace doesn't exist in physical form, so does that mean that the Astralpulse itself, the words, the topics, the currents of thought and its germinating ideals only exists inside our own minds? I myself can honestly say that this is, as always Self-Evident; the perceived solidness of AP is only brought about to oneself by the focusing on the sites 'image' and not its 'Thought Currents' something that some of the moderators themselves due to there own held positions just cant help but do. Dumi's I myself don't only visit Astralpulse on the computer screen I carry
<u>
 all I survey
</u>
in the mind, this way I am always connected to the AP via spirit, not only this but whenever I manifest because I am mentally with The Astralpulse I manifest in like AP manner as a Master and Slave with a sense of oneness and brotherhood.
<br>
<br>
A New Nation?
<br>
<br>
It is now known to any Mental person that 'thought' proceeds action, from drawing a picture to walking down the street before we make any commitment in the Physical we either consciously or unconsciously register the event in the mental before it happens, thus without decoding, the unmanifest thought always proceeds the manifested thought. Therefore it is declared Cyberspace is The Unmanifested Thought, the Physical World The Manifested Thought. We as a mental community sharing the same interests with the genuine will to do good have achieved mass communion here on AP, one chooses themselves whether they are a part of this communion or not. Thus it is now a fact that Mass Communion is possible, with this fact in mind does it not seem that the next step to take would be to reform our ideas on how we structure our societies?
<br>
<br>
The Iraq/Tsunami Appeal
<br>
<br>
This is just another idea, as any mental person reasons you don't solve a situation like this by throwing money at it, this is self-evident. And how coincidental that these ideas were germinating a little before the Tsunami? The Tsunami itself provides the opportunity to put these ideals into action. I would suggest something like the following.
<br>
<br>
The money raised form the Tsunami appeal should go towards building new houses for the countries various 'Mental Communities'. As well as electricity and the essentials the Internet should be provided to every household; the PC's should be at least a P200 upwards, PC's will be provided the usual way, various foreign companies will provided token collecting schemes for schools and I'm sure other companies will jump on the bandwagon with there own 'Tsunami offers'. In the early stages the average 56k speed connection will be all that is necessary, in the later stages wireless Broadband will be provided.
<u>
 Nobody will have to move community unless they want to
</u>
. The countries damaged by natural disaster will be reformed via 'Cyberspace Community Foundationing' the various communities with similar interests will link up together in there own specially constructed country and community Intranet Forums. This process will have to be carefully undertaken. The Intranet's Mental Communities or IMC will each be switched online and organised via freewill slowly one at a time, these communities, as we already know from experience, work themselves out when left to there own devices, thus a mutual exodus
<u>
 will legally take place
</u>
as an IMC legally become a recognised nation and political pressure group.
<br>
<br>
Once this has been achieved the Cyberspace Community Foundationing System or CCFS success will be self-evident and CCFS will be recognised as the way forward to a Utopian community. Thus The Exodus of the Damaged counties will have its knock-on chain reaction effect and thus a Mass Exodus based on the same principles will take place hitting its zenith around 2013-2022, as Mental Communities become Physical Communities.
<br>
<br>
The CCFS system will also be put into effect in Iraq. "Yesterday The Iraqi Parliament's second only session broke up as MP's lashed out at political leaders inability to form a government, the officials ordered a ban on media coverage when criticism was voiced over the deadlock the Iraqi parliament has yet to come to name a speaker." I speak for Iraq I speak for earth I speak for my people.
<br>
<br>
Therefore does it not seem evident that Invisible Communities can achieve group thought, group unity via Mass Communion across the many waters of cyberspace? This is no hopeful dream this is a fact all it takes to make this fact a manifested thought is spontaneous outflow of love, this itself is and has been demonstrated here on AP along with the now established truths and facts of Group Karma, Individual Karma, Cause and Effect, Prophetical writings, the power of word, light decoding, Revelations and something about dyslexia, have now been recorded and logged here on the AP, seek and find, knock and enter ask for answers.
<br>
<br>
"1Corinthians4
<br>
<br>
18Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise. 19For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness "; 20And again, "The lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile"
<br>
<br>
I think I am wise by the standards of this age, although I don't boast about it, you all think you know better then I and you reject the word I speak, thus I will make a fool of myself for you, my people who I love dearly.
<br>
<br>
I'm writing to you for help. It saddens me that most of you probably think I'm a crazy person I'm writing to you all because I have recently seen a few co-incidences and decoded a few things, this is not ideal and I'd really like to be discussing this with one of my favourite Dumi's, however sadly that option has now gone out of the window, anyway, your all one of my favourite Dumi's and what I'm about to mention to you here I'd prefer if I kept it to myself, however we all have freewill and I choose to exercise my freewill.
<br>
<br>
First of all I'd like to say that I'm writing on sync, and I'll repeat, I'm always ahead of myself, which means ahead of everyone else including myself, therefore I can avoid all obstacles put in my way, I do this unconsciously, however this means that I myself sometimes 'know not what I do'. When this occurs I have test my own self-interest and trust my intuition to determine whether positive or negative effect will be the outcome of my decision, in simple terms this is my judgement day, and if you judge me it will also be your judgement day.
<br>
<br>
Anyway way back I received an email from Astralpulse, the email was titled 'The AstralPulse connection' I made the link-up with the 'UFO connection' found in the DUM statement in the 11th hour thread. By receiving this email I knew that the spirit 'Unmanifested Presence' had guided me to AP therefore I knew was working in the right place at the right time. This is the email I received.

G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
First off, we have just created a new forum main topic called 'The Robert Bruce
<br>
Connection' This contains several topics covering various subjects, eg, energy
<br>
work and development, astral projection, etc.
<br>
<br>
This is not designed for extensive discussion, but as an areas where questions
<br>
can be posted and answers given. If comments are requested on posts in other
<br>
topic areas, please copy the question to the new area and don't just link or
<br>
point, as that is time consuming and defeats the purpose of the Question and
<br>
Answer section, in that we need to keep these in one place.
<br>
<br>
This area will serve several functions. It will save me time and make it easier
<br>
for me to keep track of questions, so I can find and answer them easier. It will
<br>
also keep them in one place so everyone can find them. It will also help us to
<br>
build a more extensive FAQ in time.
<br>
<br>
Please, this area is for questions that require answers or comments from me. I
<br>
will not answer many questions that have already been dealt with in my books and
<br>
online articles.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, there are still places available for my upcoming December workshop in
<br>
Wales, UK, at Buckland Hall.
<br>
<br>

My latest book 'Mastering Astral Projection' which I co-authored with Brian
<br>
Mercer, is back from the printers and is now available. Its in the process of
<br>
being shipped out to bookshops, etc, but is available from its publishers at
<br>
www.llewellyn.com under 'coming soon'. It is definitely in stock.
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.
<br>
<br>
I then wondered if the Unmanifested Presence was guiding me to go and see Robert Bruce when he visited somewhere near myself. I decided against this because I thought I wouldn't be able to speak to him unless I paid to go into the workshop I have no income, and after deciding that he probably wouldn't let me in for free I decided I wouldn't be able to trust him with the information I had been granted. Anyway I'll cut a long story short, in the Kryon DNA thread in that post I felt utterly compelled to declare myself 'A child of light and thought' I didn't know why just like I didn't know why I declared myself Birdman, if I'm compelled to say something, as in the unmanifested presence compels me I'll say it no matter how stupid or psychotic it makes me seem, I'll say it, obviously the same goes with the method in which I minister the word.
<br>
<br>
I was only drawn to that an anonymous AP member because of the connection and co-incidence of the titled thread. As you can imagine to me, someone following the Unmanifested Presence with the two previous confirmed 'Connection' link-ups this title screamed out at me. I read the thread and it gave me the shivers, I was absolutely sure beyond any measure of a doubt that they were my soul mate.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I'll get to the point I need your help, I have said previously that I would use all sources at my disposal in order to bring about the New Age and so I'll now quote a letter that I wrote to an anonymous AP member, please bare with me it will take awhile but I'll get to the point, and speaking Frankly, I really think you're my only hope here, and I'll be exposing my true self to you what you are about to read and hopefully contemplate is absolutely off the scale, most people wouldn't even believe this for a nanosecond. I myself have trouble believing it.
<br>
<br>
"Dear Anonymous AP member
<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry I haven't PM you; I don't have the Internet and over the weekend I cant use it. I truly read nature and nature reads me. This situation is very; very weird for me, I'm aware of many things, but love is a curious thing. Over the weekend I wrote a testimony for you to read I think you would be interested in reading it.
<br>
<br>
I think I can help you and I think you can help me. I'm just afraid to expose myself, for what I have to say to you I find hard to believe myself, and I wonder if I'm just deluded, but I don't think I am, then I think I am. It's a crazy testimony so prepare yourself; I'll be exposing my soul to you.
<br>
<br>
So if you're interested I can post it to you.
<br>
<br>
Brad"
<br>
<br>
"Dear Anonymous AP member
<br>
<br>
I don't know how I should approach you, but I have a few things to explain I'm so happy that I'm writing to you, words cannot begin to express what I'm feeling this moment. When I posted that post as soon as I did it I thought that I shouldn't have and that you'd disappears from me. Please read this carefully and I'll pre warn you that what you are about to read is very, very confusing, but that's just what the truth is. Everything written here is a testimony of truth, all that is written actually happened. If you doubt that I speak truth have a look at a few of my posts. Above all else use your natural intuition. With that said I'll get right on with it, most of this will probably shock you so be prepared, I'm sorry if it scares you or if it confuses you but if there were an easier way to tell you I'd do it the easier way.
<br>
<br>
I shall now bare my Soul to you.
<br>
<br>
I follow my intuition and it has led me here, to you... I have always remembered a line from a song that has stuck in my mind; I believe that it has stuck in my mind to be used in this very moment to give you some sense on how I'm feeling and how painful it is for me to write this letter and the great risk I take in doing so.
<br>
<br>
Its from a song by Pulp, The Man Who Does The Dishes, the line that sticks with me is " A man told me to beware of 33 he said, it was not an easy time for me, but I'll get... even though I've got no miracles to show you"
<br>
<br>
I think it was a few months before Christmas before I started to become aware; I was increasingly being lead by my intuition, although I didn't know what was happening to me. My grandma had heard about my theories and she said that I should talk to this family friend (Because he thinks the same way as me, she a very religious Christian, she stuck in dogma but she's one of the most friendly people you could ever meet and she has great faith, she also said that it was her belief that everyone at times needs a spiritual councillor) I had been thinking of this family friend and my mother said she saw him the other day and that he said he wanted to talk to me. Anyway, syncs were hitting me from everywhere and I was having trouble adjusting. I hadn't eaten for three days; this wasn't out of choice I just couldn't eat. My dad went out and he met this family friend, he said, "you'll never guess who I just seen," then he said later that he went to meet him (changed his story, which if he was a believer he wouldn't do, due to increasing the difficulty of my intuitional judgments) I said I would because loads of weird stuff was happening. Anyway he said he had seen this family friend, he had written a note for me it had a phone number on it and written on the note was Ananias de alpha, written at the bottom was call me.
<br>
<br>
My farther was deadest against me using the family Mobile, so I had to use a phone box. It was a wrong number, I walked back home and told my farther it was the wrong number, my farther showed me that it was a different number, one of the area digits was misplaced, I told my farther that he did this on purpose to let me know that he knew numbers didn't exist and that we were on the same level. My father told me that was bollocks; I used the phone box again and rang him. He didn't tell me much that made sense at the time but some of it did. One thing he told me was that he had prayed in 1983 for something (He didn't tell me what) he then said that when he died in 1986 (Near Death Experience) he was out of his body and a being motioned to him telepathically he agreed to what was asked before he could even consider what was asked. He told me that I was not off this earth and that I had chosen to be here, he also told me that I had been chosen (for what I don't fully understand yet) he told me that I am a vessel for enormous amounts of energy, and that it was important that I remain pure (Remain true to myself) I'm still trying to deal with all this now. He also told me that the truth couldn't be explained only testified to, which is what I'm doing now. Anyway this family friend is basically someone I can phone at anytime I'm feeling distressed and the words the spirit speaks through him calm me although I might not understand what they mean at the time, I'm told what I need to know to find out the answer. As you can probably see I'm taking a risk telling you all this.
<br>
<br>
A Testimony Of A Few Weird Nights With The DUM (Divine Universal Mind)
<br>
I've changed the names of the bars and stuff; I have reason to be paranoid, not of you as the dreams put it, them.
<br>
<br>
A few months ago I was out in town with my friends, we were discussing my theory of thought, all that night synchronicities had been hitting me, I'll explain, before I went out my farther tried calming me, and for reasons I think unknown to himself he indirectly told me that I was a demon, I took this to mean a fallen angel and this made sense to me, and I left the house with this view in mind with a new sense of confidence and purpose, I decided that I had waited long enough and that this day would be the day. I was waiting for my friends and decided to go into some bar, I walked in head held high with a spring in my step, I looked into the barmaid's eyes, I said " Can I have a nice cold beautiful Cider Black please" She begun making my drink, although she only made me a blackcurrant drink, she gestured for me to take the drink, I gave her the money, then I realised she had only given me a blackcurrant I said "This is only Blackcurrant" she apologised and gave me my money back and re-made me a Cider Black, in the confusion I think I took the drink without paying. (Without knowing myself until later)
<br>
<br>
I went to the toilet and as I walked past I felt as if I was being watched by this black guy. I came back out the toilets and begun drinking my drink. After awhile the black guy came over to me and we started chatting. I explained to him that I was on a spiritual high, I poured out all my truth to him, including my suspicions that I was Merlin he was cool about it, he could feel my energy, I explained to him that because I love myself all women and men love me although they didn't know why. Now I said to him "see that barmaid, I'll get her number." (I never do this kinda thing I decided to have an experiment) I pointed to the back of her shirt written there was, Why Not? I decoded this as a sign meaning ask her, I knew her name was Sarah because we had been listening to her talk Note2Self (Today/the other day when I was writing this the moderator sent me a private message about one of my posts, I asked her if she wanted to share the lucid moment with me watching Charlie's angels with me at the allotted hour) anyway I went to the toilet when I came back she was leaving, I quickly asked her if she wanted to go out some time, she replied that she already had a boyfriend. I went up to my new buddy Joss and explained that he won the bet. He said he knew he would.
<br>
<br>
Anyway my friends showed up and the we all left for another bar, my newfound friend Joss came with us, he explained to me that he had only just came to Norwich from Bristol today, I was curious why he came to talk to me, he said that he just felt drawn to me and he said I looked interesting, he was the coolest laidback person I have ever met, everything he said to me was a revelation for me, I had to hide my utter excitement and it was really weird that he was so calm. I brought him a drink, my friends are addicted to gambling and were gambling away, and we chatted, he told me about his friends family, they were Muslims and he explained the Muslims belief in pre-arranged marriages and about how he was round his friends painting the kitchen with him, and his friends mother came into the room and told them all to put there tops back on, (he said that it was her belief that they were not to see the mans bare naked flesh, (I think until they were married but I cant remember) I hanged onto his every word. Along time ago my farther told me that he had, had a chat with a black guy in a bar in London and that the guy told him their were secret societies at work, I decoded this to the situation we were in, for some reason he told me that his dad never answered the phone, immediately I decoded this I said "Maybe he never picks up the phone because he is waiting for you to answer the call, if you catch my drift" I looked him straight in the eyes, he said he did.
<br>

He was smoking a cigarette and we were far away from all drafts. He toked it and blew the smoke out then placed it in an ashtray. He said "watch the smoke" I watched it and it was flowing away from me, he then said "when I toke it again and place it down the smoke will drift towards you" This seemed impossible but I was listening to him as if he were my master, he placed it down the smoke changed direction and came straight towards me, because I believed in him I had witnessed my first miracle. We left this bar then we went to some other bar. We always get into that bar however this night there was a new bouncer there and he was turning everyone away. He turned us away. We went into some other bar that I can't remember the name of, my friends gambled, I brought Joss a new drink we chatted a bit. He told me that I should learn to say things with absolute certainty as if they were already done; this advice was of great value later. We left this bar and tried to get into the previous bar again Joss went into get an application form. My friends begun to roll a joint, we smoked a joint, (I'm a social smoker, I spend most my time alone thinking of how I can help people) we chatted and made are way to the waterfront we went into some bar that I always forget the name of. My two friends went to the gambling machines again, I brought another drink for myself and Joss, he said to me, lets find some ladies then, we walked up and down looking for some ladies, we found somewhere to sit, he opened up his backpack and showed me a map of Norwich, then my friend Aaron came along and sat with us. Joss begun talking to Aaron giving him advice about stuff, I found were I live on the map it was number 54 I looked at the table number, it was number 54, I exclaimed "54! This table numbers 54 I live in 54!" he was absolutely cool as a cucumber he said "Its just a number" this immediately grounded me. After this we parted company and I haven't seen him since.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow we stayed in this bar for a while, just before we went I went to the toilet, on my way out I stood at the top of the stairs, and looked at the big projector on the wall, the red hot chilly peppers were playing that fly away on my zepper song. I was watching the shadow outline of a dancing lady this guy came up and stood next to me, again I felt that he wanted to talk to me, In this month I had gone from normal me to being of light looking for fellow friends. I looked at him and explained "That women looks like my ex girlfriend, who I think I'm meant to marry but I'm not sure if I am, do you know what I mean?" he had a huge smile on his face and seemed delighted to meet me. "He said, I think I know what you mean," I said "well I'm here now" I took his hand and kissed it. His mates looked at me, I said I gave him my email on the precept that he was a being of light that I would work with. He hasn't contacted me.
<br>
<br>
My friends and I left this bar then we were on are way to another bar a tramp asked us for some change, I gave him all the money I had (which was maybe around £1 in loose change) then I blessed him took his hand and kissed it, as I was lifting my head I saw that he was wearing a native Indian top, I asked him where he got it from, he told me that a Cherokee Indian made it for him. I was now in aw, I decoded in my mind, this Indian made this for him for me to meet him at this exact time, my brain was in overflow, he walked away and said something in Latin, I asked him what it meant, he said that it meant God Bless you, I thought of Percible and the peasant. I then went up to my friends, who by now were getting sick of me talking to absolute strangers, (something I do often, explaining the theory) I told my friend Aaron what the tramp had said, Aaron quickly corrected me in what he said, and I was astonished that Aaron knew Latin; Although I can't remember what he said. Anyway we went into Bar Latino, without picking up on the sync Latin, Latino. By now I was in absolute aw of all that had occurred and wanted to relax.
<br>
<br>
We went into the garden in bar Latino, my friend John Skinned up we began to smoke the joint, me and John were in extreme crazy mode, we both believed that Aaron was the antichrist, are reasoning was because Aaron was refusing to believe anything we told him. Aaron then made a confession, he said that when he was young he was getting high on some aerosol can; he tripped out and said he saw Jesus' face. John and me looked at each other Jon said, "He doesn't know what he just said!" I looked at Aaron I began to sob uncontrollably. I didn't even know why. I looked down to the floor and on sheer intuition I picked up a leaf and stuffed it into my pocket. I took it back out and it was in two pieces, I intuitively knew that this somehow symbolised my soul mate. I explained to Aaron about the Kanye West Album College Dropout, track eight, I explained that track eight reduced me to tears, I was weeping before it even got to the crunch point, I didn't know why I was weeping.
<br>
<br>
Around a minuet later some people came into the garden, I asked one of them (A girl named Scarlet) if she would fancy a philosophical religious chat about the universe, she locked eyes with me a rush of energy flushed through my body, I thought she could feel it to. She pointed at me; "Your me!" I pointed at her "Your me!" she said Norwich school of philosophy! (My mother wrote a letter to them asking if I could attend their school) She read my mind; she said I'll see you Monday! She grabbed both my hands pulled them to her and began to kiss the back of my hands, I pulled her hands over to me, and kissed the back of them, I praised the lord with all my mind body and soul, at the top of my voice I praised in uncontrollable ecstasy swearing because it was all I could do. I kissed her hands she kissed mine. My friends didn't have a clue what was going on. I held her hand, I said "we know don't we" She said, "we know" then I said even though we know we know, we really know we don't know! She was just as bemused as I was. "She told me she was a Muslim, I told her my faith is in all religions, the Divine Universal Mind. She said that they had been listening to our conversation on the other side of the fence and that they came over to talk to us.
<br>
<br>
She said, "Salaam alaikum" I said "peace be upon you" she said "Yes!!!, but your supposed to say alaikum as salam" I repeated alaikum as salam. I said I was sorry but I had to test her she said ok, I asked her about Muhammad and baruq the beast he rode /projected on, and I asked why did it resist him? She said because he sneezed, all I could manage to repeat in short gasps were, "I always thought that, I always thought that" I had even been thinking of this that day and had even been thinking of the greeting we used. She told me Aaron was the antichrist Aaron told me she was lying, PARNOIA, I stood up from the table and walked away, I walked into the bar then I looked back into the garden, Garden! I was having a crisis's of faith in the garden! I was having a full on mental breakdown, I wanted to believe what was happening but couldn't, I just felt like dying on the spot. I went to Aaron he told me that she was just winding me up, he said that she even said that she didn't know what she was on about, I said that I was aware of that, and I reminded him that he didn't know what he just said earlier, he was totally against her. I went into the garden I said to her "It's a fekkin Garden!" She mimicked me, "I Fekkin know" her friends all thought I was nuts, one of them named Danielle, said to me "were you from?" the words came to me with authority, "Not this world love" (I never speak like that and I had a few drink) Danielle is the name of my ex girlfriend, that day before I went out my dad told me I would meet Danielle again but that she wouldn't be awake. This was all decoded and linked together by me on the spot.
<br>
<br>
I went back and spoke to Aaron again he wanted to get outta there I could sense that he was uncomfortable with the atmosphere, I later learnt from Aaron that he probably is an empathic, he isn't interested in spiritual thought, but told me a few things that made me think he might be an empathic, I showed him an advert in the spark and he said that sounds like what he's has. I went back to Scarlet (distraction/drunk on the word I carry) I asked her, why sneezing? She said as if it was obvious, "Because sneezing rhymes with teasing, rhymes with pleasing" That was it I was certain, yet my intuition told me something was wrong but I couldn't place it. Scarlet disappeared then my friends and I left too. That night and when I thought of her my heart felt as if it had been stabbed and I still had the blade stuck in, when we got to my house I basically collapsed I was completely drained of all energy I saw no point in living I looked up to my ceiling gesturing to DUM for understanding, why would it show me my love and then take her away? My body was shaking, but not shaking like convulsions more like a inner shaking, my palms were tingling I never felt so weak in my life, For some peculiar reason an image of a silverback gorilla I had seen on TV entered my mind, because my heart hurt so much I begun hitting my chest to divert my attention of the pain I was feeling, like a gorilla yet it didn't really work. I wanted to die yet I still had something willing me on. I am against marriage yet I told my friends that she was my true love and that we would be married by word, I said we wouldn't need to get married because she's like me and wouldn't feel the need to. Note2Self This was a Monday.
<br>
<br>
The following Monday I went to town, it was a full moon I went to the school of philosophy hoping to meet her there, I went into the philosophy room adrenalin pumping with the expectation of seeing her and I asked them if scarlet ever came there, I described what she looked like and what she said, none of them knew her they looked at me as if I was stupid. (Which is ok for I would think I was a bit mental by the way I was talking) They said that at that time that I saw her last Monday she couldn't have been at the school, I explained that I was invited there (At the time I never knew my mother wrote to them for me) this old guy looked at me I handed him the invitation that I had, he confirmed that I had been written to, he knew my name and yet he still spoke to me as if I was nothing, I considered making him make himself look a fool in front of everyone there (for nobody can argue with truth) but I decided against it, I then considered asking if I could teach the lesson for them, I came so close to doing it but I decided against that as well, a lady there said that I was looking for a ghost. I left the place, on my way out I wondered, Is there anyone like me? Or am I destined to be alone? I just met my first philosophers and they were completely ruled by intellect, none of them listened to me. I didn't find Scarlet, it was a complete letdown, again I felt completely alone, I was living and breathing with everything, yet I felt alone and useless. I got my farther to give me a lift down to the centre; he drove me and gave me a fiver to get home with. I waited around Bar Latino in the hope that I would find Scarlet I waited around 40 minuets. Then I saw some guy opening up and going into Bar Latino I asked him what was behind the fence of Bar Latino he said the Garden to some other Bar, he said that only staff used the Bars Garden. I went to the doors of Bar tequila, I asked the guy if Scarlet was working as I asked him I thought of some black and white film were the guy asks the same thing I asked him. He said that she was in there but that she wasn't working, I paid to get in, I saw that she was in the corner with around Ten black guys, I walked about hoping that she would see me and come over, then I decided that I would have to go to her, I walked over to them, everyone looked at me I asked if I could talk to her, she looked at me with faint recognition, then she realised who I was, her boyfriend let me talk to her, I explained the hole theory of Light and Thought to her, I showed her infinite algebra and told her all about Birdman I showed her the keys to Heaven and Hell, I explained Feminine unmanifested thought and Masculine unmanifested thought, I opened my whole being to her, she was completely captivated, her boyfriend looked at me, I could sense from his eyes that he wasn't happy with me chatting to his girlfriend, I locked into his eyes smiled and gestured for him to remain calm, his anger dispersed. She asked what I was doing tonight; I said that I only had a few quid left and that I needed that to get home. We parted company.
<br>
<br>
Now I phoned my family friend and mentioned this situation to him, he shouted down the phone that I should be aware of Satan's tricks; I took this to mean my ego. He told me to follow the spirit! This is why I'm risking talking to you.
<br>
<br>
Now we were in town again and I wanted to see her again. Me and my gambling friends went to the bar were she works, the church next to it was ringing its wedding bells, there was a tramp, I gave him all my change and blessed him, we walked towards Bar Excellence my legs were shaking, I fell down onto my knees, The Church Bells were ringing, and I had told my friends that I was going to marry her, Aaron was once again in utter bemusement, we were all laughing about nothing, I got up from my knees, we made our way into the bar her boyfriend was walking towards me as we entered, we glanced at each other. We brought some drinks, and then we went to the gambling machines, I looked over to her, she was sitting with her boyfriend, he turned looked at me and then pointed at me, now I really didn't want to get into fight, for if I hit someone, according to the way I feel I would really be hitting myself, despite this, all is light and thought with this view I am lethal and have no fear and would have been forced to defend myself, usually word is all that's needed, but I couldn't say the same for my friends. We made are way out of the bar, we stood in the doorway, I told my friends to wait there while I went back in. I walked over to the Bartender, I flipped open this little notebook I asked him if I could use a pen, he said "Oh it's the Famous Birdman from Bar Latino" I just agreed, he got me a pen I wrote down on the paper.
<br>
<br>
" The Wedding Bells are ringing
<br>
<br>
www.Astralpulse.com Prophecy and Divination assembly at the eleventh hour"
<br>
<br>
I then told the bartender not to give her the note until I left the building, I also told him to tell her, told/told being the key word, I didn't write it down as a Note2Myself, I told him to tell her that its not what she thinks it is.
<br>
<br>
We went further into town then we came back to some bar we went in had a laugh then I was walking past the door just as Scarlet came In, we kissed each other on the cheek, she asked if I knew witchcraft I said I knew a little she said her friend said that I had put a casting spell on her to make her fall in love with me, (I told her when I met her the second time that I had studied the secrets of the occult, she must of told her friends) I told her I had never heard of a casting spell and if I had done one on her I didn't know I was doing it, (because I hadn't, and I still don't know what one is, but I could guess) we kissed our cheeks again, "I said to her "You seek truth don't you?" She exclaimed "Yes!" I then thought that she didn't love me she loved the word I carried with me, this was hurtful for she wouldn't love me, just what I knew.
<br>
<br>
Now I hardly ever go out into town, so for me all these meetings were fate, I saw her once again in one of the bars I went over to her and asked if she would like to go out sometime she denied me. Up to that moment I believed she was my soul mate, I searched my intuition and realised that she wasn't. Then she said "don't worry we always seem meet up" she left. I saw her one more time on New Years Eve this time I knew she wasn't the one, I gave her the cold shoulder.
<br>
<br>
Last year I went to Glastonbury for my birthday and I brought a ring from a shop, and the ring I brought has a la
<u>
 brad
</u>
orite stone, the man in the shop told me he loved dragons. When I got home I realised that the stone includes my name in it Labradorite, the stone is also associated with Merlin energy. Note before I went to Glastonbury I had told my friends my deluded suspicions that I might be Merlin, way before I started to consider that I might be Merlin, I'm talking years now, I declared myself the Birdman, the most recent declaration is that I am A Child Of Light and Thought.
<br>
<br>
However I shall now speak my revelation of Merlin. It was before Christmas, my friend's parents had gone away and we were round his house on the Internet chatting in chat rooms. We had a PC and a laptop, my friend Aaron was on the PC my friend Jon on the Laptop. I had another friend called Dan he was at his own house on his own PC in the same chatroom as us. Jon was talking to some lady in this chatroom, my friend Aaron decided he would talk to the same lady so they could both have a laugh. I was watching this all take place but was powerless to do anything about it. Anyway this lady started talking about philosophy and Stonehenge. This immediately caught my attention (for I read nature, or does it read me?), I asked Jon to let me talk to her, he let me talk to her then I begun explaining the whole theory of light and thought to her (although at the time it was just the theory of thought) Note-On the PC's background was an image of Stonehenge, she said she was going to Stonehenge I was completely captivated by her, I told Jon that I wanted to tell her that she was my soul mate, I was going to do this by writing Guendoloena? (I had to look that name up to spell it; at the time I just knew the name was Gwen something) Jon told me that I shouldn't, I stopped myself and let my friend Jon begin to deceive her again.
<br>
<br>
I thought of Stonehenge then I knew the meaning of Stonehenge, I wanted to talk to her again the thoughts were forming in my mind; I let out a cry I'm Merlin! Yet I didn't fully believe it myself, my friend told her that I thought I was Merlin he let me talk to her again in the hope that she would think I was nuts. I said to her that it was me, she said Merlin, I said you said it not me, she said your Merlin again I said you say this I didn't tell you I was Merlin. She asked me what I thought about Stonehenge. When she asked me I immediately knew what Stonehenge symbolically represented to myself at that moment, I said to her that Stonehenge represented mans free will, I explained that if you stand in the middle of Stonehenge (which I've never done) you can walk through any of the seventy doors you want, I then explained that since Stonehenge has been built the stars have change position yet Stonehenge has remained in the same place, I then explained that this symbolically showed that the planets didn't control men and that mankind has freewill.
<br>
<br>
She kept calling me Merlin, then she said that she was going to Stonehenge the next day and that I could come on the trip with her if I got up early in the morning. Again I wanted to tell her she was my soul mate but Jon was getting interested and he wanted to talk to her again. I let Jon talk to her again, my mind was all over the place, I had the opportunity to meet my soul mate. I believed that if I went to see her I would die on the bus trip (I've always been scared of busses, My friend had saved my life once when I walked out into a bus he pulled me back and I felt the rush of wind as the bus was inches away from me) since then I've had it in me that I was meant to die on a bus/coach trip. In my mind I was deciding whether I should risk the doomed trip. I decided that I would go.
<br>
<br>
Now luckily, all this was completely flipped on its head. The Girls screen name was Extra-Testicle, which is rather like ET (which was on the other night) Anyway then, while Jon was talking to this lady she changed her name to Dan, Jon was absolutely astonished! While he and Aaron thought they were tricking this girl they both had actually been tricked by Dan. Jon couldn't believe it I was ok with it because I knew that something amazing had just happened the holy spirit had just gave me information about my soul mate through Dan. As well as this Dan had pulled off an amazing trick on us all. He later admitted that he didn't even plan it and that he just did it (work of the spirit). Anyhow that was a great lift off my shoulders, for I once again had been preparing myself for certain death and now I knew I would be ok. I mention this because I am a conscious light decoder; this means that I consciously use my intuition as well as unconsciously. The light bulb in my head switched on and I related your situation to my situation, and this situation.
<br>
<br>
Here's a synchronicity for you, my friend Matthew just walked in and he told me that it is snowing outside, the Ice Queen came to mind it was on this Christmas, Scarlet was the symbolic example of the Ice Queen (I never watched the whole lot).
<br>
<br>
As well as this I often see the number 33, I have been indirectly threatened by someone "not you" with the number 33. My Aura is pure brilliant blue; I have had a book in my possession titled "The Quest For Merlin" I have always loved the film Excalibur, one of my friends brothers knew somebody who went on a manic quest for Excalibur he found himself in Glastonbury on the edge of giving up hope, he looked into a shop window and Excalibur (From The Film) was in the window he took this sword and knighted my friends brother at Glastonbury.
<br>
<br>
To myself Excalibur represents the sword of truth found in matter, a truth that is almost completely unbearable. Along time ago in school I felt the urge to declare myself the Birdman, as you probably know Merlin was associated with the Raven, I'm sorry this is painful to write, my hands are shaky and I wonder if I'm doing the right thing, but I'll carry on. I started my quest around three years ago; although in truth I have always felt different from everyone and been searching for the unknown, around the age of 12 I was playing with the idea that our bodies were just shells Around five years ago (before I started to consciously search) I used to play a PC game on the Internet, this game was called Quake 2 my nickname was RailWizard, or what I'm decoding right this second Real Wizard.
<br>
<br>
Despite the implications of my post in the Magick section who's more powerful men or women, I'm a twenty-one year old virgin who's saving himself for the one, I've had my chances with beautiful women I've laid with them in bed while they wanted me, my body wanted them but I didn't feel as if I loved them so I resisted the temptation although I didn't know fully why I resisted, I always figured I'd find the right one.
<br>
<br>
So like everyone else I too have felt the pain of cupid's arrow, I phoned my family friend who unknown to everyone is a wise mystic appointed in this life to help me, he told me the pain I was feeling was because of guilt, I have just found out, this second that the pain is the guilt of loving the wrong women, Scarlet was the wrong one for me, which is why it hurt whenever I thought of her, but she will stay with me, she was a messenger she gave me the clues that I needed, just as I believe we all have our own messengers.
<br>
<br>
I could give you many other examples, like just the other day I was thinking of a butterfly, when I explained light and thought to my Mother and co last Sunday on impulse before I went I took my blue comb, tonight Rasputin was on the TV, My farther told me it was a film that I must see, At the start Alexia talks of Merlin, it said something like Merlin my real wizard, (I didn't hear it my friend said it, I thought he misheard it) I watched it and I can personally relate to Rasputine's agony. We then finished watching all the once upon a time in China films. When I got back from town the second time I saw Scarlet I was explaining to people on the local Bus Stop all about her, one of the people there was a girl I told her for a joke that I could probably write a whole book on the number 12, later that week my father told me that I would marry a younger girl (who I'd wait for) called anonymous, as you can see I'm decoding this to this situation, My fathers a Dumi he doesn't realise what he even says. This is something I added on the 25th on Sunday I went round my friends house, when I got there I couldn't stay as planed, the first thing I consciously/unconsciously saw in my friends room was a DVD called Repli-Anominous, some guy accidentally clones this lady then he falls in love for the real lady. As well as this, I was out with my friends we were talking to this nice lady in a bar; I was sitting down cross-legged on the floor attentively listening to her, she read are palms and Auras told us on how ladies liked to be treated she explained as much as she could to us, on this day I had submitted myself to my intuition, I was in flow with the spirit, I knew that the spirit was talking through her although she didn't know. A seat became available for myself I sat down now next to her my friend on the opposite side of her, she told me that my friend grounded me, and she told me not to get married without his say so, my hair was in a pony tail, and a few strands had flopped to the side she placed her hand on my hair and stroked it into place behind my ear, it flopped down again she did it again, her touch really relaxed me and I told her I felt like crying, then she started stroking my leg I told her to stop, she stopped then carried it on again, again I told her stop. My friend and me thanked her then we left.
<br>
<br>
This was the friend who I got the Repli Anominous DVD from. I've linked it together with when she said not to get married without his say so, the DVD is his say so, and he just didn't know it consciously.
<br>
<br>
Revelation is continually upon me earlier, for I know E =mc2 or we can do this another way, for example, I =mc2. I meaning I myself, I also meaning Illusion 'I' also as in the eee sounding I as in intelligence, intensify beautify and beautiful. Therefore its not E=mc2 but I =mc2. Also eye, like the all seeing eye.
<br>
<br>
I cant live like this anymore, its too painful, my farther and brother pierce my soul daily, there words are like poison, they literally condemn me to Hell with there words, I try telling them that they do but they think I've gone nuts, I live in the lucid moment I consciously and unconsciously decode light, I cant help but decode, and I have them verbally abusing me the way they do, all is light and thought to me, I decode my environment as either heaven or Hell, when there away from me I'm in heaven when there here they torment me, I feel there energy and it brings me down I try to help them and they hate me, my brother hates me and my farther they say they don't but I read nature, especially when I'm explaining. I tried telling my farther the theory, he just as good as rejected it all flat out told me that if it was any good we'd be making "Money" and I'd be on TV I tried explaining that I have no interest in money, I tried explaining that I solved dyslexia and proved relativity the other day, (here on AP, the post is now deleted) he became angry he hates it, as he says I think I'm too clever for him and he thinks I'm trying to lower him, he abuses the truth, and its in my nature to protect and reveal truth, when speaking of truth I simply wont back down they don't realise how they murder me, they think I've got everything easy, they couldn't be more wrong they cause me absolute indescribable pain, yet I am aware that I'm indestructible will (Manifest and Unmanifested Thought) this is what keeps me going, that and the faint hope in finding love.
<br>
<br>
You have to understand, in order to think the way I think I had to become nothing; the theory was a form of self written decentralisation meditation, I did this to give others hope, when I give hope I don't keep much for myself. So I'm everything and nothing, invincible (Not as in invincible I cant die invincible) yet a loose tong especially speaking in distress can temporarily cripple my whole life. I feel it's unfair to say this to you all, so just speak your minds speak your truths I can take anything thrown at me.
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I've really rabbited on I really hope I haven't messed with your head, I hope your all not afraid of me, and if I'm completely wrong about this I hope you all find love and have a lovely beautiful fulfilling lives.

<br>
There is much more to this testimony, it grows almost daily"
<br>
<br>
Anyway that's the main testimony, which also can be used in this situation. At the time of writing I was going through a very hectic phase, I cant really go into it, but the sense of invincibility and lethalness I felt I needed to feel, I was unconsciously preparing myself for word battle with Oazaki. At the moment I doubt Oazaki knows if he can or cannot trust me or whether I want to kill him or screw him. Like I said confusion is the greatest weapon, via writing to anonymous I knew that the Faithless tune would be effective to use in that situation, I work ahead of myself, just like I apologised ahead of myself and for upsetting and confusing people.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to point out that the first time I met Scarlet I was so happy because we had an instant mental connection, because of this connection and spontaneous outflow of love and praising she appeared beautiful to me (This was around Christmas Time). When I saw her again after Christmas even my friends said she looked different, she defiantly put on some weight, and it felt weird for me too I was questioning myself, I thought I saw past the image and all that but for some reason I was no longer physically attracted to her and that was confusing because previously I would have done anything for her.
<br>
<br>
I'll now quote myself I have segmented it to add the link-ups I'm making. Please note this is sync writing and I'm quoting myself.
<br>
<br>
"Hi and sorry I took so long to see this, I had not expected any further response... It is not so much romance I am interested in. I cannot describe it really, other than to say, it is a very powerful feeling that this man and I have work to do for some higher purpose...and that term came through in a piece of automatic writing prior to xmas."
<br>
<br>
I met Scarlet around Christmas Time this jumped out at me due to the way it mirrored my situation, also we have carried out part of this higher work, I've battled with myself, this has left me spiritually wounded, I'm basically dead yet I live. We also have the (=X=) Mas
<br>
<br>
"Basically, things, for now, have gone disastrously wrong lol. In that, as a result of my loose tongue, he lost his place on an internet site and has blocked all contact with me. And of course, I have thought to myself over and over...this is stupid...why cling onto foolish, empty hopes, why bother looking at the signs, why bother ACTUALLY believing in anything beyond what I see happening?"
<br>
<br>
For me the similarities are self-evident. Flip the situation on its head and see it in reverse. Anonymous has blocked all contact with me also when I took on the name Dum1 with her distressed 'loose tongue' she revealed who I was, and as you know better then I the invisible position and respect I held for being 'honest' and 'wise' amongst the moderators and anyone else they choose to pass this rumour onto, has been torn apart, in there eyes I'm a twisted cyber-stalker. In order for the teachings to work people need to trust me, needless to say there trust in me is beyond repair, thus via there own freewill they'll not taste life, and now I'll have to be careful in how I speak, for the words just come to me, I don't write cryptically because I want to, I write cryptically because I just do, and because I write cryptically people will see what they want to see, i.e. they'll think I'm subtly trying to communicate with them. On top of this, when she revealed who I was my feelings felt betrayed by her, I emailed her telling her that I'd be on some other forum site (before I even knew they were her forums) I also forgave her, again she took this all the wrong way.

"There have been just too many signs for me to ignore, there really have. For one, his actions of late are exactly mirroring mine a few months ago. It is like watching myself making mistakes all over again."
<br>
<br>
Well, again I think this is self-evident, flip it on its head, there are way to many signs for me to ignore and I'm demonstrating some of these signs to you right now. She has made the same mistake all over again, and she doesn't even know she's doing it, all I wont to do is comfort her and protect her, but I know if I communicate with her I'll be kicked from the AP, and thus I wont be able to continue doing DUM's will, so its giving up Love to teach and on top of this I have the moderators unknowingly gunning for me.

"I dont know what more I can say, other than that it isnt just about romance..it isnt about love alone...it is this tremendously deep feeling that he and I are meant to...just be! I have had many come in and out of my life, but none have struck such a note with me as this."
<br>
<br>
Her words speak for me, replace the 'he' with 'her'

"I sometimes sit here and it feels as though I can see and feel his soul...to me, his essence is like pure light...it doesnt matter if we are in conflict on this plane, at a soul level, there is a wonderful connection."
<br>
<br>
Well this is self-evident Dumi speak,
<br>
<br>
"it doesnt matter if we are in conflict on this plane, at a soul level, there is a wonderful connection." We are in conflict; they think I'm a crazy cyber-stalker.

"Would you easily let that go? Just forget it and cast it off as a delusion ?"
<br>
<br>
The sync is so bang on so I'll say it Frankly, would you easily let that go? Just forget it and cast it off as a delusion?
<br>
<br>
I'll quote you now.

"In my view, what you have done is fallen in love with the idea of falling in love with this man. As opposed to actually falling in love with this man directly. And it sounds to me very much like he has done basically the same as you."
<br>
<br>
This is what I did; I fell in love with the idea of falling in love. I'm a young man who's been saving himself for the one, I find the one, obviously my sexual feelings click into overdrive, guys put yourself in my situation, there beautiful there poems are beautiful they communicates openly and honestly there into Merlin and native Indians, I've declared myself Merlin and I've considered going to see the Hopi Indians and on top of this she older then myself and thus experienced, I just wanna make love, real love anything ever desired, its so crazy I don't even know if I'm being tempted or not.

"I wondered if you knew what each other looked like before you met? I don't mean this to sound harsh, but perhaps the problem boils down to the fact that, despite everything, you didn't match up to there idea of mental attractiveness. I know this sounds a bit stoneage-caveman, but women do place "mental attractiveness" or rather their idea of mental attractiveness at (or very close to) the top of their list, so to speak."
<br>
<br>
Again reverse scenario, I have never met this person in the Physical, but I have exposed my soul to them over the AP. As well as this we have the Stoneage-Caveman link-up found in the Dumi is a complement thread. And note the Scarlet situation. I changed the Physical attractiveness that was written above to mental attractiveness just to show how reverse the situation is.
<br>
<br>
"Whether that's the reason or not I don't know. But it strikes me as odd that despite everything the two of you said previously, there was no great explosion of physical/mental activity as regards your feelings for one another. But in a way that harps back to what I said about the two of you falling in love with the idea as opposed to the actuality."
<br>
<br>
Again reverse scenario. This Dumi explained to me that they felt no Spiritual Connection to me whatsoever, this was very strange for me because I never felt so certain about anything else in my life, however we did in some eerie way exchange poetry, as far as I was concerned, this Dumi was my soul mate no two ways about it.

"To my mind, either love works or it doesn't. If two people don't have that certain "spark" in the first place then no amount of computer keyboarding and telephone texting can make up for it. In a way, you took a 50-50 gamble that, as unfortunate as it may appear, didn't pay off. Please don't think I'm being critical, not a bit. I'd have done the same, and what you said in the beginning sounds really exciting. To become so passionate over one another is lovely. But in a way, it was a kind of virtual experience, not an actual one. You could say it was kind of like a computer simulation of the real thing."
<br>
<br>
Again this is a reverse scenario, I went through all the feelings of love, I have been through the same physical scenario with the women I met called Scarlet.
<br>

"I asked the guy if Scarlet was working as I asked him I thought of some black and white film were the guy asks the same thing I asked him." (Computer simulation of
