Hi!
<br>
I'm new to the forum and soooooo thrilled I found you all.

I have had a few OBEs and frequently astral project spontaneously, usually upon waking in the morning. The thing I never could understand, though, was a certain thing that happens all the time where it seems like I'm watching a movie when I close my eyes and get comfortable and focused. I read the posting on Phasing - Yayyyyyy, it sounds exactly like what I experience!!!

Finally a name for it.

Thanks so much for all the warm welcomes! So sorry I posted then did not return for a few days, my father is in the hospital so I have been spending all of my time with him and my mother.
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
Crystal
