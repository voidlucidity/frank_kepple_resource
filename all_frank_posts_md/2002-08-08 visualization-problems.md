I've read Robert's book, and I've succeeded going into trance a couple of times.  The problem is that I usually wake up to a light trance, and I can't (yet) consciously put myself into Trance.  I have a pretty good feel for quieting my mind, actually, my problem is with creating an internal falling situation.  I used to be able to imagine myself in an elevator gradually going down, but as of recently, everytime I create this scenario I can't help but feel something comparable to the elevator cable snapping and me plummeting with it.  I know that fear is the enemy, but I was hoping I could descend peacefully and slowly, not like this.  Any suggestions?

I feel there is always a potential problem generated from using some kind of "exit technique" like the elevator or rope-trick. Which may or may not be true in your case, but if it can be of help........
<br>
<br>
My theory is that, at first, people imagine a rope or elevator and, because they are new to it, they are not really visualising a rope or elevator: just the merest hint of one. Now, because these techniques can work so well they might get some early results. They suddenly think, "Wow, there's really something to this projection stuff". Which naturally gives them a strong encouragement to continue.
<br>
<br>
And here comes the pitfall: they think that by concentrating on the "exit technique" more, they will get better results. Because of this, there is a strong tendency for the person to concentrate on the exit-technique to the extent where they begin engaging in the mental act of creative visualisation. Which, of course, is not Astral Projection.

Thanks, Frank.  I probably forgot the most important detail.  This is when I'm trying to induce trance.  My descent feels to rapid.  Sorry for the confusion.  Does your advice still hold true?

Having feelings of descending or ascending rapidy is part and parcel of the "exit process" at first. For example, I used to get feelings like I had been shot from a cannon. But sometimes it would go the other way, and I'd get a falling sensation which felt like I'd thrown myself off the top of some tall building.
<br>
<br>
For years I experienced these sensations and thought they were a normal part of the process. But I since learned that the process can be slowed down to the extent where I can now exit with no extreme sensations at all.
<br>
<br>
After a while your protective sense of conscious awareness just gets used to it. Like if you were to ride the same roller-coaster time after time.
