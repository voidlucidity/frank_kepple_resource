<section>
I was wondering, do electromagnetic feilds effect entities big and small? I only ask this because I've heard tales of people picking up radio stations while OBE'ing be it Astral, or real time OBE. I figure if someone on the astral can sense EM waves, can other entities as well? Maybe some are really sensitive to the powerfull broadcasts and have fled this realm, much like a person fleeing a loud and constant noise.
<br>
<br>
Any truth to this?
<br>
<br>
Thanx-

WEll, let's see. I'll tell you what I can.
<br>
<br>
Yes, many people do claim that EM fields can interfere with "psychic" phenomenon.
<br>
<br>
People do hear radios and music. I know I've heard music that sounded like the radio before. I don't know if was the radio, though, because they didn't play a call sign.
<br>
<br>
If physical life is sensitive to EM fields, and everything else is supposedly beyond and capable of sensing all that is physical, then, yeah, I don't see why they can't be affected.

There are lots of what you might call radio stations broadcasting within the astral. The physical reflects the astral, not the other way around (as many assume). I think what people must have done is tune into an astral radio station and assumed they were picking up a physical-realm station. It's easy done I suppose.
<br>
<br>
Not only can you tune into "radio stations" but all kinds of music as well.

I often encounter high tension power lines when I fly near the RTZ. Also, a couple of times I found myself trapped in a displaced, grid like structure around some houses, possible electrical wires. However my most interesting accident was when my separating subtle body has attached to the ventillator's cage that was stood at the end of my bed.
<br>
<br>
The physical body is only a tip of an iceberg, so to speak. The physical reflects the etheric, which is the realm of electromagnetic fields. On the opposite the astral is governed by expectations that based on our current physical life.
<br>
<br>
Although I had many "astral radio experiences," most of them proved to be hallucination. I come to a conclusion that they are interpretation of the increased noises we hear around the separational stage. The noises are very likely caused by increased gamma activity in the temporal lobe which is, according to Persinger and others, is a natural concomitant of most altered states.

Persinger has also published a number of articles on how geomagentic activity alters pychic functioning. In one article, i forget the title or the date(i can get back to you on this if you are interested in reading it), he found that there was an increase in poltergeist activity reported during periods of high geomagnetic activity.

I have had an experienced paranormal researcher say that she is beginning to notice a link to the Sleep Paralysis state that a number of Astral Projectors use to enter the RTZ an a high level reading on Tri field EM Fields in there homes.  Could the Astral be creating EM Ossolations to assist people to project ?

Radio signals can be hooked up, if the radio station is not far away. Just put an iron container full of water on a stove.This will work as medium to receive audio peaks.
<br>
Human body is more than 70% out of water,  it is possible to be tuned for moon and EM activities.
