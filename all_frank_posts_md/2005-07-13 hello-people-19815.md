I am new at this forum, I must say that it is quite exhilarating to finally have some hope in achieving astral travel with you people around to help me. I would like to quickly introduce myself before going and relishing in this site's massive contents. I am kevorn. Kevorn daley. I have been trying to AP for about 2 weeks now, and i'm not getting impatient, as I understand that such a practice takes time. I also enjoy reading about other people's experiences and ordeals, because it gives me an unwavering attitude and urges me to acheive this all the more.
