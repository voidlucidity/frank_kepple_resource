<section>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
I have launched the book and site for
<b>
 Our Ultimate Reality, Life, the Universe and the Destiny of Mankind today
</b>
<br>
<br>
I will repeat the URL again later in this message, but here is
<br>
the URL:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.ourultimatereality.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.ourultimatereality.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Our Ultimate Reality
</b>
is the culmination of over 2 years writing
<br>
based on my own seeking, experiences and knowledge over the course
<br>
of 40 years. During that time I have been priveledged to have
<br>
learned a tremendous amount from many diverse sources. Our Ultimate
<br>
Reality now brings the benefit of those 40+ years to its readers
<br>
over the course of 684 pages and 144 chapters.
<br>
<br>
Although the book flows seamlessly from beginning to end it is also
<br>
a reference work for many valuable abilitities such as Astral
<br>
Projection, OBE, Healing, Concentration, Attracting Wealth and
<br>
much, much more. I have included a fill list of chapters at the end
<br>
of this newsletter.
<br>
<br>
By buying Our Ultimate Reality you will immediately benefit from
<br>
what I have personally learned, practiced and achieved over the
<br>
last 40 years, much of which you can out into practice immediately
<br>
to achieve results in the next 40 days!
<br>
<br>
Of particular interest, based on the many emails I receive on this
<br>
subject, will be my best 3 methods for achieving Astral projection
<br>
and OBE. While success cannot be guaranteed, being subject to so
<br>
many different variables, not the least of which is personal
<br>
commitment, I can say that in my opinion these methods provide the
<br>
very best chance so far of achieving Astral projection and OBE.
<br>
<br>
I am also offering for a time three valuable additional bonuses:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Abyss:
</b>
This is a binaural brainwave synchronisation MP3 for use
<br>
with meditation, Astral Projection, OBE, Healing, Manifestaion and
<br>
many other things. Abyss first appeared in its original form over 2
<br>
years ago, but since then has evolved considerably into a state of
<br>
the art binaural brainwave entrainment MP3 that has been developed
<br>
not only based on the feedback of many people, but also based on
<br>
the detailed analysis of many other well known, and expensive
<br>
binaural products out here. Abyss incorporates the best of them all!
<br>
Abyss can be used for a range of purposes, including but not
<br>
 limited to meditation, wealth, health, Astral projection, OBE and
 <br>
  much more. Abyss perfectly compliments the main book.
  <br>
   <br>
    <b>
     The Power of Concentration:
    </b>
    The ability to concentrate effectively
    <br>
    is an absolutely crucial prerequisite to achieving anything at all
    <br>
    of real, long-term value. The truth of this most important fact of
    <br>
    this cannot be underestimated.This exceptional book, The Power of
    <br>
    Concentration, was originally written by Theron Dumont in 1918, but
    <br>
    the information and teachings therein are as valid today as ever.
    <br>
    This is what the author himself says about concentration: "Success
    <br>
    is assured when you are able to concentrate, for you are then able
    <br>
    to utilize for your good all constructive thoughts and shut out all
    <br>
    the destructive ones. It is of the greatest value to be able to
    <br>
    think only that which will be beneficial."
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>
     A Guide to Psychic Defense:
    </b>
    It is a shocking yet true fact that we
    <br>
    are all constantly subject to psychic attacks by many different
    <br>
    different types and levels from inner and psychic beings and
    <br>
    forces.  These attacks range from unintentional attacks by people
    <br>
    with forceful personalities such as some sales people, friends,
    <br>
    relatives and partners, through full demonic possession. This is a
    <br>
    more serious issue than people realize! In A Guide to Psychic
    <br>
    Defense you will learn everything you need to know about all forms
    <br>
    of psychic attack, how to prevent it, and what you can do if you
    <br>
    have been attacked.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am truly humbled and honoured by the amazing feedback I have
    <br>
    received from those people who have read Our Ultimate Reality, and
    <br>
    can only hope that everyone finds the book of equal value.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to the book, I am delighted to launch a brand new
    <br>
    forums resource dedicated to the subjects covered in the book.
    <br>
    These forums will be very focussed and highly moderated from the
    <br>
    outset by some of the moderators you are already familiar with and
    <br>
    who do such exceptional work at the Astral Pulse. Quality is the
    <br>
    emphasis from the outset, and all membership applications will be
    <br>
    approved by myself. I hope to see many of you there!
    <br>
    <br>
    As always I really appreciate all suggestions that in any way
    <br>
    improve the quality of the forums for the benefit of everyone.
    <br>
    <br>
    I also very much appreciate comments on the newsletter and in
    <br>
    particular what you would like to see included in the future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once again The URL of the new site is:
    <br>
    <br>

     http://www.ourultimatereality.com
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    And thank you once again for your wonderful support, and I hope to
    <br>
    see you at the new forums as well as here as ever!
    <br>
    <br>
    Best regards,
    <br>
    <br>
    Adrian.
