Ok, can clouds be manipulated on the ground?  I saw someone do this once, and had a general understand of how to do it.
<br>
I was wondering if anyojne knew anything about it or if there were websites about it

I've had an experience like this, but not manipulating the clouds as such, but the wind. For some reason I've always had some level of connection with the wind. Can't explain it any further than this though.

With enough Psycho-kinetic power, or with enough built up energy, a person CAN affect a clouds certain shape.
<br>
<br>
Of personal experience i've managed to help clear up a cluster of gathering clouds.... I didn't effect them in a way of, me just looking at them, and them dissapearing, but more to a point of, focusing on the general area of the clouds, and with useing my energy, trying to push a giant area of air upwards, in an attempt to break up the main gathering point of the clouds. I didnt want it to get dark that day... I was enjoying the sun..... That DID however leave me rather drained of energy.... But i was happy i did that, and that i had more sun.

Have a look on Neil Slade's website. It's about clicking foward the "amygdala" in your brain to access greater awareness, but it talks about cloud busting:

Just will it, or imagine rays coming from your eyes if you like. This stuff seems to be easier with moving systems (like water vapor in convection currents) than with static ones (like a rock), but it's just a matter of faith and dumb luck. You can even make photrealistic shapes do weird stuff. It's pretty cool, but almost worthless if you don't have to find or grow your own food. Maybe it will save lives to be able to dissapate bad storms?

Thats suprises me that you bring this up. I can manipulate a rainstorm once it has formed. I can take a quick 10 seconds of though and just out of will cause the rain to slow or stop for a set period of time. Then as soon as Im at my location, BOOM! Rain comes crashing back down again, rather funny actually :-/

   So glad you told me this.
   <br>
   <br>
   Although the site is a bit odd, it is very informative indeed.  I'm still reading it all now, and probably won't do anything about it until tomorrow (school still in session...)

I used to play baseball in the summer (until I found fencing (or physical chess), which IS the ultimate sport) anyway, whenever I got sent to the outfield and it was a hot day, I found I could make the wind pick up around me unconsiencly. This never happened when I tried to make it move.

   I may have and I may not have had any luck.  During church this one time (this was like 8 at night), we all heard thunder like really loud with 5-10 minutes remaning in the mass.  My friend leans over and asks "Do you think it's raining?"  That was when I remembered what I read online.  I tried it then.  By the time we had gotten out of church, there was loads of thunder and lightning, but no rain.  Walk like 30 feet and there's more than enough rain for a river. It could've been a coincidence, but who cares.

This thread reminds me a few weeks ago, there was this imposing cloud formation, and I asked my youngest, Aroa, what he saw in the sky. Without hesitation he answered, 'breasts' (tetas, in Spanish). Aroa is only two and a half years old, maybe his mother weaned him too soon.
