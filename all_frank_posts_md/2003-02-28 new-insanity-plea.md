This isn't to offend anyone but I took this from the "psychic self defense" board.  Im not a person who thinks there are not negs out there.. in fact Im the opposite of that.  But Im curious what open minded people off the board think of blaming everything on negs.  I asked where's the personal responsibility.  Just because something in your head tells you to do something and you act on it are you not to blame just because its  a "neg"
<br>
<br>
This was the post that has made me a little disillusioned of that board:

I was victimized by this software! It occured many months ago, and
<br>
the user of the software finally told me what he was doing and that
<br>
he was using this software. He convinced me to perform sexual acts
<br>
on a dog for a long period of time and I was completely out of my
<br>
mind. I feel like a great evil was committed against me. DO NOT
<br>
CONTINUE TO DISTRIBUTE THIS SOFTWARE

Are we going to be able to blame people as well as negs for everything we do now?
<br>
<br>
I pointed out on that board everytime we do something positive how many times does one point at angels or a positive entity making them do it.  But if they get a negative thought and start molesting their dog its suddenly a negative.  I was more appauled by the people who thought it was only logical it was a negative making this person doing that.. They were under psychic assault by this tape by a negative person thats what made them do it.  because its illogical they'd do this unless they were under psychic attack.  Are we now going to base all illogical actions on negs because they're illogical.  Anyone else see the faulty logic in that.
<br>
<br>
This post isn't to offend anyone, but I honestly want people's opinions on where blaming entites around us starts and personal responsibilities begin.  Can i claim "i have a weak mind and an evil neg made me kill that person".  For me this would be a very negative outcome of RB's book if it indeed became that.

No offence meant, but I think we have to accept that the PSD forum has been specifically set out for people - who are into that kind of thing - to discuss their experiences. Which they have every right to do, IMO.

In Robert Bruce's first interview on the Art Bell show he talks about insanity and problems caused by negs. He said that some people just go mad and have their own crazy reasons for what they do. Naturally, of all people, these would be the least qualified to say what their experiences were. The fact that their mind was disturbed at the time that the observation was made could only provide unreliable observations. If it was all due to negs then Robert Bruce would not have said that he could do tests to distinguish between possession and insanity. He went on to say that possession usually results in mental disturbance and that it is not of much practical use to make this sort of distinction. Buddhism teaches that it is best to be mentally and emotionally healthy for preventative reasons because negs find people who are disturbed to be easier targets. Robert Bruce said that it is good to remove core images before negs find them and take advantage of them. As far as responsibility for consequences is concerned, shouldn't that depend on the exact circumstances?

Tom thats a very good point.  And you're absolutly right when you say it depends on the situation.  For me the situation is someone performing sexual acts on their dog.  Im not talking about any other issue but this.
<br>
<br>
I am putting this here because I know many people who follow these things cross the spectrum.  Most believe in entities as well as astral projection and energy.

personally, i don't blame anyone but myself for my actions unless i have a really good reason to believe that i have been manipulated, which isn't very often.
<br>
<br>
i think some people pawn their failings off on others because they already have a low self esteem and they subconsciously don't want to feel even worse about them selves. sometimes though it really is something else manipulating the person. it's very difficult to know the difference usually, and sometimes it is nigh impossible to determine the cause of an action.
<br>
<br>
as for this email specifically, if the tape can be found to have subliminal messages on it then the author of the tape is guilty, otherwise there is no way to prove it. after all, there are many people who plea guilty to crimes they've never commited; some because they want the attention, and others for their own reasons.
