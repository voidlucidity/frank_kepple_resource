Hello all!
<br>
<br>
My name is Nils, I am 31 years old and living in Germany. Since childhood I am fascinated by the astral projection phenomenon, but haven't had OOBE experiences yet. Not that I have not tried, but I have to admit, that there always was some kind of fear. Fear of things I will see on the astral plane (frightening beings), fear of failing and so on. I know they are foolish and needless thoughts, but I can't get rid of them completely.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, mostly at weekends, when I wake up in the morning and decide to sleep on, I feel myself fall into conscious paralysis, with a sense of vibration, but don't get any further due to my excitement and fear. Unfortunately, I am not able to create this state of paralysis on my own.
<br>
<br>
Recently, surfing the WWW, I found an article regarding the Brain Wave Generator-Software. I got curious and decided to get that program. Last night, I tried it using a custom made preset called "Boxed Nirvana" from the library and it worked in the matter of altering my state of mind. For short moments, I could see mist swirling in front of my closed eyes and the other moment I felt my whole body vibrating. Then it vanished, again due to my growing excitement.
<br>
<br>
In the BWGen forums I found a link to the Astral Pulse forum and I didn't hesitate to join, cause I definitely need any help I can get from experienced Astral Projectors. I am glad I found my way here and I hope I can contribute to the community as well.
<br>
<br>
Greetings from Germany,
<br>
Nils
