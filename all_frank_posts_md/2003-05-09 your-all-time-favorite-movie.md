The book "Fight Club" had a much stronger impact on me than the movie. For some reason, though, I no longer have the same reaction as to the first time seeing it and then reading the book. It seems to say to me that complete destruction leading to non-existence is the best choice when choosing an existence is too difficult.

I haven't seen any de Sica's films. Wasn't he a neo-realist? Bicycle Thief is excellent from what I've heard. The local video store's suck in the classic's department.
<br>
Actually La Strada is the only film that's ever reduced me to tears because of its effect. Very powerful stuff that.

Hmmm, so many good movies to pick from. I haven't heard of a lot of these movies people have picked as their favourite.
<br>
<br>
I would say either the Rocky movies, I love those movies, It shows you what love, strength and dedication are all about. Or the Lion King, or maybe Forest gump.
<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I think The rocky movies, but I couldnt say which one, its all one whole story so I'll class it as one. But the lion king comes a close second, hehe:) Oh and the karate kid movies, musnt forget those.

Athios,
<br>
<br>
Weeeeell, I have seen Fellowship at the movies twice, Two Towers once , have the limited edition box set fo Fellowship with all the extra footage, which BTW, really makes the movie line up brilliantly with the book, and can't wait for the L.E. DVD box set release of Two Towers. I've only seen Fellowship 4 times so far, so I've another 5-6 viewings to go before I'll class it as my favourite.
<br>
<br>
By the time I get the L.E. sets of all 3 movies it will certainly be the most expensive part of my DVD collection, so they'd BETTER BE my favourite movies by then!!!

   Seriously, LoTr really sucked. It was one of those movies you anticipated for months and months and then it just sucks.  The book is always better.
   <br>
   <br>
   This isn't the case at all for Matrix Reloaded
   <img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
   I've seen probably 20 trailers for this movie and all I can say is "WOW". People say that sequels usually suck, Try saying that when Reloaded grosses in 1 billion dollars.

American Beauty, Amelie, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon are the 3 that switch around as my favorite, mainly the first 2. Some other good ones are Monsoon Wedding, Gladiator, and of course The Lord of the Rings. Donnie Darko was cool, whoever put that one up, very weird and thought provoking. I want to see an anime movie called Grave of the Fireflies, I've heard it's the most depressing movie ever and will make anyone cry, it's about 2 orphans during WWII Japan, they both die, it's not one of those bloody anime. Speaking of anime, everyone should watch anything they can find of Rurouni Kenshin, it's the best anime ever.  Ben

Yes, the Lord of the Rings movies really SUCKED!
<br>
After reading the book three or four times, the movies were a real pain to watch. I'm not getting my hopes up for the third part.
<br>
There's just no atmosphere .. I don't know ...
<br>
It was a grave mistake to cast the Matrix Agent as Elrond ... every scene he is in, I half expect him to start saying "Mr Anderson..."

Wow...I can't believe how bad some people's taste in films is...but that's my OPINION.  I mean, Lord of the Rings, they are amazing.  Nearly every critic was stunned by the direction, sound and overall cinematography of the epic films, which, by the way, will make over a billion dollars once it's all said and done (not necessarily in the box office, but including video releases etc)
<br>
<br>
How much a movie makes isn't necessarily an indication of how good it is (most of the time it's NOT the case).
<br>
<br>
...and Starship Troopers...uggh!  I'm sorry, and once again this is my OPINION, but here is what just a few critics had to say:
<br>
"Terrific entertainment."
<br>
-- Joe Baltake, SACRAMENTO BEE
<br>
<br>
"This flick wallows in just about every moth-ridden cliche known to the film industry and relies almost entirely on naked teenage girls and recycled special effects for what it deems excitement."
<br>
-- Rob Blackwelder, SPLICEDWIRE
<br>
<br>
"Nobody objects to a simple gross-out proposition on the big screen. But here too, Starship Troopers doesn't quite make it."
<br>
-- Liz Braun, JAM! MOVIES
<br>
<br>
"If viewed as a comedy, Starship Troopers is quite enjoyable..."
<br>
-- Carlo Cavagna,
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///aboutfilm.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 ABOUTFILM.COM
</a>
<br>
<br>
"Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies."
<br>
-- Liam Lacey, GLOBE AND MAIL
<br>
<br>
"Manages to be both fun and shocking -- sometimes in the same shot."
<br>
-- Mick LaSalle, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<br>
<br>
"Lacks the courage of the book's fascist conclusions."
<br>
-- Scott Rosenberg,
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///salon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 SALON.COM
</a>
<br>
<br>
"Maybe the filmmakers are so lost in their slambang visual effects that they don't give a hoot about the movie's scariest implications."
<br>
-- Richard Schickel, TIME MAGAZINE

Toy Story 2 is better than Godfather when....

<section>
Great picture!  Yes, from Rottentomatoes.
<br>
<br>
Obviously Toy Story 2 has less artistic value than, let's say, the Godfather...but because (and I think I mentioned this) that list is based on the number of positive reviews, then it just reflects it's general "likability."  That's art for you, it's totally subjective.  One man's treasure is another man's trash, and vice versa.
<br>
<br>
I knew many would not be able to name just one film, so here is a short list of some of my all time favs (some from childhood and some from recently):
<br>
<br>
E.T.
<br>
Il Ladro delle Bicicleta
<br>
StarWars
<br>
A River Runs Through It
<br>
The Godfather (I and II)

you can't say lord of the rings sucked because it didn't end up being exactly like the book.  the movie was incredible.  i didn't read all of the books and i don't konw about the discrepencies.  if you never read the book, would you still say the movie sucked?
<br>
<br>
the big lebowski is the best movie i've ever seen.  every scene is brilliant.

Despite not being a motion picture, I think Band Of Brothers deserves to be on the "best" list. So much better than Saving Private Ryan(which was great). Plus it lasted about 10 hours.

I have read up on what those who have seen Reloaded have to say and it sounds like it's gonna be heavy on action and skimpy on plot/narrative...which means a lot of eye candy and CGI, and hey, because it's the Matrix it's gonna be cool.  So the consensus seems to be that it's not only going to break records as far as ticket sales, etc. but that it's pretty good, but it lacks that special something the original had, but that's the curse of the sequel.  I am going to see Friday night with a bunch of buddies (and because the wife is out of town, afterwards we are going to have a huge Halo tournament- 5 xboxes, 4 tv's and a projector for one of them....shaweeeet!)

re: LotR
<br>
I didn't really read the book. I honestly tried my best to read it. I finished The Hobbit quite happily. But by the time I got to halfway through Book 1 of LotR, I just
<b>
 had
</b>
to stop. It was just soooooooooooooooo boring.  [xx(]
<br>
I don't know why, I usually like this stuff.
<br>
<br>
<br>
re: Matrix Reloaded
<br>
Hmm, I didn't really like this nearly as much as I did the first one.
<br>
<br>
Hmm.......some of the backgrounds were ugly, badly done. The texture was just waaaaaay off from the things in the foreground.
<br>
One of the main guys (Link) acting was........not as good. I didn't like his 'being funny' scenes.
<br>
I could actually
<i>
 see
</i>
that some of the agents aren't Agent Smith. I mean, I'd at least expect them to cut and paste his face on them, but I guess they were too lazy to do that.
<br>
(yes, I'm really picky)
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, it was niiiiiiiiiiiice.............  [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>

<br>
I liked the first one better, but the villians in this one are better.
<br>
<br>
Here's why I liked the first one better:
<br>
Even though I watched it in theatre, on DVD, and on TV, I never had any complaints about the movie (visual-wise).
<br>
It was sort of the defining film of our generation (maybe like how Star Wars was back in the 70s), like a pinnacle of 'coolness' in movies. It has some degree of cultural impact.
<br>
<br>
But for Matrix Reloaded, while it did further the story, it was just more of the same stuff (and done less well). While it's still Really Good, it just lacks the special 'feel' to make the leap to Awesome.
<br>
For me anyway.
<br>
<br>
Sorry for being off topic.  [
