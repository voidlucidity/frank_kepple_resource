<section>
I have a very experienced source that tells me that 40% of the general population knows of something "more" but dont persue because of fear, or they think it's their imagination.
<br>
<br>
10% Of the general population know and have somewhat practiced in the etheral arts, but show no real interest, as of yet.
<br>
<br>
Then theres 5% of the pop are actually practicing the etheric arts.
<br>
<br>
Are these numbers accurate, or are these close enough?
<br>
<br>
Thanx-

I would actually say 5% sounds high. More like 2-3 sounds good to me. 10% I might raise a bit to 30-40. 40 i would raise to 60.
<br>
<br>
But i know nothing, and might be wrong.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
It depends on your definition of actually practicing "etheric arts". Ever so many individuals go through phases of engaging all manner of subjective practices that are often drug fuelled, but not necessarily. In which case the 5% figure could well be about right. But as for people knowingly shifting their focus of attention to different regions in consciousness with a degree of repeatability, I would say you are looking at way less than 1% of the population.
<br>
<br>
Plus, there is the other issue of definition. Personally, I would not consider myself to be engaging in any kind of "etheric art". I'm simply shifting my focus of attention around the wider spectrum of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

93% of statistics are made up on the spot.

my source is my manager where I work. I was quite pleased to have found someone to 'shoot the breeze' about such things. He tells me these figures based on who comes into the resturaunt. He's been there for 2 years, so I'd imagine the amount of who is and who isnt has been averaged out for him. He works there almost everyday from open to 5-6pm so I trust his judgement on that.
<br>
<br>
And by defining the level of advancement, he says that he gets a weak fuzz, strong fuzz, or a defined fuzz. And mine of course is somewhat defined, but the ones with the strong fuzz (he tells me) knows whats going on, but they just arent pursuing the subject at this time due to lack of interest or will to do so.

But that's just fuzzy stuff...
<br>
<br>
My advice is to take what anyone else says with a bucket-full of salt.

At the army base i'm at there's about 1000 people, of those i have thus far found 5people that know of and practise some form of metaphysical/psi/magick.
<br>
In Norway every boy at 18 has to join the army if he is fit for service, thus this gives somewhat of a good idea on how the statistics on this age group (18-20) would look.
