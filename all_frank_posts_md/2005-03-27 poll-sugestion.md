I dont know how does work a forum, how much difficult its to maintain it or to creating things.
<br>
<br>
I have no idea about that things, so if you are a moderator or Adrian, dont be offended with my question.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to change the forum in a way that makes possible, for any poster, to create a poll?
<br>
<br>
If that happens it would be fun (i suppose) and even useful. For example you could create a poll related with AP techniques (this is just a typical example) and learn wich techniques are the most used.
<br>
<br>
I mean, maybe it would be useful and fun, but for doing that the best thing to do (again: another supposition) its to create a forum (here in APforums) just for polls questions.
<br>
<br>
Useful questions with lots of answers could get sticky.
<br>
<br>
This is just an idea
<br>
<br>
What do you think about it?
<br>
<br>
("Oh no! My head! More troubles for me!"-this is Adrian thinking

)
<br>
<br>
(Edit was just for spell mistakes- and i know i still have a lot, but you get the message).

I like your idea Kazbadan.

I noticed that polls are only enabled in the  Bugs And Questions Forum at the moment.

<section>
I didnt knew that.
<br>
<br>
I would like to hear a moderator or Adrian.
<br>
<br>
Maybe its harder than i think to improve such idea.
<br>
<br>
Lets see what they have to say.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Polls can be created subject to approval. Provided the subject of the poll is reasonably viable (i.e. not frivolous) then there should be no problem setting it up.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
With the "automatic poll" anyone could create a poll without boring moderators.
<br>
<br>
A section dedicated only for polls would be interesting.
<br>
<br>
We could made interesting questions i think.
<br>
<br>
But, to be honest, a poll maybe its not useful in this moment in AP.
<br>
<br>
Dont be offended but i dont see to much people in the forums i think. There are not much people participating.
<br>
<br>
Dont know what its happening.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I remember the times when i post something and in the next day i would have lots of replys and my thread was on the bottom due to the quantity of new threads posted.
<br>
<br>
Whats going on?
<br>
<br>
C´mon people, you should be more active! Dont be afraid...ket your shyness somewhere and make questions, say funny things, give ideas, anything!

<section>
boring moderators ?! we aren't boring !! hee hee...
<br>
<br>
Just joking Kazbadan - I get what you're saying. If you have any poll ideas (within reason of course), send them to a moderator &amp; we'll set them up.
