<section>
I phased successfully I think. I was totally unaware of my physical body and traveled across a lake, walked down a dirt road, did some floating, visited my front and back yard, all along feeling like it was very dream like, not real.
<br>
<br>
I understand that having an out-of-body experience is like you're really there, no mistaking it. I tried to make out a license plate of a car on a street and it was like a guessing game, nothing was clear. If I was truly having an out-of-body experience wouldn't something like that be more exact?
<br>
<br>
I'd like some input on where I got to and how to get to a stage where the experience seems more real and solid. I feel I was just following my imagination and that was all.
<br>
<br>
Was I in Focus 2? If so, how do I move onto Focus 3?

<section>
i've been trying to phase as well and i had a similar experience. it's not as nice as yours, but i'm just not sure if i was falling asleep...
<br>
<br>
i was wide awake, but it felt like i was "nodding off" for a half second and i would see somthing.
<br>
<br>
i think the problem is the experience felt like somthing when i fall asleep.
<br>
<br>
i mean, it felt like a sensation felt when i fall asleep.... this sense of motion.
<br>
<br>
sorry i could not answer your question as i really don't know.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The Phasing Model of Consciousness does not incorporate mystical notions such as "out of body". Nothing can possibly occur outside of ourselves. I understand that so-called "gurus" will charge often well over a thousand USD a week to tell you otherwise but that's just BS. Take it from me, nothing happens outside of yourself. Years ago they looked at the rising and the setting of the sun. It was obvious the sun moves around the earth. Anyone could see the sun moves around the earth. It rises, it falls, it must therefore move around us. Well, science makes its living cutting great swathes through nonsense like that, and this topic is set to be no different.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

It appears to me that you were having an F2oC experience. F2oC is also where we do our dreaming (according to the model) and, as such, it would probably feel similar to a dream if you were in F2oC.
<br>
<br>
If you were aware the whole time then your experience could be likened to a WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dream), where you enter the dream world without falling unconscious.
<br>
<br>
I had a few experiences this morning and I was amazed at the dreamlike quality that I felt after I awakened, so I think I know where you are coming from.
<br>
<br>
As for moving on to F3oC (something I am still attempting myself), have a look at the first page of this thread:

So if I were able to transition into Focus 3 awareness, would I have access to the RTZ as if I were "out-of-body"? Is that how to get there Frank?

<section>
TryingOBE, that's exactly what I want if I can ever consciously project. I have all manner of tests in mind for when, and if, I can get into the RTZ.

Frank, that thought raises a huge question for me. I know I've beaten this experience to death in other posts, but it's all I've got, so bear with me. I have had one instance of OBE, involuntary, while I was wide awake and standing up. I wasn't sleepy at the time. But all at once "I" (my point of consciousness I guess) was behind and slightly above where the physical me was standing. Everything was crystal clear and perfectly normal, except for me! There is no doubt in my mind that I was in one place and my body was in another. Are you saying I wasn't really out of body? Color me confused!!

<section>
what frank is trying to say i think is that you are not ''out of body'' because you always are ''out of body'' your just shifting consciousness from a physical to an nonphysical state.

As far as I understand, the RTZ is F1oC. If you got to F3oC, you would probably have more interesting things to do other than fly around the RTZ. F3oC is the transition area, where you are able to meet people who have died and possibly bring back verifiable evidence. This is my understanding of the area, anyways.
<br>
<br>
As for getting to the RTZ, I imagine you could get there easier from F2oC, since that is what I am currently doing in my attemps to go the "other" way and hit F3oC.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Take a look at the sun. It rises in the east and sets in the west. You follow its movement from one point to the next and it appears to be revolving around us. This is obvious, because we can see it does. Unfortunately, it is us that is revolving around it.
<br>
<br>
Now, you project into the wider physical. I do not like using the term "real-time zone" because there is no such thing as "real" time and it is not a "zone". But we all kinda get what we mean so let's not complicate the issue on that score. So we project into the RTZ. You see yourself out of body. It is obvious you are out of body because you can see that you are. But what you are seeing is the equivalent of watching the sun revolving around the planet.
<br>
<br>
You have not actually gone "out" of body at all. You have simply taken a step "back", so to speak, from the front-line physical in terms of your current focus, into the wider physical. You cannot go "out" of someplace where you were never "in" in the first place. If someone moves their location from point a to point b, this logically presupposes the person was actually at point a to begin with. If I want to go out of one room into another room I have to initially be in that first room.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the body, we are not located in that first room, we are merely focused within it, as if from a distance, if you like. The analogy falls down rather quickly but imagine looking into room one from a distance through a telephoto lens, then you shift your focus to room two. In a sense, and only in a sense, this is what we are doing.
<br>
<br>
As I have said many times, people get
<i>
 body fixated
</i>
to the extent where their whole sense of thinking becomes relative to it. But a body is merely an objective representation of the accumulation of a particular set of expectations regarding the enactment of certain types of actions within particular areas of consciousness.
<u>
 It holds no other purpose
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
One of the most popular questions people ask me is, "Frank, what is the easiest way of me leaving my body?" You can't, there is no way at all you can leave your body. You can shift your focus of attention into the wider physical, you can shift it to Focus 2/3/4 but you cannot leave your body. There is no way you can step beyond the physical. The physical is an end result. Nothing exists outside of ourselves. Some people accept this but then start taking it way too far the other way and begin calling physical reality an illusion. I step short of that by a long way. Anyone who thinks physical reality is an illusion should walk into the nearest lamppost.
<br>
<br>
It's not that physical reality is an illusion, it's the
<i>
 notion of objectivity
</i>
that is the illusion. To understand what I mean by that you need to study the way the subjective translates into the objective, in terms of energy. This knowledge can be gained from Focus 4 and Focus 2 experiences. Particularly in regard to the way our perception creates our reality.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank, thanks for the reply. That makes sense, and seems to tie in with a comment "I" made while I was behind myself.
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
I was not pleased with my body at the time, and when my point of conciousness changed, the non-embodied "I" said: "It's only a biological machine." The unstated impression given was that I should already know that. Very strange experience!
<br>
<br>
Let me try an analogy. What I hear you saying is similar to, for instance, looking really, really closely at an insect. You are focusing in as closely as you can, trying to see every detail of that insect. While you're concentrating on the bug, your field of vision does not encompass the garden, or the sky, or the street nearby, etc. All those things are still there, you just aren't aware of them for a time. I know it's not exact, because there would still be a "you" point of conciousness, but is that sort of what you mean?
<br>
<br>
And let me ask one more, if I may. Again, this is a repeat, so forgive me in advance.
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I was on a plane and decided to do a bit of meditation. I never went to sleep (impossible with all the noise). But after a few minutes I began to see images of Native American hieroglyphics. They came slowly at first, one at a time, then started speeding up and crowding together, then gradually trickled back down until they stopped. It was exactly like turning a water faucet slowly on to full force, then just as slowly back off. I am assuming we flew over what I call a "place of power," sort of an energy vortex. There's another oen of these in Muir Woods (another story). Can you give me your impression of what that might be?
