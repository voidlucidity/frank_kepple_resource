Good day everyone.
<br>
<br>
I've never had the chance to try Hemi-Sync. I'm really intrigued by it and would simply like to know which programe would benefit a beginer like me. Essentially, what should I start of with.
<br>
<br>
They are expansive programs, so I would hope to get my moneys worth.
<br>
<br>
Thx in advance...                                                                  Paul

Depends what it is you want to do. If it's conscious-exit obe then Gateway Series Wave 1 is the best way forward IMO. Focus 10 (mind awake, body asleep) is a precursor to obe and I can highly recommend it.

Where could I buy it online that would ship to UK/accept UK cheques?

On the Monroe Institute website there's a list of UK dealerships.
