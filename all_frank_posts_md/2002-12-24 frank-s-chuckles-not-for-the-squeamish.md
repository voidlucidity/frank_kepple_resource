So Frank again puts on his flame-proof overalls, takes a deep breath and hits Send:
<br>
<br>
At the year 2000 World Women's Conference the first speaker from England stood up: "At last years' conference we spoke about being more assertive with our husbands. Well, after the conference I went home and told my husband that I would no longer cook for him and that he would have to do it himself. After the first day I saw nothing. After the second day I saw nothing. But, after the third day, I saw that he had cooked a wonderful roast lamb."
<br>
<br>
The crowd cheered.
<br>
<br>
The second speaker from America stood up: "After last years' conference I went home and told my husband that I would no longer do his laundry and he would have to do it himself. After the first day I saw nothing. After the second day I saw nothing. But after the third day I saw that he had done not only his own laundry, but all mine as well."
<br>
<br>
The crowd cheered.
<br>
<br>
The third speaker from Australia stood up: "After last years' conference I went home and told my husband that I would no longer do his shopping and that he would have to do it himself. After the first day I saw nothing. After the second day I saw nothing. But after the third day I could see a little bit out of my left eye."

As it's Christmas, here's another one:
<br>
<br>
A Martian couple and an Earther couple meet-up and are talking about all sorts of things. Finally, they get around to the subject of sex.
<br>
<br>
"Just how do you Martians do it?" the Earthers ask.
<br>
<br>
"Pretty much the same way you do," the Martians respond.
<br>
<br>
Discussion ensues and, finally, the two couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another.
<br>
<br>
The female Earther and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He's got only a teeny member which is about half an inch long and just a quarter of an inch thick.
<br>
<br>
"I don't think this is going to work," says the woman.
<br>
<br>
"Why?" he asks, "What's the matter?"
<br>
<br>
"Well," she replies, "It's just not long enough to reach me!"
<br>
<br>
"No problem," he says, and proceeds to slap his forehead with his palm; and with each slap of his forehead, his member grows until it is impressively long.
<br>
<br>
"Well," she says, "That's really impressive. But it's still pretty narrow...."
<br>
<br>
"No problem," he says, and the Martian begins pulling his ears.
<br>
<br>
With each pull, the Martian's member grows wider and wider until the extent of the measurement becomes extremely exciting to the woman.
<br>
<br>
"Wow!" she exclaims, at which point they both fall into bed and make mad, passionate love.
<br>
<br>
Next day, the couples rejoin their normal partners and go their separate ways.
<br>
<br>
As they walk along, the Earther male asks, "Well, was it any good?"
<br>
<br>
"I hate to say it," she says, "but it was pretty flaming wonderful. How about you?"
<br>
<br>
"It was OK," he replies, "but a little weird. The whole time she kept slapping me on my forehead and pulling my ears."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, that's it. Merry Christmas everyone.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
