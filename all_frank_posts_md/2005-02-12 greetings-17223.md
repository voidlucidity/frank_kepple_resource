<section>
Greetings! I found this website and board after buying Robert Bruce's book at a local Occult bookstore. I've actually had several OBEs, but not for quite some time, and so I inquired at the store about classes and books. The person I talked with just happened to be the one who teaches these classes, and recommended the book, so I bought it and started reading it that night. The next morning I had an OBE, which was really quite cool as I wasn't sure if I'd ever get out of my body again. So, now I'm working on meditation each night and trying to learn how to "build a bridge" between the astral and conscience levels. I'm confidant I'll be successful, but like many people I want it all *now* &lt;g&gt;!
<br>
Currently, I can get to the point where I feel myself become very light and I see flashy lights and I hear an occasional sound. But that's usually as far as I go with it; I'd like to learn how to achieve the next step which I assume is an astral projection. I also want to learn how to travel to higher Realms than the astral, and experience more of what's out there. Because of prior OBEs I do know there's Truth to this, so at least I don't have to fight any doubts. But getting to that next level would be most excellent. If anyone here has any suggestions I'd be quite happy to hear from you.
<br>
<br>
Thanks! And merry meet!

Hi Major Tom,
<br>
Thanks for your response! I'm don't think of myself as that expereinced or knowledgeable as of yet because OBE isn't something I can do at will. Most of th etimes I've been out its been a spontaneous thing, which is fine. I'm just trying to learn to do it at will, and then learn how to go to where I want to go. Typically, I play in the clouds or do something that seems pointless (whether it is or not I really don't know). The last time I projected I was able to help a woman who had just been killed during a bank robbery. I was lucid, and able to see and speak. And I wasn't in an overly "silly state," although I was just before I saw her leave her body. So, I'd like to be able to do more of that sort of thing; help people, find higher Wisdom for myself, and have fun as well. Â So, really, in my mind I have a ways to go and quite a lot to learn. But hey - its all good!
<br>
Thanks also for the book recommendations. I've read Monroe's first book - it was actually the first book on astral travel I read (that was like 15 years ago at least). Its a very good book for describing the excursions, but I didn't get any technical help from it. Although, I have discovered just reading about it can do a lot to help you along your way.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again, I look forward to exploring this board more!
