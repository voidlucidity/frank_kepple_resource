Last night / this morning I was dreaming along and then I became ultra aware that I was not in my body but travelling around in different areas of consciousness. I found myself in a house and I noticed an energy or spirit in the room with me moving around.  I could only notice a shimmering movement however, and I couldn't see it.  I realized I was out of body and travelling around between thought forms or areas of consciousness.  Since I couldn't see the energy or spirit I asked it to draw it's name in the air for me in glowing letters but nothing happened.  Then I sat down in front of a large mirror and asked it if it could show itself to me that way.  I was a little scared to look and realized this was probably part of the reason I couldn't see it, so I decided to just let go and trust.
<br>
<br>
As I looked into the mirror I saw myself and then suddenly I saw a 6 or 7 year old version of myself standing behind me.  I smiled and turned and could see him/me now and I began talking to him/me and asking about certain things and then I went into a discourse explaining a bunch of stuff I had figured out.  However, I realized he would not understand much of it and I told him that he would go back and wake up and likely not remember much of what I told him but that it would be ok.  We could meet again and talk later.  I thought he/me was pretty cute and very intelligent and it was the most fascinating thing I've experienced so far.  I the me now was tutoring the younger version of me.  This is the first time I've experienced this but I've heard of it before in Monroe's work.

Chris,
<br>
Wow!  I am envious of your experience (in a good way of course).  I know of someone who wanted to learn to play the flute...so he projected into the future and took lessons from his future self, and then came back and with some practice he was able to play just as he remembered learning.  Now I don't know exactly what is and isn't possible (as you pointed out to yourself that the other you would probably not remember much later), but I know we can split our consciousness up into infinite? peices...
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would be interested to hear more about what others have experienced in regards to this phenomena.  Thanks for your post (your new in the forum eh?)
<br>
<br>

There are an infinite number of "Astral Planes" and an infinite number of beings frequent them. You have to be careful that when you do come across them, you don't make false assumptions. The image could well have been a younger version of yourself. But you don't know whether it is your mind making that assumption, or whether the being itself presented that picture.
<br>
<br>
After much trial and error, I found that when you do find yourself in populated regions of the Astral, the best state of mind to adopt is an air of mild curiosity. Then you tend to attract others who like to help. Which is good because you can find out a *lot* of information that way. Otherwise you end up trying to work out what is going on around you for yourself. Which is extremely difficult, as nothing really relates to the physical. So you end up in a state of being puzzled and perplexed. Problem is, Scamps (as I call them) pick that up and begin teasing you; playing on your fears, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
It is perfectly possible on the Astral to learn to play any instrument, or to learn a language, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Technically, on the Astral, you cannot project into the "future" because there is no time (everything is infinite). But I admit it's a convenient way of looking at it from the point of view of the physical. With skill and practice, it is possible to project to populated regions where great music is played. There you are bound to find a helpful someone who can teach you.
<br>
<br>
Coming across the "someone" who can teach you, once you are there, is the easy part. The hard part is developing the ability to project and find such a place... and not just once, but with sufficient accuracy to do it time and again.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

No I'm not new to Robert's forum but I generally posted on the other older forum.  I like this one better though.  I've had a lot of other different types of experiences.  I once met my future self out of body. However, I had never met a past version of myself until this last time.  Who knows what's in store for the future.  In regards to knowing who you are dealing with out of body I'm fairly confident I always know who I'm dealing with.  The way this is done is to focus on the individuals energy or how they feel rather than how they look.  It's hard to describe but I've always had a natural ability to see through people in my daily life.  The moment I meet someone I somehow know stuff about them without anyone ever telling me.  I call this a "feel" for the person.  I've encountered creatures who try to impersonate angels or a family member or loved one but "feel" like someone completely different.  I'll usually yell at them to stop pretending because I know they are not the person they look like.  Their energy or feel is completely different.  So, if you can develop this talent it would help you I think.  Even if you can disguise your looks, you cannot hide your unique energy signature.

Chris, something you said made me think.
<br>
<br>
You said that you can get a feel for entities/people in general and know when they are misrepresenting themselves.  I tend to agree with that statement, in that I also read people rather well, and I certainly agree that in dreams/astral experience its particularly easy to do.
<br>
<br>
However, I have an experience that defies it (I think).  An advanced being in one of my dreams was demonstrating how to become invisible in the astral.  He disappeared right in front of me and then appeared again in slow-motion, kind of showing me how the trick was accomplished.  What i find interesting is that I was trying to do exactly as you discussed, trying to find/feel him by his energy when he was invisible.  No such luck.  I even knew psychically that he hadn't moved at all, but I couldn't sense it energetically.  (and that psychic impression I suspect was intentionally allowed by the being)
<br>
<br>
My question is, do any of you (who feel like Chris &amp; I that you have a good "radar") have experience with entities that are undetectable or unreadable?  My experience is too limited to draw any definite conclusions.  A stealth technology for the astral, hmm...

I know what you are talking about with regard to not being able to detect the entity by their energy signature.  Frequently my guides will come help me and I can hear them and feel their hands on my but I can't see them.  The guide will usually say something like, "focus Chris... just focus.".  After a few minutes of intense focus the guide will shimmer into existance before me.  When I say I have good senses for malignant energies I'm not necessarily saying they can't hide from me if they are advanced enough.  I think this would be a simple moving out of phase with your energy.  However, when they are in phase and visible or you are able to sense them, I don't think they can mask their unique energy signature and deceive you if you know what to look for... at least not the ones I've encountered so far.  However, the negative entities I've encountered so far don't seem very much evolved or advanced.  Who knows maybe more advanced entities can mask their true energy.  However, hopefully those more advanced entities have gotten beyond the need for negativity and/or they are not interested in us lower beings.
