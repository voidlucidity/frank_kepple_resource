I this can be looked at as an effect of doing energy work but I have been having this happen for years and so has my friend.  I have only been doing energy work for a few months and she has never done energy work. But...
<br>
<br>
Often as I am going to sleep my mind will drift a little I have have a hard time getting to sleep.  Then seemingly out of no where its like some on slaps me accross the face and my whole body jumps.  It is difficult to descibe how i feel afterwards.  Mildly confused, because it happened, but at the same time I feel..I dunno...whole.  Some what warm and fuzzy.  I never really gave it much thought until recently when it started happening again.  It's wierd but when it happens it almost feelings like I am falling back into the bed.  Like I was about an inch or two off of the bed and then all of a sudden I drop.  I wake up for just a split secound and then like I said often roll over and go to see.  I have tried to do other things recently when that happens but nothing ever comes of it.
<br>
<br>
Any thoughts.

There's a scientific name for this phenomena. A post about 6 weeks ago talked of the same thing and someone provided a link to some good info. I forget the exact details but you may come across it if you do a quick flip through some past posts.

This happens to me in spurts, like perhaps three times a week and then no longer for a month or two... if you do dig up that link I would be interested

Well I found the link ^^^.   But I would not describe in that manner.  For me there is no dream or vision of falling but only the sensation.  Sometimes actually feels like I am hitting the bed.
