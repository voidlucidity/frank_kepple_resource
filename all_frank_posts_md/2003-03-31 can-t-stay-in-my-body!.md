Check out this article, I found it interesting because while many of us desire to be OB, others have a tough time staying inside their bodies.

 I Struggle to Stay In!
 <br>
 by Phylameana lila Desy
 <br>
 Vast numbers of individuals and clustering groups of people are seeking ways to experience out of body, never mind that several of these people seeking to be out of their bodies are actually seldom in their bodies in the first place - more than 50 percent of their energetic fields are hanging out in the ethers....
 <br>
 <br>
 My personal experience is that for a major part of my life I had been out-of-my-body more than in it. And even now making conscious efforts to be more aware of my body and to actually be IN MY BODY continually I struggle with yanking myself back in. My spiritual nature is floaty. Grounding exercises help tremendously with maintaining a balance of our physical and spiritual bodies.
 <br>
 <br>
 For years I thought that being out-of-body equated with being an enlightened or more spiritual being. I have since learned (urr...remembered) that I AM already a spiritual being. Being here on the planet means that I have this unique opportunity to be housed within a physical shell. Why discard or disdain the physical house? Without our bodies we wouldn't be able to enjoy the physical pleasures such as eating or sexual intimacy among many other physical sensations. After all, how could the spiritual body devour chocolate??
 <br>
 <br>
 Out of body experiences done in a controlled fashion are safer and more fulfilling. Cherish your physical body as a place to return safely home to after the spiritual journey, not as a place to run away from.

Though I'm not sure where the writer is coming from when they talk about eating and sexual intimacy as being purely Physical pleasures. While there is no need to formally eat and drink, I have seen many people continue to engage in such activity. Plus the intensity of sexual intimacy that can be engaged in, makes the Physical version pale by comparison.
