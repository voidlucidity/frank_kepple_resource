Hello there!
<br>
<br>
I have just found you all today and wanted to say hello. I'm gonna read through your topics and hopefully contribute at some point.
<br>
<br>
I have had one OBE – when I was 8 years old at the dentist having some teeth pull under a general anesthetic. I suppose most people look down at what is being done to their bodies, but I found swinging on the pipes much more amusing! Then I swung right back into my body!
<br>
<br>
I also an astral projection experience when I was sixteen, but found my head stayed attached while my legs and body was floated up in the air. I was just hanging there upside down...

<br>
<br>
I forgot about my experiences until a couple of years ago, and I am building up the confidence to have another try. So I will be so nice to be able to talk about this with like minded people
<br>
