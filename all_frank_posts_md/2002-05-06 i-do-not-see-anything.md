As for seeing whilst projecting it's the same as you would do on the Physical. You simply open your eyes. On the Astral, obviously, you don't have any physical eyes to open, as such. But all you do is to think about opening your eyes and you will be able to see.
<br>
<br>
As for the rapid-heartbeat you are feeling, what you are probably doing is just activating one of the bodily energy centres that mystics, et al, call Chakras. There is something about a Heart Chakra that can be activated which gives similar feelings to what you describe.
<br>
<br>
I believe, from what people have said on this BBS, that I did the same once. Quite by accident, as it happened. But activating various Chakras is not the same as projection into the Astral. Which is probably the reason why you have reached your current stumbling block.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
