Last night while lying in bed I tried to use self hypnosis to give myself some suggestions to help stop smoking. I was counting backwards as I was relaxing and my breathing slowed. I then reached a point where I had this loud humming or buzzing sensation throughout my body. What happened next I am not sure if it was real or a dream. I was in the universe. I don't know what I saw.. maybe the end or beginning of it (the universe that is). Very strange to say the least. I did some searching on the web and ended up in this place because it seems like it makes the most sense explaining what happened to me. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Were you actually smoking at the time you gave yourself these suggestions? Because if you weren't then they could be a source of confusion. You can't actually manifest a "not". You may know what you mean in an objective sense but the subjective gets a bit tangled with this kind of expression. The subjective can only manifest an "is" not a "not".

Not to speak for Frank, but I think he's saying that your subconscious cannot process a "stop smoking" signal from you -- it can only process a "I am a non-smoker" or "I breath fresh air alone" or something along those lines.
<br>
<br>
More to the point of your question, it appears that the humming or buzzing you heard was the early stages of an "out of body experience".  You can check out Robert Bruce's treatise on OBE's at his website (www.astraldynamics.com), which will sort of give you an overview of what a lot of the folks in the forums here are talking about.  It's all very strange at first, but don't worry, it'll get stranger.
