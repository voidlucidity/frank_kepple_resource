Last night I think I had an obe but a strange one.
<br>
This is how it happened.
<br>
As a drifted into sleep, I told my self that I was out of my body (I been telling my self this for months now, with no results, until last night)
<br>
I wake up, but I feel something is not right, I am stuck some how, twist it, what's happening to me can't see a thing, is dark, but wait in my minds eye I see like a tube at the end of it, I see a colorful entity, very strange and alien, I get a little panicky don't know what's happening to me, I try to move but I can't, I try to relax I told my self I was out of my body sort of, I made a mental effort to call my wife for help, but can't.
<br>
I finally awake and get up, I want tell my wife what happen, all is still dark in my room except for the clock instead of red numbers they look orange and bigger like glowing, how strange I can't open the door, can't talk, what's happening to me?
<br>
And then bam! I was in my bed and awoke for real this time.
<br>
The experience of being out was so real that I did not realize that I was out; I wish I had light in the room to help e realize I was ob.
<br>
But can't complain I finally did it.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Your experience is very typical.
<br>
<br>
You suddenly find yourself "out" and instantly you feel very vulnerable. But that's not what the books tell you. The books are full of amazing stories of travelling here and there like it is as easy as getting on a jet plane. But that's just authors pampering to the capitalist needs of publishers.
<br>
<br>
Frankly, finding yourself "out of body" is rather frightening and confusing. But the good news is, the more you practice the more used to it your become.
<br>
<br>
Try to keep a cool head, try to stay emotionally neutral. This is very important otherwise you will begin actually meeting the objective representations of your fears head on. Then you'll start clamouring for "protection" and, before you know it, you will be like a number of rather unfortunate people who end up riding an Astral ghost train that never ends.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
