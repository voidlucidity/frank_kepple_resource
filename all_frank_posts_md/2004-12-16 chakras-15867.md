Months ago I decided to chant one spiritual words corresponding to a spiritual plane (physical, astral, etheric, causal ...) starting with the physical plane and working my way up. I have to say the results were good. Everything from an improve physical condition to clearer dreams and perception. I want to do the same thing with the chakras. Each month chant the mantra corresponding to a chakra starting with the base chakra. A friend told me it could be possibly dangerous or unsafe. Anyone has an advice?
<br>
Thanks for your help.

Unsafe? LOL

I went through a phase of activating the various bodily energy centres that mystics typically call Chakras. Had a whale of a time, it's immense fun. Although I'm not at all into the energy-work side of things, I still do activate these centres (purposely) now and again for the delightfully whacky feelings they give. I say purposely because I do feel various centres come alive during my projection practice. But they seem to come alive far more when you concentrate on individual centres specifically. My favourites tend to be the green followed by the yellow.
