I HAVE READ IN SEVERAL OUT OF BODY BOOKS THAT ASTRAL SEX IS A POSSIBILITY. I KNOW THIS IS A DELICATE SUBJECT BUT I FIND IT VERY INTRIGUING.  IS THIS SOMETHING WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION OR WOULD I BE WASTING MY TIME?

Not just a possibility but an actuality. I've been fortunate enough to experience the phenomenon a number of times and the Physical version pales by comparison.
<br>
<br>
Sex, within non-physical realms, as you might expect is more a meeting of minds rather than bodies. The act is especially sensual as you do not experience your own pleasure directly. You experience it through the other mind. They, in turn, experience their pleasure through your mind.
<br>
<br>
Because the pleasure you feel is directly proportional to the pleasure you give; and vice-versa; the minds get locked in an ever more pleasurable experience. When I first came across this phenomenon, the beginning stage felt very much like a Physical-style orgasm. I remember thinking, ho-hum I recognise this feeling, so what's new. However, the similarity very quickly ended upon my realising the orgasmic feeling was continuing to build in intensity... and it wasn't stopping!
<br>
<br>
I don't know if there is any formal "end" to the experience. I haven't managed to bear the sheer intensity of the feeling for long enough to see it through. Well, if it can be "seen through" that is.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

I have almost had astral sex a few times.  But I have a problem and it is the most frustrating thing!  Just as I am about to orgasm, I flip back to my body

And it happens every time - Just my luck!

I dislike using the word "sex" to describe this phenomena because of all the negative connotations that it has and because the experience seems to be much different than the act of intercourse as we know it in the physical.
