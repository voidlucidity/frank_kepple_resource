Hi
<br>
<br>
I would like to know what happened to me in my sleep.
<br>
<br>
This things happened at the same hour at night about 04:00 in morning.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly it woke me up, an enormous weight like something sett on me I couldn't´t move. Well it was scary. Then i was pulled out of my body and I saw with my physical eyes at the same time I was floating under the ceiling and watching my body and the figure that was floating above my body. (Two views at same time)
<br>
<br>
I tried to looked at this figure with my physical eyes but I couldn't´t turn my head.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The same thing happened to me two weeks later.
<br>
<br>
I would like to know what was that force, which paralyzed me??
<br>
<br>
P.S.: This happened after my request to see my spiritual guide?

Hi there,
<br>
<br>
what you experienced sounds like two phenomena that are fairly common. The first is sleep paralysis. That's when you were unable to move. It often happens to people in conjunction with OBEs.
<br>
<br>
The second is called dual consciousness. This means that your consciousness was split in two parts: one in your physical body and one in your astral body, while you were having your OBE.
<br>
<br>
I understand it was scary for you, particularly the paralysis. I suggest that in future you do a personal protection affirmation before you go to sleep. There are several ways to do this, but basically you surround yourself with a protective wall or light. Imagine that in your mind. This would make sure that during your OBEs you would not be endangered in any way and that in turn would also lessen the fear that you are experiencing. In time your fear will disappear and turn into enjoyment.
<br>
<br>
Good luck!
<br>
<br>
Michael

Hello:
<br>
<br>
What you are feeling are very normal projection states. The tremendous weight you think is pressing down on you is the sensation of feeling your physical body in a very relaxed state. The split awareness, in terms of seeing you viewing yourself from various perspectives, is all very normal. These sensations are something you just get used to after a while.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
