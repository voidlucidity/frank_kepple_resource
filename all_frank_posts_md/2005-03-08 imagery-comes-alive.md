During my attempts at meditative relaxing, I have noticed that imagery I have been thinking about will suddenly come
<b>
 alive
</b>
. Â What I mean is, if I am imagining a tree the leaves will start moving, rustling in an imaginary breeze that I did not consciously create.
<br>
Is this indicative of reaching a certain level of relaxation or even a particular focus level?[/quote]

I would guess so. When I meditate sometimes images will just fly by in my mind's eye for a quick second and then leave. They normally always have some sort of "theme" towards them.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Not sure on the relaxation aspect, but it is indicative of you reaching a particular focus level. In Phasing terms, you are shifting the focus of your attention to Focus 2 of consciousness. Within this area thought equals action so it is very easy to visualise with amazing clarity. Even if you previously thought of yourself as someone who was useless at visualisation.
<br>
<br>
So not only will you visualise a tree, for example, it's leaves will rustle in the wind and all that jazz. You may think you did not consciously create these minor details but this area of consciousness is so incredibly sensitive to the slightest thought, you can very easily create various aspects without [consciously] realising it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

It sounds like that sort of visualization moves from static to moving/changing because either your mind accociates the movement with the object so strongly, that it takes over and 'fixes' the image for you so that it more properly resembles the object or scene that you imagine or it changes simply because you cannot maintain the image well enough and the scene in front of you progresses along by association.
