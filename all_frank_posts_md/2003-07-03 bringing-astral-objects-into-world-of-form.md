HI -- -
<br>
<br>
I've read that some adepts have been successful at creating or finding things on the Astral and bringing them into the world of form, i.e., here-and-now.  In a way, we all do this, but we're not aware of it.  For instance, probably the piece of art or music you recently created was created by you on the astral first.
<br>
<br>
But some adepts can maintain awareness and intent to such a degree that they can do this deliberately.
<br>
<br>
While in an otherworldly state I've encountered objects that are weird and unusual.  An oddly-colored clock on my nightstand, for instance. Now I wonder, if I'd just grabbed that clock and phased back into ordinary consciousness, without a break (I've phased like this once before), would the clock have been brought into the "world of form?"
<br>
<br>
Are there dangers to doing this deliberately?  I suppose one would need to pick ones' objects very carefully.

I have attempted to do this several times without success. I've been there, so awake and alert holding some object or other, and slowly phased back to physical trying to "hold on" to the object as much as I could. But each time there's a kind of "mental blip" at the crossover point, and that's where I lose it.
<br>

Yours,

wouldnt you say that this is what magicians and witches etc are trying to do when they perform a spell in some circumstances? except, they do not project in order to do it.

Didn't that Bob guy do something like this? He would project and imagine he had a new car, and after a while, his neighbors  gave him one? I remember reading that somewhere...

(several months ago). But it was "astral magic", and she didn't as you say come back with the car from the higher planes hehe I don't think that taking back an object from the astral planes would be possible, as it has no physical existence and therefore cannot maintain itself in our plane, it would simply vanish again in a matter of seconds i guess.
