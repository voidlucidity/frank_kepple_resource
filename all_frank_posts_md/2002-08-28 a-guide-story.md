That was a good account. Although you made assumptions of your position. Which is not a good thing. It's always better to try and ask where you are rather than assuming things like you are still on the street in front of your house. You see, belief and expectation play a distinct role in scuppering the Astral-reality part of the experience. That's why I find it best to always maintain an air of mild curiosity, regardless of what happens.
<br>
<br>
Higher beings always radiate a pure kind of energy to a greater or lesser extent depending on what they think you can bear and what they know you want to expect to see. So if you want to see some kind of angelic figure, they turn themselves into what is your idea of an angelic figure and switch the radiation to high. With me, they approach casually with just enough radiation so I'll recognise them for the higher beings they are, and not mistake them for a normal resident of the lower planes. Because that's what they know I expect.
<br>
<br>
Problem is you lost it towards the end. Which is a very *easy* thing to do. You can always tell when you are losing it as things start to get into a kind of whirl. The different figure, the fireballs, and so forth, they all became what is known as a reality fluctuation. This is where you stop having experience of the Astral-proper (as I am sure you were at the start) and your surroundings are created as a result of your own emotional interplay.
<br>
<br>
What I found is it's best to recognise the moment you begin losing it and go back to the Physical. Problem is, reality fluctuations tend to sour the experience and they are very difficult to recover from while within the Astral. So if you zip back to Physical, it instantly gets you out of it. Then, chances are, you will be able to project back and continue as you were.

Yes, I understand fully what you are saying. But "expectation" and "belief" are very active constructs that, unlike in the Physical, have an instant effect on the Astral circumstances that surround you.
<br>
<br>
For example, I was with a guide once who took me to an underwater region for the first time. Trying to convince my protective sense of conscious awareness that I didn't have to breath underwater was one heck of a task.
<br>
<br>
After a few underwater sessions, I started to notice things that seemed odd, like, when we came out of the water my guide wasn't wet. But I was soaked. Reason being, I expected to be dripping wet. After all, I had just come out from under the water.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I began to notice was that when my guide entered and exited the water, he made not one ripple on the surface. Yet, with me, the water was splashing about all over the place. Again just as I "expected" it to do.
<br>
<br>
So, taking your situation, if you jump from the window to the street with your back to the house, as you turn around you will naturally expect to see the house. The problem arises that, when you are in this state of mind, you never know whether the image you are seeing is actually your house (viewed from the real-time zone) or whether it is a thought-form created from your sense of expectation.

<br>
That depends on your state of mind.
<br>
<br>
Please don't get me wrong, it probably was your house and I'm *not* trying to show you up or anything. The main aspect I'm trying to get across concerns belief and expectation.
<br>
<br>
You will hear me say a lot about the fact that "thought" is a primary energy. And thought-fuelled emotion, when released on the Astral, actually creates the circumstances that surround you in glorious 3D Technicolour. But even if you can remain emotionally closed, there is a "next stage" that you have to overcome.
<br>
<br>
That stage is all to do with belief and expectation.
<br>
<br>
I haven't spoken much about this, on the BBS, as what most people here need is clear guidance on how to overcome the basics. Which is mainly to do with keeping the emotional side of things under control.
<br>
<br>
But just going beyond the basics, for a moment, in order to try and demonstrate what I mean, my question to you would be: "Why did you descend onto the street?"
<br>

Major Tom, do you have dreams of obe's? After what definately felt like obe's I started having dreams of having obe's then the distinction between the two became blurred and I realized that the important thing was just trying to cultivate awareness and not to label which "state" I experienced.

I've been caught in some type of time distortion.
