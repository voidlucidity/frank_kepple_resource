Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
Here is an idea.
<br>
<br>
There seems to be several  people with unused Gateway CD's lying around the place for one reason or another.
<br>
<br>
How about we have a topic where people can sell their CD's. or maybe exchange or loan them if they want to? For money transactions, all people need is a free PayPal account:
<b>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.paypal.com
 </a>
</b>
. PayPal takes a couple of minutes to setup, and anyone can accept credit cards then very easily. Also, PayPal now works in US Dollars, British Pounds and Euro's.
<br>
<br>
What do you think?
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

if they were going to be loaned then would there be any problems morally from anyone if we could just send them over the net?  if i had them i would be willing to.  when i get them i will.
<br>
<br>
i'm not sure about the legality of this but believe it may be illegal, so obviously i'm joking about this entire post.  maybe we could jokingly upload them somewhere and jokingly tell only the people that actualy want them so we wouldn't have to worry about someone stumbling across it and jokingly put someone in jail.

but wouldn't it just be file sharing like imesh and the rest?

Greetings Fred,
<br>
<br>
I understand where you are coming from, but we must keep this entirely on the straight and level.
<br>
<br>
If someone purchases goods, then they are perfectly at liberty to sell those goods onto someone else on a one to one basis which is what i am suggesting - or of course to loan those goods as one would a book for example.
<br>
<br>
I do think that copying and distributing would be outside the law, ad not something we can morally or ethically condone.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your suggestions anyway

<section>
The first thing would be for someone to get their hands on a copy of the Gateway CD collection. If we could set up a collection and collectively own a single copy, we could pass it around to the people who contributed. It would only take a week or two to get a feel for if the collection is worth paying full price to get the collection. Naturally we could not encourage ripping the CDs to MP3 and passing those around on CD by way of e-mail, direct connect, snail mail, etc. We could make up a list of people in order of most contribution to least to see who gets the CDs first.

Greetings Tom!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I don't see any issues with having a "central" set of Gateway CD's between us, and for people to take turns with. How we organise it is a different matter. I think we only need the Wave 1 set anyway which costs about $99.  Better still, we could share an existing set that someone might have, and all contribute towards the cost.
<br>
<br>
Who would be interested, and how shall we do this?
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

<section>
that would be great.  not only would the owner get almost all of the money back for the set but the rest of us would pay only a fraction of the price.   we could send the money along w/ the cd's when they get mailed to the next person and just have it accumulate until it gets back home.  no gambling w/ the gateway money.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
the more people the more cost effecient it would be.  just make sure  the cd's are packaged and handled extremely well.  it's going to go through a few people before it gets returned and it would be nice to see them returned w/out a single new scratch.  it shouldn't be a problem w/ this group.  maybe we could decide who gets them first by  who wants them and the date they registered as a member on the forum?  who's got a set?

<section>
Yes, the Wave 1 set probably would be enough. As someone trusted by all of us, Adrian, would you be willing to set up a PayPal account for the purpose of collecting money to buy a set for us? It is the 22nd now. Sometime next month I would be able to put in $10 or $15 for some time with a copy of Wave 1 at some point in the future.

<section>
Greetings Tom,
<br>
<br>
I already have a PayPal account. We can't setup a seperate one because it needs to be associated with a bank account.
<br>
<br>
But I would gladly organise this. All we need to do is to gather our participants, and work out how much it will cost eachof us. If enyone else would like a "share", they just join in at that point pro-rata. If ti was a success, we could get the whole series maybe over time.
<br>
<br>
We need to discuss the logisics though. From what Frank has said (and if Frank is reading this perhaps he could confirm), it takes several months to achieve results. That means the fourth person could wait a year for a turn which might not be acceptable.
<br>
<br>
I like the ide very much, but we need to think about the details first.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
You are right. The logistics would take time to work out. A year does not matter to me, actually. Over a year we might be able to get more than one copy to pass around of the Wave 1. That would be more complicated. One copy to start with is simpler. We can complicate matters as we go along. Although we could not encourage it, obviously some of us might be tempted to make copies and pass the CD(s) along faster than a matter of months.

<section>
Yes this sounds like a great idea &amp; like Tom said-some of us are capable of making copies (for our own use) so the CDs could go around pretty quick. Although the file sharing that Fredhedd mentioned seems a quicker &amp; cheaper way. So there are 4 of us so far who want to do this? I know I'm last on the list. I've been working in my organic garden all summer &amp; haven't been here since last year after reading Bruce's book.
<br>
Also I don't have my paypal account anymore but I do have a C2it account-works like paypal. Or I can write a personal check, I'm in the US. OR, I could send you a WebCertificate for the amount-a WC works like a MasterCard that you can use online anywhere MC is accepted.

Yes, it did take me quite a while. But please don't take that as any kind of yardstick. I truly do not have any kind of natural gift for obe work. As such, I often have to really fight for even the smallest of gains. But that's how I always am with most things, and have long since accepted that.
<br>
<br>
I imagine a younger person more into the technology could, once they got the basic rundown from the Wave 1 CD, could easily create their own CD complete with sound effects, etc. Which I am sure would be equally effective.

Greetings Everyone!
<br>
<br>
Thank you as always Frank for your insight, and to Sandy for the suggested link.
<br>
<br>
I have another idea.
<br>
<br>
This excellent software for generating hemi-sync is free:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.bwgen.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.bwgen.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
And comes with a good number of presets, with a good many more available for a modest charge.
<br>
<br>
It would be possible to use an existing preset for theta work, and overlay the voice to an MP3.
<br>
<br>
What do you people think?
<br>
<br>
with best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

This is a great idea.  What ever choice is made up about copying and purchasing the CDs, the benifits  would definitly  be worth a group price.   So, we would use paypal to gather the money for purchasing and purchase the CDs form  the Monroe Institute which  are sent to a person.
<br>
<br>
After this person recieves the CDs makes a copy or whatnot then sends it to the next person.  And we could communitcate with eachother through  our personal E-mail or the E-mail on this site.
<br>
<br>
Or,.....  someone could set up a file share somehow for downloading capabilities.    Sounds like a good plan.

everyone will have their own specific time frame that they are going to need to be able to use the cd's enough to get anything from them.  however, looking at this group of people and seeing how smart everyone is i don't see any reason why any one of us would need more time then ....oh i dunno say about the same amount of time it would take to make a copy of a music cd.  if i'm correct and everyone here is that smart then it shouldn't take more than a month to pass them around to whoever wants them.

Hi all,
<br>
I have just searched my stack and found two Hemi-Sync CDs I would like to lend. Just how do i do that?
<br>
One of them is "The Visit" a guided meditation using the Hemi-Sync tones. The other one is called "Transcendence", It has both guided and unguided meditations using the usual tones. I like the unguided "Transcendence" better, but to each his/her own.
<br>
I mostly now use Holo-Sync "The Dive and Emersion" CDS now as I have found them more induceive to phasing (for me).

The problem was that we cannot talk too openly about copying and distributing copies of copyrighted material. The "Brain Sync" or however it is spelled is okay. They annoy me and I think of it as "Brain Sink" instead. Copying the CD outright or copying it to wav form would not compress it. I heard that MP3 forms even with comparatively high kbits do not work because the inaudible portions are removed. In they can't be heard, though, how can they be effective when played for the ears?

I wondered if Mp3s were as good as the orig cd's I have found quite a few MP3s available for sharing but there is a limit to the kbps or Quality they are avalable in, I am thinking that they lose something when shared with a program like kazaa because it limits the kbps. But when a CD is copyed or Burned at home you can get a pretty good quality Copy. Does that make sense?
<br>
Anyway I would be willing to contribute to a shared set. But we don't want to go and do anything we shouldn't be doing

<section>
When I copy books on tape to my computer, I record them through my sound card directly to MP3 at 32 kbits / second. When I copy music, I use 192 kbits / second. These days, when I copy hemispheric synchronization sorts of things to MP3 I do so at 256 kbits / second. It fills up hundreds of megabytes, but that seems insignificant. What matters is that a wav file records (on my computer, at least) at 1411 kbits / second. I cannot tell the difference between my wav and my MP3 versions, and there is nothing in the theory which I can point to as an explanation for why MP3 files even as low as 64 kbits / second should or should not work. In fact, I have purchased a wav file which was over 20 minutes and around 2 megs. It had been from MP3 of some sort before it was zipped and e-mailed to me. It was supposed to work, anyway.
<br>
<br>
Aside from the next month, I'm just waiting to hear from Adrian how and where to send some money for a shared Wave 1. Even so, I don't really expect it to work for me even if I were to get my hands on a copy.

<section>
Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
First of all - thanks to Donna for getting the ball rolling with that very kind offer
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
We need a definite plan here, and we must not be seen to breach any copyright laws! I am very keen to ensure that everything we do here is above board. Of course, what you do with the CD's in your hands is your own affair, providing I know nothing about it!
<br>
<br>
I think what we need is a register - just a forum topic that I will lock in place will do - of all available CD's that people are prepared to loan or sell.
<br>
<br>
Now clearly, the person loaning should not have to pay the postage costs of sending them to the borrower. So the first think I propose is that the borrower pays the postage costs. If everyone has a bank account and credit card this is all very simple using PayPal:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.paypal.com
 </a>
</b>
<br>
<br>
PayPal is completely free to register, and it means that we can pay each other by credit card in US Dollars, GB Pounds or Euro's. PayPal is a very useful service, and everyone should consider an account. Please note, to accept credit cards, you need to register for the Premiere membership - not the basic one.
<br>
<br>
We can communicate via Private Messaging between interested members.
<br>
<br>
Again - I must stress - the forums cannot encourage or be party to any illegal copying, but I am not interested in what people do among themselves or with the CD's in hand. Interpret this as you will, but please note what I have said.
<br>
<br>
This is looking
<b>
 very
</b>
useful!
<br>
<br>
Lets keep on discussing this, and lets get this moving!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

There are so many members on this forum, I'm sure a few of them might donate to this or other causes.  Personally, I don't think I'd participate in the shared CDs idea.

Hi all
<br>
I think Sandy and I are working this thing out pretty well. I checked out Pay Pal and it seems OK. I am fortunate enough to be part owner of a business with an internet site. We take Visa and Master Card. I would appreciate pre- payment of the postage (for a return envelope too, which will be included). I will send this proirity mail after the payment for postage is received and allowing for delivery time and a two week loan period should have the CDs returned to me in about a three week period.
<br>
There will, of course, be no charge for this "loan", only the prepayment of postage, and mutual trust that materials will be sent and returned.
<br>
I don't know what type of players you all have but I have saved a copy of these CDs to mine.
<br>
If anyone can offer a better method for these loans, please do.

I have a meta-music file called 'Flying Free'. It's a guided meditation/lucid dreaming type of thing designed to induce the feeling of flying.
<br>
<br>
It's about 43 minutes long and 40 mb. If you guys want it I could send it to you, but I think a lot of email accounts have an attachment limit. If anyone has MSN I could send it to you over that. Add me to your list, my name is
<a class="bbc_email" href="mailto:thebeatgoesononon@hotmail.com">
 thebeatgoesononon@hotmail.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
Or, I could snail mail you a burned cd of it for free if you like. Just PM or email me.

Hello all !!!
<br>
<br>
This is my first post on your great board.  The experience, knowledge and helpfulness of all your members is quite commendable.  Thank you for letting me participate.
<br>
<br>
I for one would be greatly interested in a revolving CD exchange / trade.  Please add my name to the list of interested parties.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Monroe CDs are a bit cost prohibitive to most (including myself) and would be a great way for people to "try before they buy".
<br>
<br>
I suggest for those who would be tempted to make copies, Mp3's etc that they could ease their conscious by directly buying other products from TMI or making donations to them to reward their efforts.   For those who opt to buy more of the TMI products to support them:  These products could also be shared with other participants in the CD share/exchange program.  Thus we could have an ever evolving, fresh supply of "mind materials" for all.
<br>
<br>
If we could do this it would also be quite good if we had a feedback area to discuss our results, tips etc.  A rating system on the different CDs would be quite helpful as well IMHO.
<br>
<br>
Would anyone be open to a book trade and exchange as well?
<br>
<br>
Thanks and regards,
<br>
<br>

Perhaps the Resources section of the forums would be a good place to put this. We could keep track of accummulated money, books, CDs, and other similar training materials. It is just a matter of getting started.
<br>
<br>
I agree that often when I am given a chance to try the ideas and products of specific people, it is likely that I will go to them to buy directly. Most of the time, though, it is a waste of time and resources such as Suneye. Then it makes me happy to know that I have not actually paid full price.

I got out this AM.  I've been listening to 1 of the 2 CD's from Donna every night when I go to bed. I don't know if I go OOB or if I just fall asleep but I'm awake the whole time the guy is talking &amp; then right at 'that' moment, I either fall asleep or go OOB but I don't remember dreaming or anything the next day.
<br>
<br>
Well yeasterday I got the CD from themadness. I listened to it while I was making supper so I would know what to expect, then I listened to it in bed at night &amp; it was the same thing in the AM as with Donna's.
<br>
<br>
So I'm thinking, I'll listen to it in the AM. DH's in the shower, I'm laying in bed waiting for him to get done, I listen to the CD from themadness &amp; I don't remember hearing the whole thing of what the guy says but 45 minutes later when the bathroom door opens to wake me up, I'm laying there recalling this:  I was outside jumping higher &amp; higher, I see some people who want me to stop &amp; do something for them &amp; I say no because this is really important to me (I normally stop everything I'm doing to help others out), I jump real high &amp; feel myself falling backwards, I'm thinking to myself I hope I don't end up breaking my bones &amp; ending up in a hospital, next thing I know I'm in a hospital, on a gurney in a hallway, 1 nurse is trying to put headphones on me &amp; I'm wondering if it's a meditation CD she wants me to listen to, there's another nurse doing something with my lower body,  they both leave, I get off the gurney, stumble into the nearest room &amp; lay on the bed, then I wake up from it all &amp; I'm laying in my own bed.
<br>
<br>
SO, I think the clue here might be to set your alarm clock for 45 minutes before you normally get up, and listen to one of the CD's then.
<br>
Also, I felt really refreshed &amp; relaxed like they say you should, It's such a wonderful feeling.
<br>
Thanks Donna &amp; themadness &amp;everybody else here. If it wasn't for this forum this might never have happened.

Oh I don't like to fill the board up with personal messages but Donna, there's no hurry, whenever you have time is fine with me.
<br>
<br>
I was using my son's CD player for these CDs. Well yesterday I bought one for myself, I got the Sony with the Streetwise headset, anyway I put one of the CDs in it &amp; my son showed me what all the buttons are &amp; I adjusted the volume &amp; had it all set up, put it on the bed &amp; when I went to go to bed, there's DH listening to it-now he doesn't beleive in all this stuff but when the Cd was almost done, he gave it to me, I asked if he was dreaming &amp; he said yeah, I asked if he was flying or falling in the dream &amp; he said he was falling, I told him it was an OBE, I don't know if he believes it or not but I'll have to get my son to try it now.
