Okay I have one major question about guides.
<br>
<br>
I appear to have a guide, but I have never actually see him, at least not that I can remember.   He also appears to be an elemental, or at least that is what was suggested on the limited knowladge I was able to provide.  This particular entity is very old, very strong, and has never lived a physical life.  More directly put, when my hypno-therapist asked if the energy we encountered was alive or dead I responded with, "He never was".
<br>
Now there has been several times when my therapist has asked for me to call in a guide or angel to help get through certain things.  Every time she has done this I have or tried to leave my body.  This has happened every time with the exception of once where this same energy tried to pull me out rather forcefully, but let go when told to do so.  My feeling at the time was that he was rather frustraited and had desided I was giong wether or not I wanted to.  This has led me to believe that for some reason or another instead of my guide coming to me I MUST go to him.
<br>
<br>
The question is here.&gt;  So in short, is it common for a guide for to be unable to present themselves when asked for, but instead an individual needs to go to them when help is needed?

If you are unsure, the key thing to do is not to guess or (worse still) to make possibly profound and deeply moving decisions on very limited information... but to keep asking for more clarity.
<br>
<br>
For example, I'm working on trying to open a channel of communication with my regular guide, Harath, whilst I am in the Physical. There have been times of late where I'd sense his presence in my mind but it was all very indistinct.
<br>
<br>
But gradually, day by day, by successively asking for clearer and clearer signals, I can now communicate fairly well. Okay, in the thick of my day I can lose the sensation of contact; and it takes me about 15 minutes of feeling around in the dark, so to speak, in order to regain the thread. But that's way better than I could achieve a couple of weeks ago, say.
<br>
