<section>
First, let me qualify myself by saying that I am a 50 year old professional and not prone to fantasy. On Nov.20th 2001, I had the most profound experience that I have since come to understand as an astral projection or obe. This experience was spontanious and I was fully concious.
<br>
I went to bed on Nov. the 20th 2001 extremely tired and with an agravating headache. Although tired, I could not go to sleep. I tossed and turned for hours. At approx. 2:30am I began to hear a very pronounced sound in my ear, that sounded like a moving helicoptor rotor. This sound was irritating and disconcerting only adding to my insomnia. Finally I laid on my back with my eyes shut and was instantaniously in an upright position suspended. All me around me were bright shinny golden round objects that looked alot like xmas tree ornaments. I felt great, ecstatic really and experienced no fear. I reached out and grabbed one of the objects in order to examine it. Curious about this environment, I threw the object down past my feet. It stopped about 30 feet below me suspended. As I looked down I was amazed to see a universe of these objects that spiraled like stars into an infinite space. I believe my wife laying beside me moved or made a noise at this point that brought me back to bed. I was still fully consious. I attemtpted to repeat this  but could not. Frustrated, I decided to try sleep again. I closed my eyes again and now was flying near a mountain. There was a cave at the base of the mountain that I was attempting to enter. I tried several times but could not enter the cave. It was very dark and a little gloomy. I noticed two beings standing at the entrance of the cave. These beings reminded me of biblical saints. I landed and as I approached the two beings they began to growl and hiss at me, looking a little demonish. I instinctively raised my arm and shot fire from my hand incinerating one then the other. Next I was back in bed, fully concious, however, I was half way in my body and half out. It was a very good feeling albeit strange. i tried to wake my wife but my hand seemed to go thru her leg. In an instant i appeared to be floating above myself. I looked up at the ceiling and was instantly flying in deep space. i thought for a moment that i might have died, and in that instant I became aware of my breathing. Satisfied that I had not died, I turned my full attention to this experience. I felt great. In the distance I could see an object coming in my direction, so I flew toward it. As it approached I noticed it was a blue and silver flying saucer. I landed on top of the craft and was just riding with it. I instinctively knew that there were two beings in the craft and I could hear their thoughts. I saw a planet in the distance and as we approaced the planet I jumped from the craft and began to fly over the surface of the planet a few hundred feet up. I saw there a large city built among the trees. There were many brightly colored buildings that protruded at different levels above the trees but mostly obscurred by them. I began to descend and I felt with after thought that i was being directed to a certain location. I landed on my feet on a narrow cobblestone road. to my right and left were two story stone buildings. I could hear the sound of happy voices making conversation with one another in the distance. I turned to look behind me and say a young man who appeared to be working on a guide wire for a pole. I felt compelled to tell him that i was a visitor. He just schrugged me off and acted unconcerned. My voice felt muffled and a little dificult to talk. I asked the man if might know where I was supposed to go. He said I think you should go down that way and went back to work. I started walking. The street ended at a door. As I began to open the door a large shaggy dog came up from my right, startling a little. The dog was not of this planet but very friendly, so I petted it for a second then went on thru the door. As I entered the room there was a hospital gurney to my right with one of those big alien dogs sitting opn it. Behind the dog partially obscurred was a tall thin man in a lab coat who appeared to be treating the dog. I could not tell for sure but the man looked a little alien. At any rate I did a double take as I walked past. The back wall of the building was open exposing the lush green countryside. there was a lake about 50 yards away. To my left were what appeared to be kennel cages. As I walked toward the rear of the building, I stepped in dog poop. looking down at my foot I noticed that i didn't have any shoes on. Also I noticed a young boy around 10 sitting to my left with his back up against the kennel. I thought the lake out the back would be a good place to wash my foot off, however, there was an alligator in the middle of the lake. Jokingly, I asked the boy if he wanted to watch me wrestle an alligator, (I knew that nothing could hurt me in this place). The boy said that he would like that and followed me toward the lake.The boy had unusual looking hair that swept across his forehead to his cheek. As we approached the lake I saw two lizards about a foot to a foot and a half long. When I got within a few feet of them they began to hiss and growl at me. I took another step and the lizards turned into young men. One of them stood directly in front of me with his hands on my shoulders looking directly into my eyes, the other stood to my left. They were both dressed alike, black sweeter dark or black britches, with the same hair as the boy. In a moment I was back but not completely in my body. I was half in and half in the mattress. I slowly merged with myself while this beautiful music played in my ears. I layed there fully concious for a few seconds listening to the music, then I got up and recorded this experience. It was 3:40am. I would like any input that anyone can give me that would relate to any part or all of this experience. I would also be interested in communicating with anyone that has had a similar experience

Ello,
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean.  It's one thing to read and research projecting but until it happens...you really have no idea.  I would suggest trying to develop this ability, and if projecting isn't your forte, the energy benefits, especially health wise are great.
<br>

Wow, what an incredible experience!  I'm impressed that you instinctively knew you were in no danger.  I have had many short obe's but yours sounds like a full length movie!  Are you planning to develop your ability further?  You should!

You visited what is commonly called the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Such experiences are very common for people who have the ability to project their sense of consciousness to these regions of awareness. The Astral is an infinite place populated by all manner of beings and forms. On what are termed the "lower regions" you tend to come across people and places that can be very earth-like. It is said the higher up you go things start getting more abstract but, as yet, I have only managed to project into the lower regions. Once you learn to control the process you can very quickly build a catalogue of such experiences.

I'm a new member today. My name is Jeffrey Everett and I live in Fairfield, Iowa USA.
<br>
<br>
Hi Scott -- Your experience was wonderful. I've had many such experiences. They started when I was about 6 years old and continued until a few years after I married. A Samaveda Pandit described the type of experience you relate to be a Kundalini uprising. I now tend to completely agree with him. If I were to express my way of thinking, I might say something like; the two guards you zapped could very well have been an astral representation of two nerve channels you spontaneously opened (with the Kundalini energy).
<br>
<br>
I did have several cave experiences, all of which were *very* interesting. One cave experience immediately came to mind when I read yours. I was moving across a pleasant pasture when I came to a mountain. At the base of the mountain (in front of me) was a cave which I walked into. The first 20 feet or so were white-washed. As I went further in the brush strokes of the white washing diminished until there was bare rock. At that point the light was diminishing and I came to a stop in front of a rectangular opening in the cave-floor. It was too big to step across and went from wall to wall. I looked inside, there was nothing, nothing at all, it was profoundly empty and I didn't want to go there. I wanted to go on but felt unsure so I went back outside where a 6 inch silver colored ball that looked like weightless mercury was floating around. I grabbed it and it turned into a crab . There's more but I won't go on.
<br>
<br>
I have received the impression from my cave experiences that caves are passages to other environments. I once went into a cave (with steps!), led by 2 Lamas. They led me down a long way into a small chamber. They had me get into a large heavy stone coffin. I got in and they left. After an indeterminent period of time I became inquisitive so I pushed the heavy lid off and got out. My eyes had dark adapted and I could see a different stair-cave going up out of the chamber, so I went up that one and eventually came into a carved stone, pillared room, then a stone balcony. I looked out into the night sky was astonished at the starry scene before my, all of it conscious! Clear and beautiful, and quite populated!
<br>
<br>
One of the more interesting experiences I'd like to relate involves just being next to my body. I laid down and spontaneously clicked (for lack of a better description) over to my "other" body. For the first time, I realized I was completely dual. I was in the physical body, blood pumping, lungs working, and feeling it IN that body. I was also floating beside my body trying to look at it, yet all I could see was an intense white fire surrounding it. The environment I perceived in my (remote) presence was different in that light emanated from all objects (the room I was in). The objects I perceived had no physical substance other than looking like a solid glowing mist. The quality of the light was different than normal light, conscious light, light and color as an enlivenment of the matter of that "light" world. All this "activity" stimulated an other person in the house, who floated over in her dream body to see what it was all about. I could she she was in a dream by the misty gray-ness of her form, and its closeness in appearance to her physical form. I don't know why, but I told her to go to the kitchen, and she did.
<br>
<br>
I had experiences like this nightly for a period of about 15 years, but I never met anyone else who had them, so I learned to keep quiet. Now, quite a few years later, these kinds of experiences are being talked about, that's GREAT!

 I can assure you that you are in good company here!
 <br>
 <br>
 There are man (projector)made structures in the Astral, e.g. Temples, that various people, Orders, etc., build for themselves and fellows for use as meeting places in the Astral. I know of the existence of just such a place, and which has an entrance hewn out of rock. One day in the future, when enough people here can project reliably, it would be great to create an Astral meeting place. Using symbolism, people should be able to project straight there.
 <br>
 <br>
 Hope you fing plenty of enjoyment and value here

 I felt EXACTLY the same for a period of 20 years. It's amazing how you just learn to keep quiet! I married for the first time quite late in life and my wife would often ask, "Did you sleep well honey?" And often I couldn't help but chuckle. Thinking, oh my gosh, if only she knew.
 <br>
 <br>
 One day I just started talking about it gradually, in conversation. Now, rather than asking if I slept well, she asks, "Meet anyone interesting last night?"

 I just wonder how many there are of us in the world?

 Hi Debbie,
 <br>
 With regard to your question, I have been busy over the last few months getting info about this subject while actively albeit without any success attempting to duplicate the experience. I feel strongly that my experience was directed because I was not actively trying to project, also, I didn't feel that I had much if any control over where I was going during the experience. I have since had a few lucid dream experiences that I believe have given me some answers. In the meantime, I am attempting astral projection daily. I do feel my energy level increasing, so I can only continue to try.
 <br>
 Thanks for your inquiry,
 <br>
 Scott
