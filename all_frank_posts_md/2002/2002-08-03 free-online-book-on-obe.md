I just dug up that link for a friend about twenty minutes ago - haven't visited Peterson's site in months.
<br>
<br>
I like his style, he's one of my faves.

I've read this before.
<br>
<br>
The book gives a good account of the basic challenges to be overcome. Definitely worth a read IMO.
<br>

Yours,
