<section>
Hi Guys,
<br>
<br>
As some of you might have read on my post under Jeff's "Guide" topic last week, I've been experimenting with Automatic Writing lately. I started to find that I don't even need to be in trance state - it's simply a matter of holding the pen lightly between my thumb and forefinger, lifting my arm off the table so I have no control, and simply letting the words form themselves.
<br>
<br>
I'm happy to say that I've made contact with my guide - and this time I'm sure! Her name is "Sereerer" (wierd huh) and she was last incarnated on earth in the 1880's in Melbourne. (I queried this - I live there - and she responded: "Miserable Melbourne. I assure you, I'm certain") She seems a lot of fun, and has a very cheeky sense of humour. She tells me we will meet soon in the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, what I really wanted to share with you all is a "conversation" we had today in regard to my contacting other entities to speak poetry and stories through me. It assured me that she is definately one of my guides and she has my highest good in mind. This is copied straight out of my notebook...
<br>
<br>
Meg: Sereerer, is it possible for me to receive poetry in this way?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Yes, but heed my warnings.
<br>
<br>
Meg: Will you give me these warnings?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Yes. My name is not Sereerer, but Satan.
<br>
<br>
(I freaked out then!)
<br>
<br>
Sereerer continues: Not meant to scare you Meg, it's meant to help you. I'm just making a point.
<br>
<br>
Meg:Thank you! Point well taken! Does this mean I'm not ready yet?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: No
<br>
<br>
Meg: What can I do to make receiving poetry safe for me?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Read it over and over when you want to. Strict learning seems best for you, Meg.
<br>
<br>
Meg: Read what?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Learn these words.... Assist my highest good, my nicest friends. Free me to create in your name the language never needed in your lifetime. Rescue me from those who wish harm on me. Let only exemplary examples of literature flow form my hand. Feel me finding my flowing, sender. Illustrate your talent. Thank you my friends.
<br>
<br>
Meg: Thank you, Sereerer. Anything else?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Yes. Light a candle in the name of Sereerer to protect you.
<br>
<br>
Meg: What particular words should I say when I light the candle?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: No matter about what you say.
<br>
<br>
Meg: thank you. Anything else I need to know?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: No. Except that we are with you.    Sereerer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
All of this appeared in my notebook in two different sets of handwriting. I'm not scared, but I am feeling a little overwhelmed by it all. Anyone got any words of advice as to where I ought to take things from here? Any comments? Anything?!
<br>
<br>
Thanks, lovely people.
<br>
<br>
Meg

Wow.
<br>
If this happened to me, I would take a while to let it sink in and get comfortable with what you are about to do. Then and only then would I proceed, and definately use the protection prayer first and every time that you undertake this sort of work.
<br>
Keep us posted on how you get on, it sounds very interesting.

Take care,

<section>
Definately. I just did a search on this site to see if anyone else had something to say about this subject...It seems as if the concensus is that automatic writing and ouija board both have pretty bad reputations in terms of attracting negative entities. I don't want to get messed up in anything I don't have full control over. I can see from my previous experiments that this is true ie. one saying they were my dead grandfather; another time I kept getting the words "leave terry" (my husband) over and over.
<br>
<br>
But given what I explained above, I don't see how this entity could mean me harm - she was so clear about the dangers of automatic writing and about the fact that I need to protect myself from negative entities. I mean, she even gave me a cheeky demonstration of what I could be up against: "My name is not Sereerer, but Satan" !
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your comments, Rich

<section>
Hi Meg, you're getting some great results there, keep up the good work!
<br>
Basically, I would try not to worry about negative people/spirits. I have done some experiments in the past with ouja boards etc (although NOT automatic writing yet).
<br>
With these methods, you will always occasionaly attract a negative influence, but all they're trying to do is scare you. Dont be, just tell them your not interested and end the session, they will eventially get bored. You will quite soon be able to tel the difeence between a spirit who is genuine and another who is mucking about.
<br>
As soon as I hear someone claiming to be Satan though, I cant help but yawn, that's a typical attempt to try to provoke some fear, just ignore it.
<br>
Satan....um ok, of course you are!
<br>
<br>
People who let themselves get scared by crap statements like 'I AM SATAN' etc leads to all the hysteria surounding ouija boards etc. Really it just takes a bit of common sense to be able to recognise bovine excrement when you see it! (just as in our world)
<br>
<br>
You're guide is giving you some good advice there about looking out for yarn spinners and timewasters. Bullshiters can be annoying as they waste your time when you want to get on with talking with some genuine guides!
<br>
I think your guide will continue to help you with all aspects of your communications.
<br>
I think I will give this a go as well....
<br>
Good luck and keep us informed with your progress!
<br>
<br>

<section>
I just thought of an interesting variation of auto writing, how about instead of pen and paper, what about the keyboard and moniter.
<br>
Just type what pops into your mind and see where it leads you!
<br>
I'm sure it would lead to some results!
<br>
<br>
Mind you, I suppose you would miss out on the different handwriting styles that spirits can manifest through you, like what Meg has found. It would be a shame to miss out on that.
<br>
<br>
Still, I might try it as an alternative method!

<section>
Here are the results of my first sessionwith auto-writing, using the keyboard.
<br>
<br>
I just relaxed my mind totaly and let the words come to me.
<br>
<br>
I don't know yet if this is an actual dialoque with any sort of guide or if it is simply me having a dialogue with my subconcious mind and imagination.
<br>
<br>
Of course as others will tell you, the astral is just on the other end of your imagination so if you keep listening to the messages coming through eventially they will become clearer and clearer until you are in no doubt that it IS a guide.
<br>
For now, I think that my dialogue below is more of a subconcious dialogue with myself, but you never know, its certainly a good start.
<br>
See what you think of it anyway:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, not bad for a first attempt. I will stick with this one and see if there's any progress, as I say, I cant really say for now whether it is a subconcious dialogue or somthing more, only further sessions will be able to verify this! I have no doubt though that with practice I will make contact for sure at some point as I have done in the past using the ouji method.

<section>
That is very interesting. An excellent, clear message. I have been trying auto writing on and off for a while but with little success so far. This is strange for me (and a little frustrating) as I can 'feel' my guides around me and get quite a few 'messages' for those around me through thoughts etc.
<br>
I would love to move forward to auto writing next so's I can get some good information through.
<br>
But what I have learned so far is that a good prayer of protection is of the utmost importance in stopping the 'less desirable' through. Since I have made contact, I have used a prayer constantly and never been bothered by a 'negative'.
<br>
Move at your own pace Meg, they will always be there for you as they are very patient.
<br>
Good luck and keep us informed of your progress.

i dunno how scared i m about trying to communicate w/ my guide(s).  i believe i'm more stubborn and won't actually try to until i can consciously exit, consistently.  i want the first time i communicate w/ them to be face to face so to speak.  it's tempting though.  a good portion of the day i do spend listening for things, but i don't provoke conversation, i just kinda listen.

<section>
Interesting you should bring that up, fredhedd. I am certain I have got her name wrong - though she responds to it when I "call" her. However, she won't tell me what it is right now - says that she wants us to meet "face to face, so to speak". She tells me she has been with me "since you started the night travels" so I think to meet her in the astral is the real point of this.
<br>
<br>
Lots of interesting things have happened since I made that first post (In fact, I think I'm going a bit overboard... I get this image of her rolling her eyes and saying "It's bloody Meg again!") Yesterday we spoke more about the poetry stuff.
<br>
-
<br>
Sereerer: Receive Minerva. She wants to tell you a story.
<br>
<br>
Meg: Who is she?
<br>
<br>
Sereerer: Friendly spirit. She wants to meet you to share her story.
<br>
-
<br>
Anyway, I thought this was interesting because my husband remembered Minerva as a character form Roman Mythology. Turns out she is like the greek Athena, who among other things was a patron of poetry and "letters" - particularly of women. It is also the name of a publishing house.
<br>
<br>
I don't feel ready yet, though...give me a week or two..!
<br>
<br>
trippy.

<section>
Thats right Meg,
<br>
Minerva is the daughter of Jupiter and Juno, and is the Roman equivilent of the Greek Athena.
<br>
Minerva is the patron goddess of victory, greatness (roman virtues), arts, poetry and excellence.
<br>
<br>
I suspect the spirit that wants to channel through you has chosen this name for herself as she thinks of herself as a great poet perhaps!
<br>
<br>
Well, you'll be able to judge for yourself soon enough hopefully!

Frank - I've found  it works both ways,  as long as you are deliberate in directing your question to your guide, instead of it being part of your regular thought process. I usually prefer to write my questions down, though - otherwise there are too many loose answers and clarifications floating around the page, and no context to put them in.

Maybe you should download A Lawyers case for the afterlife available on this site. Look at the Ouija Board section, so you will know what signs to look for, and where these beings may come from.

<br>
Hi ,
<br>
I was wondering how you could not be sure if it is your subconscious or your guide that wrote the words.
<br>
Do you write down things that you hear in your mind or your fingers press the keys without your own will?
<br>
In other words, is it you or some entity who writes down the words?

<section>
[]MEg:[/b] I just recently wrote a bit of inspired verse that spurred me to look around for info on automatic writing.
<br>
<br>
In your original post the following line caught my interest
<br>
<blockquote id="quote">
 <font face='"Arial"' id="quote" size="1">
  quote:
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
  Sereerer: No. Except that we are with you. Sereerer.
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
Have you inquired as to the identity of "WE"? In a later post you mention Minerva. Who else is queuing up?
<br>
<br>
In case anyone is interested here is a slightly edited (mostly for rhythm) version of the bit I wrote.
<br>
I wrote it while  meditating on the identity of the divinity closest to me at this moment after reading a few posts relating dark with evil.
<br>
As for copyright "Use it if you wish use it with respect use it with love"- My addition "mentione me if you use it in part or in whole"
<br>
<br>
---
<br>
For me the dark isn't evil,
<br>
the night doesn't herald the coming
<br>
of untold horrors and strife.
<br>
<br>
For me darkness is the dusk
<br>
that follows the toils of the day,
<br>
the melancholy felt from knowing
<br>
that each moment must pass and
<br>
all that exists wil come
<br>
to an end.
<br>
<br>
For me it is the darkness
<br>
that mercifully covers us
<br>
and is the refuge of the weary,
<br>
the stillness of heart
<br>
and the quiet of the soul.
<br>
<br>
It is the darkness that tells us
<br>
that as each moment ends
<br>
so does pain and hardship.
<br>
<br>
It's the darkness the tells us
<br>
that nothing is forever
<br>
save the eternal cycle of life and death
<br>
and life again.
<br>
<br>
It's the time and place
<br>
where we can seek refuge
<br>
to heal our wounds
<br>
and face ourselves
<br>
to find new courage and
<br>
calmness of soul.

G'day/night Meg. ~
<br>
<br>
Wow, you really are quite lucky in all of the success you've been having with the entity who you feel that's your guide, "Sereerer". I've done automatic handwriting a bit several years ago and never get any positive results like you have. As Gandalf said, all I ever seem to have been able to get in the past was bser's and time wasters. I got them whether I had protected myself first or not too! Not only that, sometimes, if I done this 'without' protecting myself before doing automatic handwriting and was feeling a particular 'negative' feeling/emotion, not too long afterward, I'd get attacked by who/whatever I had contacted! This must sound a bit bizarre, but it's true! So, like doing anything else spiritual of course, it's best to go into doing even this with some kind of spiritual protection, so you 'don't' attract any kind of 'negative' entity.
<br>
<br>
Well, that's my bit of advice I had to offer. Hope this might further help you a tad bit too. Good luck with your guide, "Sereerer". I hope since you found this out though, "...she was last incarnated on earth in the 1880's in Melbourne," she isn't 'Earthbound' and is unable to progress for this reason...I once got a man who claimed he was 21 and called himself, "Jeff" or "Jeffrey". This man first of all lied to me about his age because I saw him with astral sight and my dog and cat saw him afterward too standing in the room next to me whenever I went downstairs. He was Earthbound alright. I took him into the light a day or two afterward. The day I contacted him and was standing downstairs, I saw my cat's fur stand on end and the dog stared at the air in a very bizarre way and gave out a strange look as she gave out a weird low growl. I also saw Jeff standing there too like they had seen him out of the corner of my eye. One should not 'overlook' the fact that spirits we contact through automatic handwriting as well as by using the Ouija board 'can' be Earthbound and will do and say anything to us to get our attention. ~

Blue Mystic - I hadn't thought of the possibility that she may be an earthbound spirit. I don't feel that's the case, though - did you read my later thread about meeting her in the astral?
<br>
<br>
Jouni, I have asked her about the "we" - she has told me that there is other spirits guiding me, and that they will reveal themselves to me when the time comes. I get the impression that her job is to help me with my AP more than anything else. I was feeling very confused about what this all means to me in terms of changing my physical world, and she told me that she is here to help me with my exit technique and astral experiences, not to find my wisdom for me. She's very blunt like that - she won't help me make any little silly decisions! Thank you for sharing your lovely poem, by the way.

My guide has been teaching me lots of embarressing and humbling lessons about my ego and my impatience, in lots of different ways - Minerva turned out to be one of them.  When I repeated the above prayer and asked specifically for Minerva...What came out of my hand went something like this: I don't want to tell you my story. It is mine, not yours. I've changed my mind, and it isn't my fault." As you can imagine, I was a little disapointed, and a little bit grumpy about it.  Right after, I asked my guide why Minerva wouldn't speak through me, and she basically told me it was her not Minerva, that I shouldn't be so lazy but try to write my own poems and not to attempt these things until I'm at the stage where I can really handle it spiritually.  Then she repeated : "it isn't my fault" (a common justification of mine) I later found out that "Invita Minerva" was an expression used by Roman poets when they had writer's block. Like me. She's a smart cookie, my guide! She must know me really well (duh) because she certainly knows how to teach me a lesson so it gets right under my skin!

I think I really just need to focus on the task at hand, which is to become more proficient at AP, and to use these experiences to find greater connection with the Divine in my daily life.

So there's specialization even in the spirit realm? Makes sense now that I think about it.
<br>
Lol! These guides can be unnervingly accurate and to the point.

I'm still a bit apprehensive about giving AW a go. I guess I don't like the possibility that some guide steps up and proceeds to point out that altthough I may think I've made some spiritual headway I've actually run in circles. Ego-thing, like.
