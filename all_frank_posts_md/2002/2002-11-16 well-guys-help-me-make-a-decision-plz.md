<section>
Aright guys , I have been havin a lot of trouble lately trying to project..I just seem to find my self lieing in bed ...completely relaxed .. feeling my body with a numb feeling .. its wierd.. then when I notice the thoughts coming into my head , I just watch them and try not to drift off to sleep .. then I notice one of those random LOUD sounds and I still remain passive .. nothing else happends really.  Its been like that for a while. After falling asleep everynight for about 3 weeks. . I'm finally able to like..stay awake while watching me dreams almost hehe.. anyway , I think I should take a break .. maybe until Christmas rolls around.
<br>
<br>
I will ask my parents to get me a few books on astral projection.. The first book I'm gonna get is "Astral Dynamics" .. does anyone reccomend a few book that will HELP me project?  I dont want ones filled with experiences that someone had, I'm really interested in ones that will HELP me project.  Can anyone gimmi their suggestions?
<br>
<br>
Also , I'm thinking of maybe just doing energy raising a little bit instead of having the intent to have an OOBE .. should I continue what I'm doing now ? Or just do energy raising  , or just lay off the whole thing until christmas? What do you guys think =P I'm leaving it up to someone else to decide this for me hehe I kinda give up for now lol.  Thanks guys , take care.

I read Astral Dynamics a while ago and it does contain quite a number of techniques and methods. So, from what you say, it should be ideal.

In this case I recomend:  'Projectiology'.

dont stop practicing.  if you take a break it can set you back a lot.  just keep working on the trance state because that i believe is one of the most important factors of having an OBE.  and if you havent already checked out robert petersons book, click here to read it for free

You are well on your way to conscious projection...and no matter what books you read you are going to have to make "the break through" on your own, but I highly recommend Astral Dynamics...also check out the plethora of info on the internet...some of it is better, actually A LOT better, than other stuff, but it's all informative.   Best wishes!
