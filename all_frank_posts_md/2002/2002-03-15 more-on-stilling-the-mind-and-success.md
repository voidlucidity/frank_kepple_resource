Thanks to all who responded regarding my questions earlier about thinking and stilling the mind. Below is something I came upon that Robert Bruce wrote (author of our favorite book), that I found very helpful and mabey some of you others will also:
<br>
<br>
"It is possible to enter the trance state while thinking, but it takes much longer and your thoughts 'change' in quality.  Your thoughts wind down and slow and you start thinking on a different level, with the deeper mind. Your surface mind thinks trivial thoughts that just pop into your head. This is the level you need to shut down. 99% of the OBE experiences of people you read of do not make a full wake induced exit, but have spontaneous or semi spontaneous exits. To make a wake induced exit, the surface mind, all thoughts, must be
<br>
stilled during the exit stage.
<br>
<br>
Think of thoughts, at this time, to be like the clutch of a car.  If the clutch is out, it is 'engaged' and this makes it almost impossible to change gears (impossible to obe exit). But if the clutch is in 'disengaged' then the gears can be changed (the obe exit is achievable). We all do use our deeper mind to think with, during trance and during OBE, but not during the exit stage.
<br>
<br>
Deeper thinking does not generally use words, but feelings and impressions. This is a bit like housework.  If you go into your bedroom to clean it, while you move about picking stuff up and washing and vacuuming, you don't say verbally in your mind 'now I'll wipe that surface', or 'I'd better vacuum the corners', you just 'do' it.  You did think about it, but not in words.
<br>
<br>
In trance, or in OBE (after the exit), you 'can' think, but most of what you think is deeper and more related to the action of doing rather than internal dialog. The trick to keeping an obe more objective is to keep your surface mind clear so you are totally focused on where you are and what you are doing, and not on what you did yesterday or will do tomorrow."

I think this is a vital point to understand for everyone who wants to have an OOBE... if we can't get to this deeper level of thought...the "trance state" (I don't really like that term, don't ask me why though...) then we are not going to have a conscious, fully wake OBE.  It's that simple.  That is why I, along with he majority of others, who have had an OBE, have experienced the phenomena spontaneously.

No, I don't like the term "trance" either because it puts beginners off by confusing them.  I know only too well as it first confused me completely.
<br>
<br>
At the point of projection, you are fully aware of everything that is taking place.  To my mind, you are in anything but a "trance".
<br>
<br>
Trance, to me, means being under some kind of hypnosis.  A state where you are not really aware of what is going on.  Then someone clicks their fingers (or whatever) and you suddenly snap out of it, wondering what happened.
<br>
<br>
The way I would describe it, it's like a veil has been drawn over my sense of outer awareness.
<br>
<br>
What happens is I'm lying on the bed, deeply relaxed, such that my surface thoughts are non-existent.  However, there is still a portion of my conscious awareness that can sense the physical world outside my body.  Even though my mind is still, and all is calm, there is just this fraction of a tiny something that is aware of the physical surroundings.
<br>
<br>
Then, a veil is drawn over this "something".  At that point, there becomes a fixed point of conciousness that is entirely within myself and I am no-longer aware of the "outside world".
<br>
<br>
This fixed point of conciousness absorbs every ounce of my attention.  It seems like everything I am experiencing or thinking stems from or is concentrated upon that fixed point inside myself.  But I am still fully conscious.  At this point, I've stopped rope-climbing or whatever method I'd been using to bring myself to that state.  Then, an instant later the vibrations begin; followed by a feeling like being in an elevator; then off I go.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
