<br>
I met this Astral entity this morning who started entertaining me with his skill in formulating cryptic crosswords. I don't know if I will ever project to him again or not, but on parting he gave me a clue to see if I can solve it:
<br>
<br>
Corporate park exchange notice: moon useful.
<br>
<br>
I'm not a crossword fan and I'm not really sure why I ended up meeting with this chap. But I just wondered if anyone knew the answer. Then I might try going back to this guy and surprise him.

I'm thinking New York City, a company.  But since I don't live in NYC and am not into corporations and such, I can't help you any more . . . try the stock quotes from the Wall Street Journal?
<br>
<br>
Just a gut feeling!

Greetings all,
<br>
<br>
Frank,  I think the entity was trying to stop you from whatever path you were following. He cost me 10 min of my physical path
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.  And I haven't got a clue

Hello Frank, hows it going ? I don't have the answer, but the following link gives info on how to decipher cryptic clues :

<br>
<br>
If you do come up with the correct answer for your guide...maybe you should test his reaction to a cryptic puzzle of your own !

I dunno Frank, I think your newfound Astral friend has found himself with WAY too much time on his hands, HA HA  I checked out the link above and EGAD . . . sounds like a lot of people have way too much time on their hands, to think this stuff up!
<br>
<br>
My boyfriend's brother-in-law is a total brainiac.  He despairs of a good challenge, maybe he can figure it out.  I'll let you know.

At first thought i was wondering if it was some hint of headline news- unfortunately i don't get any papers. Moon- could that be the moonie guy? i thought i read that he owns the washington post? maybe it is the hot stock tip of the decade and we'll never know.

I don't have a clue as to how crosssword puzzles work in english but...

<br>
<br>
First, if the puzzle was given to Frank personally it may be solvable in a British context.  Also it may be a lesson instead of just a riddle for a riddle's sake.
<br>
<br>
Some symbols I think I see:
<br>
usable moon: as a form a crescent which is like a sickle. Waning or waxing? waxing==growth?
<br>
Corporate park: We are corporate so Earth or the physical plane as we know it
<br>
Exchange: a place between or a place of trade. Possibly between physical&amp;astral? an interface?
<br>
Notice: could be a sign or the verb. Pay attention?
<br>
<br>
So: Pay attention or notice in the interface between the physical and the astral the possibility/certainty of growth?
<br>
<br>
2cents and your money back wiitin 3 days if not completely satisfied

i think the entity had noticed that Frank's corporal body was parked and and frank was making good use of his moon(astral) body

Frank, have you ever been to that site before ? Maybe this is the origin of your puzzle.......maybe not.

Thank you for your responses so far. I have to admit the clue really stumps me but, then again, I'm not into doing crosswords. I've never visited the website in the above post, but what I am going to try is get back to the Astral entity that gave me the clue (if I can, that is).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Discovering the intention and nature of this entity would help give rise to, and eliminate, some possibe answers.

I have no idea really, but I was thinking about this entity maybe giving you hints for new companies and corporations in the future? That is, successful companies making profit but at the same time really contributing, sharing, exchanging and being responsible. Companies that have new ways of thinking, producing and so on, with a philosophy that fits into the new era that is gradually coming up? Are you into starting up a new kind of company, or are you having thoughts and ideas about companies of today and how they could be so much better if they changed in different ways? In ways that are much different than today and that seem much better for everyone - the companies themselves, the customers, the non-customers, the environment and the planet?  But to make this possible, our "moon" is useful - or even necessary...and think about the moons symbolic meaning and maybe you've solved the puzzle at least a little bit...unless this all made you even more confused and sounded even more cryptic than the message itself! ;o)

Love and Light,
