i tried Franks method last night, but im still a little confused as to how i become my brow chakra,   what i did was closed my eyes and imagined the blackness to be the back of my forehead inside my head instead of the back of my eyelids, basically imagined my eyes embedded in my forehead,  but i never got any sensations.  Am i doing Franks method right???

Not sure what franks method is
<br>
but the other night when I had a little kundalini experience
<br>
i mentioned i felt like all these energy started to form a halo-ish type thing around my head and i felt like all my mind/body awareness was starting to pool into it
<br>
it was odd
<br>
it did it completely by itself tho
<br>
All i can suggest (if you want to try and repeat what I did)
<br>
is raising as much energy via new as possible
<br>
then focusing on stimulating each energy point open
<br>
then try and bring some energy up your spine until you feel a warm running water type sensation going up and down from your crown to the tailbone...well thats what it felt like for me anyway....
<br>
<br>
anwyay i felt like if i would have gone with the energy halo ball thing, i would have projected into a very high level lucid conscious obe
<br>
but i was scared because there was just to much energy flow for my tastes
<br>

Yes, please excuse me, but I am not sure what "my method" is either. If you could let me know exactly what it is you are attempting to achieve and I'll do my best to help.

I've been doing quite a lot of observational work in this area recently, in addition to my past posts on this topic. What I have found is, your sense of conscious awareness will automatically drift upwards, thus disconnecting from the physical and attaching to the Astral, if it is "allowed" to do so.
<br>
<br>
The first step in the process is to place your physical body in a relaxed position and put aside all your day-to-day worries and concerns, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
Next you need to direct your thought awareness to a point on your forehead that is beween, and about 2cm up, from physical eye-level. What you need to do is imagine you were looking out from that point. At first, all you will see is blackness.
<br>
<br>
When I first started doing this I'd get frustrated at the length of time it took before feeling any kind of familiar exit sensations like vibrations, etc. What I ultimately found was there is a lot of mental tension that accumulates in the brain. Particularly at the front of the head.
<br>
<br>
People can detect tension in the rest of the body fairly easily, given a little practice. But tension in the brain is a little more difficult to detect. The first clues about this were handed to me when I aquired the Monroe Gateway CD's. Wave One has been a brilliant aid to helping me work towards having conscious-exit projections.
<br>

Hi Frank
<br>
<br>
I have wave one - which tip is the aid that helps you? Is it the relaxation guide on the first tape, which allows relaxation to sink more and more deeply into your head?
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>
<br>
Also - Grenade - do yuou always feel energy running down your spine? I always feel it running up.  I've not tried down too much - I wonder if it's a personal preference thing or if the two generate different possibilities for altered conscious states?
<br>

Not sure what is on the tapes, as I have the CDs. But it's the CD that takes you to the Focus10 state. Brilliant stuff. Took me a while to get used to it, but every morning I play the CD once, maybe twice. Then switch the player off and mentally run through the process without the headphones on.
<br>
<br>
I think maybe in about another month or two I won't need the CD at all.
<br>
<br>
It was the bit about letting that sense of relaxation flow into your brain. That was a major turning point, for me, which went on to give me the ability to now have multiple conscious-exit obe's almost every morning.
<br>
<br>
I was already following along basically the same lines as Monroe talks about. For example, as I said in a previous post some time ago, I already had worked out, from around 3-years of trial and error, that it was way more efficient relaxing from the head downwards... rather than the other way around.
<br>
<br>
But it was from listening to the CD, that I began to detect that the brain itself can hold a kind of tension that blocks the ability for your sense of conscious awareness to drift upwards and make contact with the part of your brain that is in tune with the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The sense of "tension" seems to collect during the day and every morning I have to "clear" it. I'm not sure if that will always be the case, or what is the root cause. I have only latched onto this in the past couple of weeks.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I would be lying there for about an hour, hour and a half, after listening to the Focus10 CD, before the onset of conscious pre-exit sensations. But this morning, for example, about 5 minutes after listening to the CD I was roaming the Astral for fun.
<br>

<br>

Go to this website:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.hemi-sync.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.hemi-sync.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
Wait for the page to fully load, then click on, "Tapes &amp; CDs," then click on "Gateway Series."
<br>
<br>
I believe Frank is referring to "Wave 1 - Discovery"
<br>
<br>
Once you take a peek and get some buzzwords, you can search on the internet for the lowest price.
<br>
<br>
Good luck!

I bought the CD's from a company in the UK. I posted their details after I purchased them. It about 6 weeks, or so, ago. I haven't got their details to hand, but if you do a BBS search I'm sure you'll come across it.
