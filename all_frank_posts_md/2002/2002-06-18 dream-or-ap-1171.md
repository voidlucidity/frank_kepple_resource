A while ago, i had a dream, well, which i think started as a dream, then ended in something not like i have ever experienced before.
<br>
Well.  I was in a place, that looked like egypt.  Walking on sand, rocks around us etc.There were thousands of humans, lined up, as far as the eye could see, it was like slavery, but i could feel it wan't actually slavery, it was more like we were lining up to find out our destiny.
<br>
The idea of this mission was to climb a big rock, shapped like an extremely steep pyrimid, a small one too.  There was a lady walking infront of my, i was quite fond of her, she had been told she would make the climb, but i was told i would not make it.  Who told us, i can't rememebr.
<br>
The girl in front of me starting climbing, then i started, as i climbed i could see humans lined up as far as i could see.  I watched the lady climb to the top, swing her leg onto a bar, and climb off the rock, onto the next level.  Sure enough, i tried, and slipped down, just as i had been told i would.  As i slid down the front surface of this rock, i got to certain point, and i fell through the rock, but not my physical body.  It is as though the rock had seperated my spirit from my physical body.  I started to fly upwards, it was very very crowded in here, lots and lots of other spirits all flying upwards, some look back at me and smile, this place felt so happy and complete.  That part of the dream felt so real, nothing like i had ever felt before.  I can't explain the sensation.
<br>
<br>
I just wanted some feedback, what you think it might of been.
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot!

Hi Quant!
<br>
<br>
There are several circumstances by which you can experience an OBE.
<br>
<br>
For example, in some cases I've:
<br>
<br>
- woken up out of my body,
<br>
<br>
- was conscient while going out of my body (relaxing, meditating, feeling vibrations, went out)
<br>
<br>
- was dreaming when I suddenly started an OBE
<br>
<br>
The last scenario seems to have been your case. I've both dreamt about OBEing and actually experienced "real" OBEs in the middle of a dream. Both experiences feel a lot different. If your experience felt so real, it is very likely that your OBE was "authentic" IMO.
<br>
<br>
There's still a difference between OBEs and lucid dreams, though. Did it feel real because you were suddenly in control in your dream or did it feel real because you were experiencing sensations generally associated with OBEs: like floating for example? But your feeling of happiness and completeness seems IMO to indicate your experience was an OBE.
<br>
<br>
Hope it helps!
<br>

Hi!
<br>
<br>
No, i had no control over my dream in this, i know it wasn't a lucid dream.  I think i had one before, maybe you could confirm it for me by reading what i have to say next.
<br>
<br>
This was in no means a real life scenario, well, not that i know of anyways

<br>
<br>
I had 3 dreams, not the same, but with the same situation.  All on different nights.
<br>
<br>
In all of my dreams, i have been wearing a coat.
<br>
I will move onto the third as it is the one i rememeber most.
<br>
<br>
I was running through my old secondary school, chasing a vampire, i think it had killed a member of my family.
<br>
As i ran outside, i watched the vampire run to the middle of the field, and fly straight upwards.  I was trying to so hard to run, but it was as though i was running in slow motion, i just couldn't run, as though someone had a vcr, put a tape in and made it go through slowly frame by frame.
<br>
The same thing had happening in my previous two dreams.  When i was outside and attempted to run, it just didn't happen.
<br>
Back to the third dream, i had to make a conscious decision, it was as though i was the voice of me in my dream, i told my to take off the coat, when i did, i started running at a normal pace, and then fly straight into the sky and killed the vampire.
<br>
<br>
I know it's a funny story, but i think that is an example of lucid dreaming.
<br>
I also have an exprience of maybe RV or OOBE, but i will save that for another post, these all happen when i asleep, which i am working on trying to do when i am awake.
<br>
<br>
What do you think?
<br>
<br>
<br>
After that dream, i never had one of the same situation again.

What you experienced was a lucid-dream release vague Astral-experience, heavily buffered by your own emotive creativity.
