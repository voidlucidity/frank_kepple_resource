Ever since i stopped making psi balls and healing them myself, i was just wondering if theres another way to heal headachs.
<br>
<br>
Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.

There is a system called "craniosacral therapy". It is based on the flow of cerevrospinal fluid. I can tell you that even if it sounds funny, it is the best thing for treating chronic headaches and even migraines and cluster headaches. It combines well with shiatsu and reiki.

Until you know your headache "triggers," you won't be able to "heal" them with anything besides dulling drugs!
<br>
<br>
People who have problems with headaches should keep a journal, where they record their sleep, eating, and behavior patterns.  This tactic works for many kinds of distressing recurring physical symptoms, by the way - - - I've done it for my frequent digestive distresses and found MANY triggers.
<br>
<br>
Then, change your lifestyle/habits to minimize or eliminate the triggers.  Of course, if your headache trigger is your mother-in-law, you've got problems!
<br>
<br>
I carry around a few migrane pills (Butal), just in case one hits at an inopportune moment.  I haven't found its trigger yet, but they happen so rarely that I'm not motivated yet to hunt them down.  MY bugaboo is my intestinal tract.

I've from some people that if you type a belt around the circumference of your head it takes the headache away in about five to ten minutes.

G'day/night there General Army. Just thought I'd say some things in regards to how one can help relieve their headache pains. As much as someone might love eating chocolate, it's not the greatest idea to do, especially when one has a headache. Chocolate could actually make one's headache even worse for some odd reason! ~
<br>
<br>
Yes, as others have mentioned, such as Tom, Reiki can be a great way to help one rid themself of their headache. Headaches mostly could be triggered by a few things: Stress, sinus, muscle tension and so forth. Since headaches could be from a combination of the above I wrote as well, it would be wise to see if you could maybe talk your significant other into massaging your shoulder and the back of your neck. This can really be the place where muscles tense up, especially during a hard and stressful day at work! Also, maybe have he/she massage some caster oil or any other kind of lotion of your choice where your tense muscles might be at that are possibly responsible for causing the headache in the first place. Have he/she massage you for around 7 or more minutes or more depending on how bad your headache is and watch how much better you'll feel afterward.
<br>
<br>
One last thing you may consider is about being massaged is that I was also told to relax during it as much as possible. And, whenever you're finished getting it, you have to lie there afterwards for around 3-5 minutes or until you feel that the headache might've subsided.
<br>
<br>
Also, maybe one could get a warm wash cloth and place it over your eyes and lie with your head back on a pillow or towel or something for 20-30 minutes. Spoil yourself! Nothing's wrong with a nice hot tub every so often, especially if you had a hard day at work and came down with a horrible stress headache! ~
<br>
<br>
Hope this information might help you as well as others who suffer from terrible headaches! Good luck to you! (*smile*) ~

Hi, I don't know if this will help but it is what I do sometimes..
<br>
<br>
I also have chronic headaches at times.  There are certain pressure points in our body that interrupt the nerve/pain process and once interrupted your headache pressure eases if not stops completely..
<br>
<br>
The two spots I use are as follows:
<br>
The fold of skin between your thumb and first finger contains one.  You have to press this area hard  using two fingers [one on either side of the skin fold] and find the nerve there.  Rub your fingers together on that spot. When it hurts a little then you have found the right spot.  Massage this spot on each hand hard for a few moments making sure you are on the nerve.  Do it on both hands.
<br>
<br>
To find the other spot lay your hand flat on a table palm down.  Place three fingers flat on top of your wrist with the third finger being on the wrist joint.  Then use the first finger and bend it down into your arm and press down there and see if you are on a nerve.  It will be approx in that location.  It is around there somewhere in that 'general' vacinity [no pun intended].  It is approx 3-4" above the wrist joint and on top of the arm and it feels like it is in between two ligaments or tendons or something.  It is in the middle.  Just like the thumb spot, when it hurts a little you have found the right spot.  Then massage the nerve on both arms..
<br>
<br>
Both these spots have nerves there that supposedly interrupt the headache process.  Massage them for a few minutes on both hands/arms.  It should help hopefully.  Do it hard enough so that it hurt your hand and arm on the nerve.  Otherwise it will not work.  Or at least it doesn't for me.
<br>
<br>
The two things above works better if it is NOT a miagraine.
<br>
<br>
For migraines, something heavy on top of the head helps.  A bag of marbles is something I have used on top of my head.  Also, you can lay in bed with your head pressed hard and flat against the headboard to apply pressure there...  Good migraine remedies....
<br>
<br>
Good luck, Blossom

Hi All -
<br>
<br>
I don't know what you'd call this exactly but you can make it very easily and its cheap...
<br>
<br>
Buy a bag of rice and maybe some aromatic herbs - mint or spearmint, lavender, herbs like that... and find a soft material like terry cloth or cotton fleece to sew into say 3" x 6" sack - fill the sack with the rice and herbs - you might want to divide the sack into equal compartments to keep the rice from shifting around too much... then whenever you need headache or sore muscle relief heat the rice bag in the microwave for a minute or two - (careful not to make it too hot) - and apply it where-ever it hurts.
<br>
<br>
If you don't sew, you can fill a clean sock with rice (tie a knot in the sock to keep the rice in)...
<br>
<br>
Another thing that I learned is from yoga practice and its good for sinus congestion - you can mix and completely dissolve a quarter teaspoon of salt with about half a cup of water - pour a small amount into your cupped palm, close one nostril and snort the saltwater into the other (ha - sounds silly - but it works).... don't swallow it - immediately after taking it into the nose tilt your head back - and using a towel tilt your head far enough forward again for the liquid to drain out of your nose into the towel - do this for both nostrils - it really relieves the pressure - just make sure not to use too much salt or it will burn.
<br>
<br>
Hope this is helpful

So that's what Rambo was up to then...
<br>
I'm not suprised that he suffered from severe headaches as he was exposed to many high stress situations!

Another chinese pressure point thingy that might work: rub your temples in circular motion, and use some force so that you can really feel it. I don't know if this works, cause I don't get headaches ( I know I'm blessed).
<br>
<br>
Hope this works
