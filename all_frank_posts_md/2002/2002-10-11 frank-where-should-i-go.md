Sorry, but there are no easy answers to your questions. You need to research as much material as you can and try to find methods and ways that suit you.
<br>
<br>
Me, I'm a great fan of the Monroe school and the Phasing approach. Lots of other people follow methods published by Rober Bruce who talks of all kinds of Energy Raising concepts, etc. Basically, you need to study the various approaches and work on finding your own way.
<br>
<br>
To me, the "fun stuff" is in the finding out, or the discovery aspect, whether I'm phased into Physical or Astral. Problem is, though, everyone's idea of Fun is different.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I have the same dang problem all the time- out of body and nowhere to go.
<br>
I just started thinking of some interesting place- in real time or on the astral plane, then focused on it. I got there immediatly, sure enough. Maybe even think of someone you want to visit.
<br>
You might want to go find your guides.
<br>
<br>
FUNNY STORY: I don't know how well aquainted you are with Wicca, but while OBE I decided I wanted to go see the "temple of the goddess" (a place a priestess once told me of) and guess where I wound up? My own vagina! LOL! I guess every woman has her very own "temple of the goddess."
