<section>
Firstly, thanks to all of you who posted a response to my earlier plea for help.
<br>
<br>
The technique I am using is as follows:
<br>
<br>
Relaxation - roughly 5-10 minutes of deep regular breathing while relaxing each part of my body - I feel very relaxed by the end of this.
<br>
<br>
Pre-projection (never get to post unfortunately) After relaxing, I have started closing my eyes and staring upwards.  This causes a vibrating sensation that starts in my head, and in particular, seems to make me lose any feeling in my legs, my arms feel....Tingley!  The vibrations are not all over my body (not in chest, back or groin area.
<br>
<br>
From this point, should I use an exit technique, or concentrate on the brow chakra?
<br>
<br>
ALSO - - -
<br>
I notice frank mentioned he has a beer or so.  I sometimes like to have a beer or smoke a joint (Once a week or so) This seems to get me to the vibrating point much quicker, and obviously helps me to relax. Is this a harmful pracise for projection or is it something that can aid me?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>

 Permit me to correct you here: I did say that I do like to have a couple of beers or some wine in the evenings. But in the same breath I also said that it scuppers my chances of projection.
