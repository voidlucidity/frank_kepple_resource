Just thought of a really interesting question, apologies if its been raised before in times pl (pre lysear)
<br>
<br>
Whats the first thing you will do when you have a concious projection? or if you've done it whats the first thing you did?

The first thing I would do personally is to get some proof for myself! i will go into my flatmates room and mention something in there which i wouldnt know was there and then ask them in the morning!
<br>
Also I wouldnt mind a short trip to the akashik records!

I used to tell myself, "When I get out, the first thing I'll do is prove to myself and everyone else that these are real!"
<br>
<br>
But then when I found myself projecting for the first time, my outlook changed!  I knew right then and there that I didn't have to seek proof anymore, because I KNEW that they were real.  It's like me trying to convince you that you're awake right now.  It would be somewhat pointless to do!
<br>
<br>
Then people say, "Well Jeff...don't you want to convince others so THEY know that they're real?"
<br>
<br>
My answer is, "Are you crazy!?  There is still so much for me to learn and accomplish personally when I am projecting....I'm too busy getting my own questions answered to convince others that my experiences are real.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,

Depends, if I felt I could maintain recollection I'd seek out my guide to get a few answers for the next time.
<br>
If not I'd make damn sure that I'd be able to recall as much as possible and head back pretty quickly.
<br>
In both cases my next move would be to proceed to do a jig and post details here.
<br>
As a matter of fact I think I may have had two or three projections recently but I can't decide whther they were projections or lucid dreams - if there is a difference.

<section>
you sound like me jilola. i had an experience but i'm not sure if it was lucid or projection but whats the difference? the first thing i tried in this instance was to do a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram (for those who dont study magick it is a protection ritual that is supposed to banish the imediate area around you) for those who dont do magick do it! its all based around changing the astral to effect the physical, buy 11 lessons in the higher magickal arts if you are interested!

The reason I suspect they weren't LDs is that I didn't think "Hey, I'm dreaming" but yet I knew it wasn't my daytime reality. Also each of them had a theme that carried over from one to the other only presented with different imagery.
<br>
BTDT, the banishing I use occasionally to signify a time where I need to be really focused, so it's more introverted for me.
<br>
<br>
What happened when you did the ritual?  You kin of drifted off the subject there

I'm another one who just wanted to get out and back in.  It's said that if you do it, you'll know it, that there are no doubts about it. Well, I had a "partial" that was vivid and obvious, but the full exit one was bizarre, and it ended up that the first thing I did was invoke light from The One in order to get a horde of astral monkeys to stop storming through the window above my dresser.  Naturally, this little traumatic event snapped me right back to my body.  Without going into details, (because I have to go to work, pronto), there were aspects of this experience that caused me to wonder, also, if it were just a lucid dream.  I know it had my heart beating really fast, that's for sure!

HI,
<br>
I looked back through my files and I think this is the first experience using the phasing method to OBE. Please note that before this I had been able to send my conciousness out to any destination,as in remote viewing, for years before this. This is dated March 27th, 2000.
<br>
<br>
" I was meditating the other evening,using the third eye, I began to look inward. After a few moments a child appeared a little to my left, but very near to me.
<br>
A beautiful child, dark skin,large eyes, with his chin resting on his forearm.He seemed to be simply gazing expectantly at me.I stood there looking at him not knowing what to do, then finally I lifted him close to me and just held him.
<br>
Later that evening when the house was quiet, I decided to go back there to
<br>
see him. I entered a room where a man in a white robe was sitting at a
<br>
wooden table. He had an abacus and a paper tablet. He was working the abacus by lamplight,and writing in the tablet.He did not seem to take notice of me.
<br>
Finally I asked "To what are you adding, or  what are you subtracting from?"
<br>
He did not look away from his calculations but answered "I am balancing your
<br>
karma."
<br>
Wow!This is so exciting for me!"

jilola I had a bit of  a problem when I tried to do the lesser banishing of the pentagram, i started to try and form the pentagrams and my arm wouldnt lift up high it went to my hips but no higher, that was weird. The difference between me and you is that I knew what i was doing, knew I ws dreaming and I woke up out of my body the other way round then walked around a bit before going back in

 Lysear:

The couple of times that I suspect were actually OBEs I didnät think to do anything much less a ritual of any kind. I'll be sure to try what happens when I get the chance.
<br>
As for hands not rising high enough that may be a question of practise, like getting to know the dimension of the projected double.

<section>
The first time I got out I was just look at everything. I was in a field surrounded by a forest. The thing is I was not trying to project at all, I did not even know what it was at the time. So I was standing in this field admiring the scene then thought about where I was just a second ago and poof I was back in my body. So my first experience was kind of different in that I did not know what was going on, but I did enjoy it.
<br>
<br>
As for people seeking proof of AP being real. What exactly would you like for proof? Such statements sound misled to me, though totally understandable, because they are wanting physical proof. This to me sounds like the person is under the assumption that the phsycial is the only reality. The reality is that there are other planes, if that is what we shall call them. They do not have to reflect the physical exactly or at all. If you want to interact with the physical then what is the point in projecting as you are already in your body for interacting with the physical plane. I am like Jeff, when I project that is proof enough for me as it is very real, more real than the physical most of the time. I want no proof for anyone else because I realize that there is no proof that I can give them to make them believe or understand. And I really do not wish for anyone to just take my word for it. The only proof I wish to give anyone else is the experience for themself, which is really beyond words.

when i have my first controlled projection i will probably do nothing.  wherever i end up or however i end up is exactly how i'm going to stay and i'm going to take in as much as i can w/out moving, and see how long i can make it last.

The first thing you need to do is remain still, very still. Because the moment you let your mind run away, that's it, you've lost it. More than likely you'll shoot back to physical, continue sleep, and will have forgotton the experience come wake-up time.
<br>
<br>
The best thing in the world is to project, realise it, come straight back, wake up immediately on re-entry, get out of bed and make notes. Reflect for 30 minutes, or so, on the experience... then you can do whatever. Next day you'll have a smile from ear to ear.

i have two ears but some people only have one.  what will happen w/ their smile?  will it fall off of their face or will it wrap all the way around their head?  this is a very important subject that needs to be cleared up before those people try and project.  it would be sad to see someone project and then to have their smile fall off of their face.  just wondering.

<section>
funny you should mention me being high all of the time.  i don't use any drugs or drink, but i really feel that i am high all of the time.  this is corny but i feel i m high on life. constantly.  i m always a ten.  i won't say that it's impossible to get me down because the only thing i've learned is that i'll never know anything, but you get the idea.
<br>
<br>
have you ever been happy about being happy?  or have you ever appreciated that you are the only species on this planet that can appreciate?
<br>
i think about these things constantly and it just spirals.
<br>
<br>
has anyone ever fallen in love w/ theirself? i have about a year agoand it was exhilrating.  i've realized  that i'm my favorite person and i can make myself feel better than anyone else ever could.  being alone isnt anymore. now all of this seems very gay and  corny i know, but i m still so very confident in myself enough to tell you all about this sentence that came to mind yesterday.  if you continously say it so that it loops and there is no period , you get two different sentences out of it sorta.
<br>
<br>
myself loves that i can love
<br>
<br>
if love heals and you actually believe this sentence when you think or say it i can't imagine the effect it would have on you.  i'm sure this would carry over enormously when sending healing w/ reiki or prayer.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
What I would like to do and what I will do are probably 2 different things:
<br>
<br>
What I will do is get back in pretty quickly and make some notes as I want to remember it without thinking back and saying did it really happen.
<br>
<br>
What I would like to do is go to somewhere like New Zealand. after wathcing lord of the rings I would love to fly like a bird, over and around such a beautiful place.  I would also like to raise my vibrations and try and contact my father who died a few months ago. I have things I want to say to him.
<br>
<br>
I would also like to fly out of the earths atmosphere and look down on the planet.  That would be truly awesome.
<br>
<br>
So many things to do, gotta get out though!!!!
<br>
<br>

I can sort of see where you coming from fredhedd, I used to be the same, then I failed college and suffered from severe depression and still do. I stated getting drunk every night and I smoked cannabis like it was going out of fashion. The social anxiety set in then I became extremely paranoid about everyone and everything. Then I started thinking I was seriously ill all the time, every ache and pain became a serious illness and I kept thinking I was gonna die. Stupid yes, but I thought I was never gonna get better, I thought I was going mad. Then I was stupid enough to do cocaine for a week, but I gave that up straight away before I damaged myself.
<br>
<br>
I'm pretty much sorted now, I still drink a bit and cannabis is almost out of my life completely, still find it hard to resist every now and then. But it's coz of this I want to learn about AP and similar things. If I can have an OBE, why would I need the drugs or booze? Thats the intention I use to project, to sort my life out. Anyway, i've gone off on one here, but I thought writing it down and showing people would strengthen my intention to project. With any luck mate, i'll be just like you and learn to be happy with myself.

<section>
this is starting to get completely off topic but i really dont see what the problem is w/ that.  we're still just sharing our info and ideas.  i definetely can not relate to your situation.  however, i've been down so to speak but it didn't affect my personality or my outlook on things.  there have been many  times in my life where things went the dirty way.  somehow i managed to not falter the slightest.  drugs were just never my thing.  i waited till i was bout twenty one to try anything.  this was kinda wierd because all of my friends and family were doing stuff.  i tried it then to experiement.  to see what it was like.  not to be cool like the younger crowd usually does.  truth is i can't handle any drugs or alcohol.  i'm a big puss when it comes to anything that will poison my body.  the few times i smoked weed i had this enormous pressure where my brow chakra is.  little did i know it was activating it tremendously and i felt extremely uncomfortable.  since i've started new i've tried it once more to see if it would help w/ my meditation but it just serves to hinder.  like i said i'm not positive but i don't see anything getting me down, at all.
<br>
<br>
if i do get out before you i'll send for you though.  this brings up maybe another topic.  would it be possible to kind of send for others instead of trying to help them physically/astrally project.  kind of like the instantaneous travel method. i dunno i'll have to think more on it.

Some people can handle things better than others, I couldn't handle my failure. I was a mess, everyone around me moved on, my parents wanted money for house keeping, I couldn't provide coz I didn't have a job. So I got stoned, forgot about it. When that stopped working, i did a few lines of coke and got wasted on whiskey and beer. Now i'm coming off it, sleep is a rare thing, which is why my posts are timed and 4 i the morning usually. (it's ten past three now).
<br>
<br>
Depression is a nasty thing, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I lost two stone in weight in a month. Well, like I said, AP is my cure, and i'll learn it if I die trying.
<br>
<br>
As for sending for people, this would be hard. Don't know nothing about the idea, but surely the person your sending for would have to be projecting also, otherwise they wouldn't here you.

To Marty D.
<br>
<br>
I found myself in a similiar situation when younger. It was the worst drawn out experience. No money. Living with relatives. Drinking problem.
<br>
<br>
The way I got out of it was perseverance and patience to name a few.
<br>
<br>
1. Quit drinking and smoking.
<br>
<br>
2. Thought of some type of job I wouldn't mind doing that would pay what I could live well off of.
<br>
<br>
3. Enrolled in an Insititute to get the training necessary to be ellible. Find one that has a high success rate after completion.
<br>
<br>
4. Waited a year to get in the school.
<br>
<br>
5. Worked hard to get good grades ( I never did in high school).
<br>
<br>
6. Graduated, and began sending out resumes.
<br>
<br>
7. Eventually I landed a job in another state. Where I lived employment sucked.
<br>
<br>
But you have to realize it is a step by step process that doesn't happen over night.
<br>
<br>
<br>
WEIRDZLY!

The first time that I had an OBE I was only out for a short period of time, then I got jolted back in. The second time, when I had a lot more time to deal with, I flew around my room, and then went into the crawlspace, which I've always wanted to see. I noticed that there were lots of large white sheets of plastic/tarp like things strewn across the place. I still have yet to go up there and see it in my physical form, as "testing my astral vision" would not be good enough reason to explain to my parents my reason for going up there.

Several years before I started OBE training, I had a couple of experiences which I am now convinced were out of body. One was in the astral plane (1995), and the other was in the real-time zone (1994). In the RT experience, I was flying around the living room, and then I went into my brother's room, only to realise what was happening, at which point the experience ended. I chalked it off as a dream the next morning, as I knew next to nothing about OBEs, and really didn't believe in them at the time. However, after having several OBEs, including ones similar to the experience in '94, I've come to realise it was the real deal.

I'll tell you guys about the astral experience in a future post.

I've done it! I had my first OBE about an hour ago and i'm still in shock! All i did was fly round my room a couple of times, but I still did it! But my wisdom tooth has decided to shoot through and it keeps cutting in to my cheek, so it's not all good, keeps putting me off.

Well, the

 plan
</i>
is to get out, mold the shape of my etheric double into what I want it to look like,  then sneak into my friends house and look around. But, hey,  people never stick to their plans.
