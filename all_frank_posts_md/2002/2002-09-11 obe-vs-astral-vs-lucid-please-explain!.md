Lucid dream..you are aware you are dreaming while dreaming.....and can do stuff..
<br>
OBE - totally conscious in the "real world" ie you can see your physical body sometimes lying on the bed etc...usually means you are working in the real world or a copy of same and cannot usually manipulate the 2astral" environment like in a Lucid dream which is still of the nature of a "dream" environment...

sorry on rereading my last post it is not very clear..
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
..but nothing in this ever is..until you are 100% conscious in an OBE..best thing as usual is to try to expereince the three different things..youll soon "know" the difference..words fail sometimes...

The most basic difference is your level of conscious awareness.
