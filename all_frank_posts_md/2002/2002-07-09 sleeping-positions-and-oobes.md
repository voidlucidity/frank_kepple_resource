Fellow Travelers,
<br>
<br>
Do sleeping positions effect OBEs?  When ever I roll over on to my back while I am a sleep, I have night mares. If I try to fall asleep while on my back, my brain will not turn it'self off to let me sleep.  I always sleep on my stomach or on my side.  Because I have problems sleeping on my back, I wonder if this makes it difficult to project while in trance or just to project in general?  Any ideas?

For me it makes no difference.
<br>
<br>
Though at first I found if a habitual sleeping-postion was adopted there was a strong urge to fall asleep rather than practice obe'ing. But now it makes absolutely no difference how my physical body is lying, provided it is reasonably comfortable.

Frank,
<br>
Even though you are laying down in a comfortable position, after a period of time do you get that antsy feeling to change positions?

<br>
Yes, sometimes.
<br>
<br>
When I first started seriously practising conscious-exit obe I'd have to lay on my back as, if I lay on my side (habitual sleeping position) I'd simply fall asleep. However, after a while of laying on my back, I'd feel a strong urge to turn on my side. The longer I'd remain on my back, the greater the urge to roll on my side would become: which would eventually scupper any projection attempt.
<br>
<br>
So this was more than a little frustrating, at first. However, after a while, my mind got used to the idea of laying on my back hence the urge to roll over became less and less. As I say, now it hardly matters.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks, Frank, for you comments.
<br>
<br>
I am exactly in this stage now: I can't lay for more then 10 - 15 min. on  the back. It becomes terribly uncomfortable. Then usually I turn to my side and fall asleep. I thought it's only my problem. Now I can see the light in the tunnel, e.a. I know it's possible to overcome it, as you did.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
DG.

Dear Frank,
<br>
Thanks for the advice.  It have given me something to look forward to.  How long did it take you to overcome the antsyness of laying on your back?
<br>
<br>
You have given me new hope.

It took me about 2 months before I could lay comfortably on my back for an extended period (1 to 2 hours).
<br>

Oh!  I remember that urge to roll over on my side.  Isn't that cumbersome?  Very frustrating at times.  I couldn't help but to roll over ... but ... one thing that helped is placing a part of my body at a strange angle.  I'd dangle my foot or my arm over the side of the bed (while laying in my side).  I still got to roll over, but putting another part of my body out of place kept me awake enough to stay in tune with my determination.

HAHAHA Quite interesting. I could NEVER sleep on my back for the LONGEST time. Want to know the easiest way to learn to sleep on your back? Go jump out in front of a car!(Just a joke,don't actually do it) because you will wind up in the hospital. Hospital beds have a nasty effect to where you can ONLY sleep on your back, regardless of how you alter the backpeice. i had my appendix removed after some terrible side pains and when i awoke in my hospital bed, i couldn't sleep for 2 days. Not joking. I went for a full 48 hours without sleep. i finally fell asleep in that cursid bed and now I can fall asleep on my back with no urge to roll over at all. I still take about 30+ minutes to fall asleep though.. Thats why attempting OBE is best on my back.
