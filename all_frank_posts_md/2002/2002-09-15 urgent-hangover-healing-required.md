<br>
I went out last night. Not a great drinker, nor am I used to late nights. Bit of a bad combination when you're at a party. Needless to say I didn't obe this morning.

So a bit of "healing help" swung my way would be appreciated, thanks.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I have a great hangover cure - don't drink any alcohol, or consume any other toxic/addictive/mind altering substances

Ginseng and excedrin are supposed to help. I happen to enjoy drinking sometimes even though it is against my religion (Mahayana Buddhism). Worse, my tolerance is fairly low. When overdoing I tend to get sick and stay that way. The pills help. If you know you are going to drink, start hydrating quickly and stay that way. Maybe starting out with some excedrin and food would help. When you are already sick it is not easy to think about food and water.

Bit late now, but drink tons of water when u wake up to rehydrate. Then go eat a couple big fat burgers - a big mac is ideal - nothing gives your energy back better. If u plan on making it a habit, hit the gym more often and work on cardio - you can take a lot more hard nights and bounce back better. And swear to yourself that you'll never do it again

<section>
yeah Adrian.. I agree totally...!!!
<br>
<br>
A hangover is the result of too much alcohol in your body for you to process and besides all that....it damages your liver which is one of the MOST important organs on our body:
<br>
<br>
READ and LEARN:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 After you ingest alcohol, your body breaks it down into (among other things) acetaldehyde, before converting it into less harmful substances.  The acetaldehyde messes with your brain at the same time as a host of depleted minerals are short- circuiting your nervous system, and that's in addition to low blood sugar and the classic headache-and-dry-mouth symptoms caused by dehydration. The result: nausea, twitchy nerves, unpleasantness, pessimism, terrible brain pain, and a temporary suspension of the laws of gravity.
 <br>
 <br>
 The severity of a hangover varies according to . . .
 <br>
 <br>
 1.  The amount you've guzzled in a given period of time
 <br>
 2.  Your own innate enzymatic capacity to deal with the poisons
 <br>
 3.  Your age
 <br>
 <br>
 Translation: the more you drink in a short amount of time, the more you'll feel the alcohol. One's weight is also a factor (the less you weigh, the more you'll feel it), as is a genetic predisposition. Finally, the older you get, the more you'll feel the alcohol the next morning.
</b>
<br>
<br>
=================
<br>
Adrian has the best solution... and no I don't drink either..
<br>
<br>
Blossom...

<section>
G'day Folks!
<br>
<br>
I am absolutely shocked to hear that non-Australian people consume alcohol!
<br>
<br>
But please dont' get the wrong idea: I don't drink very much, I just kinda spill most of it..... hic...!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oldfashioned Aussie Boozing Advice:
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Stick to one kind of drink and don't mix. Its ok to have a glass of champers for a toast, but then go back to your standard poison. And never switch to spirits just because you are full and can't drink anymore.  Your stomach is trying to tell you something, so just admit you are full!
<br>
<br>
2. Find something that does not cause a bad reaction in your system. Everyone is different so its a matter of experimentation.  Every brand of beer or wine or spirit is different, and each will cause a different reaction.
<br>
<br>
3. The 'quality' of what you drink is important.  Cheap whisky or etc will give you a massive hangover, whereas an expensive malt will give you only a mild headache.  This particularly applies to the quality of wine.   Cheap cask wine will do it to you every time:)
<br>
<br>
4. Drink a large glass of 'water' between each drink of alcohol (water, not soda).  If you are in a picnic or BBQ situation and want to appear sociable, eg, that you are not a total wowser, fill a beer can or bottle with water and carry it with you between alcoholic drinks.  Or, get a wine glass and pretend the water is wine, etc. If you are drinking red wine, add a dash of rasberry or etc.
<br>
<br>
5. Snack and eat while you drink.  Wine is about 1/3 the strength of spirits. Remember this next time you swig down that large glass of red.  Also, champagne will get you drunk faster than anything, re its highly carbonated and the carbonation forces it into your blood stream very quickly.
<br>
<br>
6. Before bed, drink as much water as you physically can hold.
<br>
<br>
7. Keep a bucket by your bed, just in case you can't reach the big white telephone and call your old mate Hui for a chat, eg "Huuuuuuuiiiiiiiiieee"
<img alt="::)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
<br>
<br>
8. If you wake up at 3 or 4 am with a bad headache, take a full dose of asprin (asprin works best) and more water, then go back to bed.  You might still wake up feeling sick, but at least your head will not be throbbing so much.
<br>
<br>
9. Over the shelf anti inflammatory medication helps a lot if you get a hangover headache. Ice packs are also good to reduce brain swelling.
<br>
<br>
10. You will find that if you eat a large meal before a night of drinking, you will not be able to drink as much and what you do drink will not affect you as much.  Drinking on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster.
<br>
<br>
11. Pace yourself and drink at your own pace. Don't empty your glass just because someone else is ahead of you, no matter what they say.  If they insist on giving you another drink, take it and just let it sit on the table, or toss the other half drink away instead of tossing it down your gullet.
<br>
<br>
11. Some emergency advice:  If you find you are totally smashed after a party and 'know' you'll be really sick the next day, but you have to work or function in some way, an old sailor's trick will save the day.  Drink as much water as you possibly can, and then take a swig of ipicak (sp?) syrup, eg, that stuff you keep in your medicine cabinet to give people if they take poison.  Make sure you are in the bathroom when you do this. After you have emptied yourself, take plenty of activated charcoal and water, some asprin and vitamins, and then sleep it off. You'll wake up fresh and healthy, or at least reasonably functional and pain free.
<br>
<br>
12. A less severe way than the above to minimize the damage is to just take activated charcoal with lots of water before bed, with a couple of asprin.  This absorbs the poisons of alcohol and helps stop the coming brain inflammation, etc.
<br>
<br>
13.  Finally, if you blow it and end up with a massive hangover, I recommend Vegemite tea, eg, melt a couple of heaped teaspoons of Vegemite in a cup of boiling water, add a dash of pepper and salt and drink.  Take one of these with a couple of slices of toast.  If you can hold this down, drink a few glasses of water with vitamins, asprin and anti inflammarories. Then go back to bed for two hours (don't forget the bucket). You'll wake up reasonably functional.
<br>
<br>
14. Finally2, anyone who physically passes out through alcohol should be taken to hospital for treatment and or observation. Any loss of consciousness is serious!  I had a very good friend (Mick) killed by friends who did not follow this advice. His friends dumped him on his parent's front lawn and just left him there.  He rolled onto his back and drowned in his own vomit.  At the very least, put comatose friends into the coma position, so they cannot possibly roll onto their backs and drown (that's why they call it the 'coma' position).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!!!!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

<section>
from personal experience, the best way to avoid a hangover is to pass out drunk at a party, going to the hospital for observation (thank god they didn't have to pump
<img alt=":-P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
), freaking out all of your friends and being the object of ridicule and embarrassement for many years to come! You'll never have a hangover again - because you'll stop drinking for good!
<br>
<br>
cheers

don't drink (and do anything)

The water and asprin regimen is a good suggestion but I would say to remember what R.V. Winkle said,  "I slept for how long?"   Sleep it off and don't get up until you can stand straight.

I find drinking fruit juice before going to bed better than water but NOT pleasant if you end up throwing it up.....yukky acidic. But it has lots of useful nutrients and stuff in it, maybe mix with water. Or milk, down a few pint of that before sleep, always works wonders. Paracetamol (sp?) is my personal favourite over aspirin, but each to their own.

water is the way to go.  if you usually throw up the next morning, eat a banana the night before.  i found  out accidentally that bananas taste better coming out than they do going in. i know it sounds gross but when i was vomiting it tasted  like a banana slushy was coming out and not anything bad at all. it actualy tasted very good.

Heh!
<br>
<br>
The best idea to never have an hang over is to remain always drunk!
<br>
<br>
My friend, drinking is really bad for your health, though sometimes alchool helps in dilating blood vessels and avoid strokes.
<br>
Nevertheless, a healthy life and some daily exercise wil do the same with other much more wanted side effects.
<br>
Personal,y I do not drink, only in some ocasions, where I can take a glass of chanpagne, or good Port wine, but drinking for me is not a tabu.
<br>
Using without abusing is the rule I advice for people who like the taste of a good beverage.
<br>
To heal a hangover there are certain accupressure points that heal it immediatly, but, before I post them here, I wan't to reflect a bit to know if this won't encourage people from this forum to drink more!
<br>
My best to you all.

Thanks for all the advice. Call me boring but I've decided to follow Adrian's advice and give up alchohol entirely. Never drank much in any case, but it was nice sharing a bottle of wine with my wife in the evenings (though it would scupper any chance of projection).
<br>
<br>
So that's it, I'm completely drug free (and feeling kind of sterile).

Look Frank, (and anyone ese interested)
<br>
there's no need to go to extreme monkinsh measures here of abstaining from any form of alchohol etc.
<br>
<br>
It's simply a case of 'everything in moderation', simple.
<br>
There's nothing wrong with enjoying a 'wee dram' as we say here in Scotland, just don't go overboard.
<br>
Incidentally, concerning drinks effect of AP, My most recent projection was when I was lying on the bed after drinking a wee bit to much, (so there!)
<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with the 'earthly pleasures' but just like everything else, its just a question of balance!

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Congratulations on that move from alcohol
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; I realise that you were not much of a drinker of course, neither was I, like you, it was mostly the red wine with a meal etc., but it does make a big difference.
<br>
<br>
I have also quit coffee as well completely (I never drank tea) - I drink grapefruit juice mostly, and some tomato juice with plenty Worcester and Tabasco
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
And I also drink water of course.  I used to enjoy good Arabica coffee thoughout the day, but again, it is a sacrifice worth making. I am also vegetarian - no meat or fish.
<br>
<br>
Tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and all other drugs and mind altering substances, do remain in your system for days, lowering vibrations and Astral control, and upsetting the elemental balance in your body - a cause of illness.
<br>
<br>
Gandalf: I agree with balance in all things, but balancing these drugs and poisons I find somewhat counter intuitive
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; Balancing encompasses such things as food, excercise, sleep and other Spirit, Soul and Body attributes.
<br>
<br>
I really believe that humanity will go in this direction over time.

Again, well done Frank!

<br>
I've been off alchohol for over a week and, I have to admit that in spite of the fact I didn't drink all that much, it *has* made a difference.
<br>
<br>
I'm now starting to project before sleep (as well as after) which I'm sure will help my progress, and my day to day thinking is a tad clearer than normal too. Though I do feel a bit sterile as alchohol was my only vice: don't drink tea or coffee, take any other drugs, nor do I eat any processed food or sugar, and riding horses gives me plenty of excercise.

It's a bit weird because I had been having dreams about myself in circumstances where I'd be at a bar, or some like place, declining to have a drink when offered. I never thought much about it at the time, but it takes on a whole new significance now.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Congratulations again - your diet sounds most sensible indeed to me!
<br>
<br>
Just don't let Harath go taking you to any Astral bars

<br>
But your post raises some excellent points. People do not realise that it can take some weeks for the toxins from alcohol and caffeine (and that includes coke as well as tea and coffee) to be freed from the system. It certainly doesn't happen overnight - it is a steady process depending on how much was being consumed on an ongoing basis and over how many years.
<br>
<br>
Also with such things as processed/refined white sugar - not good!
<br>
<br>
Although I am a vegetarian as a matter of principle  - I cannot participate by default in the harm of
<b>
 any
</b>
creature of
<b>
 any
</b>
variety or size, and for whatever purpose -  red flesh meat will also drag down vibrations as well.
<br>
<br>
But common sense is also correct. I would never advocate Asceticism, but too many people eat all the wrong things because it is the way they were raised, and/or it is too tempting to get them from supermarket shelves.
<br>
<br>
Anyone looking to progressing Astrally and Spiritually should take a good hard look and meditate on their own diet in my humble opinion.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

First off, great thread!
<br>
But a few questions...
<br>
<br>
What is the deal with Monroe having to abstain from alcohol and other mind numbing drugs?
<br>
Bananas taste better coming up than going down? I might have to try that I'm so curious.
<br>
What's the 'coma position'?
<br>
<br>
I find that if I've drank too much it's best to just purge myself of the alcohol... I'm going to vomit sometime, it might as well be now!

Back in highschool everyone used to say that you should eat vegemite if you have a hangover.  I myself live off the stuff, but the irony is that Vegemite is actually made from a biproduct of making beer. Thus without beer there is no vegemite, but with no beers then there are no hangovers and so no need for Vegemite. [V] But perhaps I might not be thinking straight due to certain factors and in need of some Vegemite? [

PS I know some of you aren't good at English so I decided to write slowly.

Thanks, but I've tasted vegemite.  [xx(]
<br>
<br>
In fact, given that alternative I think giving up drink entirely doesn't sound so bad!  [^]

ugh. I drink TOO much caffeine, and yeppers, i had alcoholics in my family history (not my parents though). SO, looks like i need to do some serious backing off of tea and coffee and other substances. Which is weird cause i used to never touch the stuff, then i started a little, then a little more, then coffee in the mornin, then tea in the day, then coffee in the evening, then wine after the coffee, and blah blah blah.
<br>
<br>
It has REALLY affected my spiritual and physical side, and the only saving grace i had is that i drink copious amounts of water and exercise everday. Still, this is a great thread, thanks for the support and wise words.
<br>
<br>
By the way, avoid fake sugar too! That crap sent me into an abysmal spiral of despression from mixing way too much with coffee and tea.
