Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.

I have read that it is very possible, though it is a little different than saying "Meet me at the park". It also requires a lot of skill and know how, which I do not have yet. If you have a lot of control on the astral then I am sure someone on here or on the net somewhere can tell you how. If you do not then you need to practice that before worrying about setting up meetings. There might be a topic on this on here somewhere, as I remember reading about this though I am not sure if it was on these boards. You should try doing a search.

Yes you can. But the "time" aspect doesn't come into it as, on the Astral, there is no time. So, basically, anything can happen whenever.

Why yes it is. One time I intended to astral project and see if I could scare my mom, thinking I would appear as a ghost. I didnt relize that she would be asleap by the time I "got out" . She was in the other room, and when I found her there I "awoke" her from her body. we both flew away from the house laughing (it is extreamly joyful to just be out of body. ) anyway, the next day she confirmed it. its wieard, she astral projected once when she was little (19 or so) and told me about it a few years ago.I became interested and learned it. I have become pretty good at it now, and when I got her out, that was only her second astral experence.

<br>
but yes, it can and dose happen. you just have to have that intent when you get ready to project. Â my mom didnt even know I was gonna go astral that night.

That is an interesting idea, metaphysic. How do you "wake someone up" while sleeping to the astral? Do you do it like you would normally, except since you are out of body you are interacting with their astral body? I have not done anything to find or interact with people while out of body.
