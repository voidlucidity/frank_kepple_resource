<section>
Yesterday evening, I experiemented with PHASING into the Astral, with some success.  Here's my details of the process used and pending results.
<br>
<br>
As I originally posted about, when I first joined, my original 2 OBE's (spontaneous ... unexpected) occured by relaxing to the point, that my physical body went to sleep, while my mental awareness/consciousness never did.  I ended up entering into 2 Wake-Induced Lucid Dreams and then finally experienced 2 out-of-body projections.  This sets the stage for *my process* of Phasing, as I have always thought, that if I can *re-create* some of the original physical and mental parameters, then I could successfully duplicate the experience and it's awareness/clarity levels of mind/thought ... which I haven't been able to achieve from the sleeping state of OBE projection.
<br>
<br>
Here's what I did:
<br>
1)  Made sure I was mentally refreshed ... so I took a Brain Food supplement (Ascend 'N See) to ensure this.
<br>
<br>
2)  Turned on the lights in the Living Room so that I could SEE the RED GLOW
<br>
from behind my eyelids.  This helps create a 3D space to stare into ...
<br>
gives you SOMETHING to FOCUS ON *Externally*.
<br>
<br>
3)  Made sure that I was physically relaxed
<br>
a)  Took GOTU KOLA 1/2 hour prior to experience
<br>
b)  Sat down on our cushy couch so that head and body were
<br>
fully supported
<br>
<br>
4)  Verbally stated INTENT of going OBE by transferring my Consciousness from my Physical Body to my Astral Body, just as I had done A Christmas last year.
<br>
<br>
5)  Relaxed while focusing on the red glow of eyelids.
<br>
<br>
6)  Relaxed my breathing to a normal breathing pattern ... didn't attempt *conscious* control of breathing to maintain awareness ... I let my breath "do it's own thing".
<br>
<br>
7)  After about 10-15 minutes, I noticed my body gradually numbing as if it was disappearing slowly.  At this point, I began getting the visual *Fireworks* of colorful swirls behind my eyelids.
<br>
<br>
<img alt="8)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cool.png" title="Cool"/>
Focused on the swirling visual Fireworks.  At some point, I lost consciousness, because I was snapped back to awareness that an *Energy Tunnel* had formed in my visual field (now 3D).
<br>
<br>
9)  Placed visual focus on the 3D energy tunnel, which extended to a small hole at the other end ... which had a male face (perhaps my own ... looked similar) peering back at me.  This brought my awareness back too quickly and my physical eyes started working, which brought me partially out of trance.  I reclosed my eyes and could still see into the 3D visual field of semi blackness, with some very, very mild glow to it.  Occasionally, I could see what appeared to be movement in the field, as if someone was moving around in front of me ... perhaps I was at the beginnings of Astral Sight of someone/thing in front of me in the Real Time Zone (physical plane), moving about.
<br>
<br>
10)  Finally, after waking up even more, I decide to get up.
<br>
<br>
Notes on the experience:
<br>
<br>
Total time spent doing the exercise was 45 minutes.  Approximate time to Astral Tunnel, was approximately 35 minutes.  I had seen the Astral Tunnel, the other day, more clearly ... it appeared as a blackish-grey mildly lighted *black hole* forming in front of me.
<br>
<br>
I think this was a successful attempt at reproducing the OBE Phasing state, which I accidentally experienced a year ago.  If I practice this proceedure regularly, with INTENT, I think I will learn to Phase into the Astral quite easily.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Are there any benefits of phasing into the Astral compared to a RTZ projection exit then into the astral from the RTZ?

<section>
Hi Alivie,
<br>
I'm sure that other members, with more phasing experience than I, can answer this better for you.  In the meantime, here's my take on it.
<br>
<br>
As I briefly mentioned, my initial two spontaneous OBE's were more a variant of Phasing, than the traditional OBE exit.  I had ZERO exit symptoms.  I simply experienced a few lucid dreams and then POOF! I was OBE ... First in the Real Time Zone, then Secondly in a vast black darkness.  I have since experienced various OBE exit phenomena, when attempting projections from a sleeping state.  So, the benefit of ZERO exit symptoms, when using Phasing, is nice.
<br>
<br>
The next benefit I notice, is that by maintaining and transferring my consciousness, from an awake state, I have sooooo much better awareness DURING the projection AND AFTERWARDS.  In my first two spontaneous projections, it was just like being *awake* in the OBE state ... unlike all my subsequent projections from being asleep ... my consciousness/awareness levels were all over the spectrum ... I never really ever had the awareness of those two initial spontaneous experiences.
<br>
<br>
So, that's my take on the use of Phasing, as opposed to the more traditional OBE exiting techniques (which I still use from with in the sleeping state).  Ever since those original 2 OBE's, with that high-level of conscious awareness, I have struggled to achieve, in my subsequent projections from sleep, that degree of awareness.  Not succeeding has been frustrating!  Now, I am getting closer!
<br>
<br>
So, to sum this post up ... PHASING BENEFITS ARE:
<br>
1)  Zero exit symptoms
<br>
2)  High-Level Awareness and Consciousness
<br>
 <br>
 I hope this explanation helps.
 <br>
 <br>
 Cheers!

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I tried phasing last night, using the Gateway CD (wave 1).
<br>
<br>
This is my ritual:  As Monroe takes me through the focus levels (1..........2..........3....... etc.) I imagine myself trotting down a long, wide, concrete hall with the focus levels painted in large numbers on either side of me  (I hope this is making sense . . . I tried imagining an elevator ride but it was too passive).
<br>
<br>
At the end of this wide hall is a big doorway with a "10" painted on it.  As many of you know, Monroe only takes you to Focus 10 in the Wave 1 series.  Well, phasing requires more than Focus 10 awareness, so as I approach the door it opens automatically (a sliding doorway), revealing a large concrete deck with and 11 painted on it, and, oddly, a blue velvet sofa (don't ask me, the sofa just showed up).
<br>
<br>
At the edge of the concrete deck is just stars . . .  the  Astral.  Out a ways is what looks like a huge, bright blue billiard ball with a 12 on it.
<br>
<br>
So, when Monroe gets to 10. . . . .10 . . . .10 . . . . I continue to jog to the edge of Focus 11 and then I jump into space and fly to the billiard ball.
<br>
<br>
I spent the other morning just kind of hugging the big thing, wondering what to do next.
<br>
<br>
tum tee tum . . . until next time
<br>

Yes, this is something I recognise very well. Plus, a lot of near-death experience bods talk of the same thing. You get it at around the Astral bridge zone at the Focus 21 stage.
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 is basically the bridge between Astral and Physical. It can often be viewed as crossing some kind of expanse, or moving through a tunnel, etc. Basically, if you feel a definite shift like you have moved from one place to another - then you just crossed the bridge zone. How each individual experiences that shift can vary. But moving through some kind of tunnel is a common way of perceiving it.

Hi Frank,
<br>
Thanks for the reply.  So, F21 .. IS .. the tunnel ... and by passing thru the tunnel (F21), I would end up in F22.  Is this correct thinking?
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Greg: yes, F21 stage is the tunnel. But people can perceive it differently, as I say. Also, don't be surprised if you start perceiving this stage in other ways as you become more familiar with the process.
<br>
<br>
At the tunnel exit is the Astral. Focus 22 is the next logical step but you can exit the tunnel anywhere within the Astral, of your choosing. What I'd suggest is for you to have a definite Intent as to where it is you want to go. Then hold that Intent firmly in mind as you approach the tunnel stage.

Well, it looks like I am onto something here ... I just came accross information on the SUNEYE-4 METHOD for projecting.  It is very similiar to what I'm doing and goes as follows.
<br>
<br>
1) 6/1 Sleep-Wake-Sleep method.  Sleep for 6 hours.  Get up for 1 hour.  Go back to sleep.
<br>
<br>
2) Sit-up method.  SIT UP in a semi reclined position so that the back is at 110-130 degrees (90 is vertical).  Support entire body and head so that relaxation can be achieved.  This forces brain to work differently than while laying down (for sleep).
<br>
<br>
3) Focus on 3rd eye chakra.  This helps to FOCUS all your thoughts into one and the 3rd eye is a key chakra for projection.  I end up naturally focusing on the 3rd eye because of the light permeating my eyelids.
<br>
<br>
4) Self-hypnotic suggestion like "I now go out-of-body" or "I now project to Focus 27" etc.  Said repeatedly while focusing on 3rd Eye.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, you doze off and end up projecting.  Supposedly, from the material I read, you end up having a highly conscious projeciton.  I am going to experiment with this over Christmas break and will post back more, in January.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Happy New Year everyone!
<br>
<br>
As promised, I am posting back with my expirements with Astral Phasing and use of the Suneye-4 Method.  I was able to attempt projections about 6 times and had one successful projection, as well as 3 very close successes at "getting out."  Here's the details of the "successful" projection.
<br>
<br>
Sat., Dec. 21th (in the AM):
<br>
<br>
Get up at 6:00 AM to feed Kira (newborn baby) and finally get positioned on the couch, ihn order to do the Suneye-4 Method.  I am sitting at 130-degrees reclined, supporting my head and neck with a pillow.  I am wrapped up in a blanket with my arms crossed and toes touching.  Prior to projectionI set the intent to 1) Meditate on Jesus  2) Turn around and see my physical body  3) To see our guardian angels around us.  I then focus on my 3rd eye and mentally repeat "I now go out of body."  It's 7:00 AM by the time I finally start dozing off.  I bet various visual imagery at times.  I saw a swirling mass or cloud of beautiful turquois and read, with sparkling white streaks of energy "wires" running all throughout it.  This was moving towards me, through outer space.  At another time, I saw a hole open in my visual field and I could see brilliant blue sky with clouds, through the hole.  I end up getting up at 7:20 AM to check on Kira (sleeping in car seat).
<br>
<br>
Once again, I sit back in the couch, resumming the position to project.  I fall asleep, using the same Suneye-4 Method and same 3 Intents.  I become aware that I can project, when I suddenly have astral vision of the living room.  At this point, I gain some consciousness, because I know that I am seeing through my closed eyelids.  Interestingly,  a road runner (bird) is on the floor.  As I pull away from my physcial body, I feel the separation and yet I can still feel my physical body on the couch (simultaneously &amp; after projection).  I start heading towards the kitchen and begin thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" and am suddenly shooting through "outer space", seeing various colored star bursts zooming past.  I am travelling at a tremendous speed, feeling the intense rush of movement at this speed as I travel "somewhere".  I then black out and am back in my body, regaining awareness that I can project.
<br>
<br>
This time, as I separate, when I get about 4-feet from my physical, I start to get pulled back.  So, I put my feet into a wide fore-aft stance, bend down and push forward with my "body weight", breaking free of the reverse pull of the Astral Silver Cord.  I was then free and moved towards the kitchen again.  At this point, I turned around to see my body and was having difficulty making myself out on the couch.  Instead of seeing "me", I was seeing an older (than me ... I'm 29 ... he's like 45-50), chubby guy, with slightly redding cheeks, glasses, etc. playing with Kira.  I'm having difficulty focusing on him, so I walk over.  There is a short loss of awareness and when I gain it back, there is yet a new guy on the couch.  He's small, 45-50, balding with messy hair and seems to be uncomfortable with my presence.  I am asking him, "Where is my body?" and "Who is he?" and "What is your name?"  He responds that he is a part of Greg's (me) subconscious and that he doesn't think Greg knows about him yet and that Greg hasn't given him a name.  He never does answer about where my physical body is.  SIDE NOTE:  I have only ONE TIME seen my body when projecting, and that from accross the room.  After this short conversation with the nervous man, I wake up.
<br>
<br>
I did have one other partial separation OBE over the holidays.  This was while lying in bed one morning, as my wife re-entered the bedroom to sleep in.  I heard her enter and at the same time, was separated from the physical, from the waist up.  My legs were "stuck" and I was flailing around in the air over the bed (no visuals) like a kite in a strong breeze.  I settled down and tried rolling out to the side, but felt like I was PHYSICALLY moving now, so I stopped.  Later on, I asked my wife if I was moving AT ALL when she came back to bed ... her response was NO.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Hi Shawn,
<br>
No, I haven't given "him" a name yet, as I am not convinced YET that he is truly a part of my SCM.  His unkempt appearance and nervousness are red flagsto me... that he could be an earthbound spirit.  More investigating on my part will reveal the truth.  If he is a part of me, then I'll learn all about him I can ... perhaps he is one of my past life personalities.  If he is an earthbound spirit (dead person ... not passed on), then I'll discover this and perhaps assist in his retrieval.  I've had enought questionable Astral Visitors, that I don't automatically receive what they say as "true" ... trust has to be earned, both here and "there."
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
