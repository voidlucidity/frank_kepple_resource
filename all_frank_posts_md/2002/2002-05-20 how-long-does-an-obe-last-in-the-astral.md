Frank / anyone else,
<br>
<br>
Just wanted to know how long a projection will last if it's not in the realtime zone. RB says realtime projections last less than 20min, based on energy production while OBE. Are you limited to the same amount of time when in the astral regions?
<br>
<br>
Thanks!

Hmm, it opens up an interesting idea of Astral Time that I'm sure has been thought of before but only just occured to me.
<br>
<br>
Aside from going into the definition of time and such, does anyone know if Astral Time and our perception of it corresponds with "Real Time"?

Time in the astral,
<br>
Interesting!
<br>
Must relate to the time available that we give. Â Is it not, that the astral is the ever present now, just translated to linear time?

Interesting question. I have found that Real Time (time on the physical plane) and Astral time are not always the same. To understand this, have you had a dream that seemed to last for years? Or live out a lifetime in your dream? You may remember details of the entire time seeming like you experienced these things for such a long period of time, yet you were only asleep for 8 hours (or however long). Likewise on the other end have you had a dream that was rather short but yet seemed last all night? Time really has little meaning on the Astral, from what I have experienced. When you understand this you will understand the irrelevence of your question. I am not trying to say anything bad about the question or you by saying this. I just want you to understand that how long a projection lasts is not as important as how well you actually remember the experience.

It is possible I might be misunderstanding, but it sounds to me like the question is not about the experiences in the astral and higher planes. Instead, it is about the side of the physical body. The question is about if the physical body can be left unattended by the astral body (energy copy ... I understand about the mind split effect) for longer than 20 minutes. I don't know the answer of what sets the limits, beyond that at some point the body will have needs. As it is common for people to sleep 8 consecutive hours, though, it sounds to me like the physical body can be set aside for at least that long rather than just 20 minutes. As someone still working toward learning to project, though, my opinion can't be worth much on the subject.

There is no such thing as "time" on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Naturally, you bring a "sense of time" with you that is picked up from living on the physical, but it can easily get distorted. Like, in scientific experiments where a person is isolated from outdoors, and anything else that can give them a sense of time like a radio or a TV.
<br>
<br>
What happens is they tend to develop weird sleep patterns, and so forth. Plus, they lose track of the ability to hold in mind the idea of time passing. In the sense that 5-minutes can seem like an hour, or an hour can seem like 5-minutes, and such like.
<br>
<br>
You can be on the Astral for what feels like hours. However, in terms of physical earth-time, you may have been projecting only ten minutes.
<br>
<br>
As for the maximum time you can project, I never did any real studies on this. But you are subject to physical-body demands in a big way. That is why it is essential to make sure the physical body is properly supported and is not too hot or too cold, etc.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I will be right in the middle of a great Astral adventure and I get the feeling the Physical has some problem or other. Often I get pulled back automatically. I enter the physical and it's like, "Now what the heck do you want this time?"
<br>
<br>
I may have rolled onto my side, or the dogs are barking, or my wife got up, or whatever. In a sense it is comforting to know there is such a high degree of communication with the physical whilst you are "out" so to speak. But it can be mighty frustrating as well.

<section>
i think when he says time he means the perceived time out, to the concious observer. like how RB instructs the first time projection to be "10 seconds maximum," this isn't the physical time, but the noted time frame by the projected double...
<br>
im still working on my 1st obe, and i am also wondering how 'long' you can stay out in the real time zone..does it seem like 20 minutes? 30 minutes?

Thanks all - I originally meant the question in the sense of subjective time (ie, are there limits to how long the projector can sense themselves engaging in Astral experiences) but was going to follow-up with the physical-time part of it as this is important in other ways. The real point of the question is, are there any limits at all to the astral experience in the same way that energy seems to be the limit of the realtime zone? Doesn't seem like there are, apart from the usual body alerts, etc. Which is kind of encouraging...

Wish I knew...unfortunately I seem bound to the real-time zone only. =(

There are no limits as to how long a projector can sense themselves engaging in Astral experiences. As I say, you do bring with you a "sense of time" from experiencing life in the physical. But the sensation is meaningless on the Astral due to the fact that there is no time. Ten minutes of earth-time, on the Astral, can seem like anything from mere seconds to eternity.
<br>
<br>
There are also no limits at all as to what you can experience on the Astral. It is an infinite place where anything and everything is possible. That is the glorious wonder, and the humungous danger of the place.
<br>
<br>
The primary restriction you have are physical-body demands. These can be minimised by making sure it is comfortable whilst you are "away".
<br>

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I don't have time right now to provide a detailed or very relevant answers to the questions posed, so I will just copy/paste part of a small article I wrote for a friend regarding consciousness. In relation to this thread, note the explanations of time/space for each sphere of existance.
<br>
<br>
Be well

<br>
Consciousness exists on 3 basic levels:
<br>
<br>
The Physical world - What we see and what we perceive through our 5 senses. This world is subject to the laws of physics and its environment and is limited by the concepts of time and space. We all know how much of the physical world works, so no need to go into details here.
<br>
<br>
The Mental world - This is the world where we experience thought. The Newtonian laws of physics don't really apply here. While there is a concept of time, there is no concept of space here (i.e. when we think, the act of thinking takes up linear time as we understand it, but we can think of being on mars or on some galaxy we invented in our heads, thus why space does not exist here - the boundaries we encounter are only limited by our imagination). When we close our eyes (whether awake or asleep), when we shut off our 5 senses, there is still thought. This is a world which permeates and exists as part of the physical world (we can have thought simultaneously as we interpret reality through our 5 senses). This world or level of consciousness however can also exist sole on its own. As strange as it may seem, it is possible to literally shut off the 5 senses and exist purely as thought (this is one of the things you learn in advanced meditational stages and is taught in certain types of Yoga).
<br>
<br>
The Astral world - Otherwise known as "the beyond", the spiritual world, etc. Consciousness here knows no boundaries. There is neither a concept of time nor space here. Your essence, your consciousness has always existed and forever shall exist on this plane. And while most people are not aware of its existence, from a logical point of view it partially explains concepts such as clairvoyancy (looking into the past or future of yourself or somebody else) - this "supernatural" ability is accomplished in part by tapping into this level of consciousness (whether the person doing it is aware of this or not). This also explains things like psychic channeling (where somebody invokes a spirit from the beyond and can ask them questions and they answer through their physical mouth, or through writing etc). The Astral plane has been written about by the 4 corners of the world for over 15,000 years. From Egyptian hiropglyphs, to the Hindu Gita in India, to Native North American Indian stories, Ancient Chinese Taoism / Tibetan Buddhism. It is the core of all religions belief. It can allow for the explanation of GOD. Â Further research into this level of conciousness written about by the highest revered spiritual/philosophical members of these very different cultures reveals even more amazement. This "Astral Plane" is further divided into many other layers, or levels of consciousness.

Grenade01, have you tried to deliberately create reality fluctuations? Going through solid objects or reflective objects such as mirrors could help. Also, travel is limited in the real-time zone to what feels natural so if you exceed that speed reality fluctuations can be created. This is usually an obstacle to staying in the real-time zone. There is also the method decribed of putting a place you would like to create so that it will be reflected in a mirror and going into the image. Symbols such as tarot cards and runes would work just as well.

Sort of...
<br>
Once I got sucked into a swirley poster I have...
<br>
<br>
But like
<br>
Im usually very confused when I exit. Â Usually it seems like Im just appearing there..kind of the way you wake up in the morning... fortunately as soon as its over I can remember most or all of the exit..but its like... thats only once my obe body downloads into my physical body and the two connect at that point in time...
<br>
I think my problem is my physical body isnt downloading into my obe body ...lol
<br>
but yeah
<br>
like i was saying im usually confused..by the time i figure out in obe i usually get pulled back
<br>
a lot of times Ill have a purpose, but it will all but vanish as I always have this undeniable urge to look out my window. Â I always feel like theres something outside ....
<br>
I swear...something not good..like its fixed and always there..but I have never been able to look out my window..its like I cant..I have gone through walls before without it causing any reality flux..I have looked in mirrors (curiously I dont see anything even though I can look down at my weird melty hands) Â I have gone down stairs..but I just cant look at this spot in my back yard
<br>
<br>
it really seems my obe's are literally as close to the real physical as possible. Â I mean nothing is ever out of place.. when I pass through walls its very hard...they are sticky...i can feel objects even though I cant pick them up. Â They kind of sog through my hands more like quicksand then like air.
<br>
<br>
its kind of funny. Â I bet if i could actually stop being so damn confused when i got out..I could easily prove obe since they are always so close to reality.
<br>
But I just have this confusing problem no matter how much i prepare or how much energy i have raised..
