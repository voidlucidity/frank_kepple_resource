Hey,
<br>
<br>
I have been mulling over this for a while now. Has any experienced projectors ever held an "astral meeting"? I mean, actually meeting a fellow projector at a pre-arranged time and place? If so, does one meet in an astral plane which is selected or *created*, or even the real-time zone?
<br>
<br>
Also, I have heard that dream meetings are generally not viable, especially from reading on alt.out-of-body or alt.dreams.lucid - so would astral meetings, provided that they are a reality, prove that lucid dreams (of the WILD variety) are different to OBEs?
<br>
<br>
Robert, I would like to ask you this: How and when did you discover the plane entrance structures? I have read Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of Body and his accounts of the astral planes don't seem as organised. Do you think that the plane structure is dependant of the belief system of the individual? I mean, what are the chances of a projector finding the entrance structure without prior knowledge of it?
<br>
<br>
Additionally, Monroe talked about what he calls Locale III, which was entered through a black-hole type structure after rotating when out-of-body. According to him, it was like a mirror universe, except the society evolved quite differently. Also, Monroe was able to inhabit an individual's body while in this plane/universe and caused quite a lot of grief and confusion. Has anyone ever experienced anything remotely similar?
<br>
<br>
And my final question, would any "seasoned" projectors consider trying out astral meetings? It could prove a valuabe and fun little excursion

G'day!
<br>
<br>
Yes, astal meetings can be held, in real time or in astral realms. But the difficulty of course is to find two people who can reliably project at roughly the same time.  Occult societies meet in the astral all the time. They usually have prepared realms in which to meet.
<br>
<br>
If two people are more than a few miles apart, using an astral realm is easier, to avoid too many reality fluctuations, etc.
<br>
<br>
It is also possible for a projector (if they have the skill) to enter the dreams of another person. But this would not prove the difference beween LD/WILD and OBE.  The only way to really tell the difference is by monitoring the seemingly physical sensations associated with the start of each type of experience. For example, during OBE exit there are vibrations, rapid heartbeat and other chakra type sensations, and a distinct feeling of separation.  During LD or WILD, none of the above are present, but REM (rapid eyemovement) is often present.  You would probably need to be hooked up to an EEG machine to really tell the difference. But, basically, unless OBE exit symptoms are felt, you are in some kind of dream.
<br>
<br>
No, the astral plane surface skin is a 'set' type of structure.  I have no idea why Monroe missed these, but I dont' think belief has much to do this matter. I had no preconceived ideas of what the astral planes looked like, or even that there was such a thing as a surface skin entrance structure, until I stumbled upon it one day during an OBE. Note that in my early days I, like Sylvan Muldoon, found myself stuck in the real time zone.  I did not find a way into the astral planes until I was much older.  I still project into real time, and stay there unless I deliberately enter the astral planes.
<br>
<br>
Most people tend to slip into specific parts of the astral planes, into astral realms, which does not allow the surface skin structure to be perceived.  and moving about among realms, from the inside, also does not allow the surface skin structure to be perceived.
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is possible for a strong projector to enter the body of another person. I have done it.  This can be likened to temporary possession. I have dealt with this in my new book, PPSD, because it relates to the topic of possession.  I do not, however, provide the technique whereby this can be achieved, for obvious reasons.  However, this is way, way beyond the capabilities of average projectors.
<br>
<br>
I may try to organize some joint OBE meetings later this year.  I have no time at all to do this now.
<br>
<br>
Take care, Robert.

<section>
Robert (and anyone else with experience in this matter),
<br>
<br>
After reading your reply to Conn re: Astral meetings, I'm curious.
<br>
<br>
(1) How would a projector enter someone's dreams?
<br>
<br>
(2) Would the dreamer necessarily remember the dream with the projector in it?
<br>
<br>
(3) Is there a way to help ensure the dreamer would remember the dream?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
James
<br>
<br>
By the way -- love the new forums!

(Again) Yes Astral meeting (group target location-s) are held, quite a large group of us "Monroers" (Monroe Institute grads) have been doing it for years every Thursday night.....
<br>
<br>
As a rule we "shift" move, phase, vibrate, (personally I catch the wave) whatever you want to call it,  on to one of R Monroe's focus levels and meet and greet, do whatever compare notes afterwards.
<br>
<br>
Astral planes /levels as I experience them (my/a different perspective or belief) are more akin to a membrane, (it seems to resist or contain (solid stable) at first, but on the other hand not really.. illusion)  they can be, (actually just pushed thru when you get the hang of it), merged thru, meshed with, shifted thru, rolled thru, matched.. sometimes I run into what I call a torus (donut tube) to a worm hole. That stuff is kinda solid again, but again 'not really'. (belief/illusion/perspective).
<br>
<br>
Push yourself, beliefs and limits most give way quite easily, not too much really solid 'out there'.
<br>
<br>
(energy) Lines grids/ seem everywhere if your perspective is focused on or below construct. (you are definitely OOB and more, out of bodies perhaps)
<br>
They are around the planet/ planets, they are everywhere.
<br>
Around the planet they are thick to thin then thick again, then astral levels or constructs seem to have endless ones stretching beyond distance.
<br>
If you find yourself, get stuck in one (the flat lands) and are very perceptive (sensual feeling) you can push thru to the next and many times the energy flow, is flowing opposite, or reversed.
<br>
Color experience, impression will range from geometric (and I didn't say geometrics in color), to void, de-void, rapid flows with sparkly bits (energetic movement/flux).. flat-ness to and all the while 360degree height width compounded and everything compounds upon everything.. and it's all realer than real.
<br>
<br>
Entering another person real time or dream time, mind time, etheric..
<br>
I call it, laying in.
<br>
You (can) target the person, then match the or their vibrations, you sink into them, softly match them, breathe with them, you share space with them. You are merged with them, you know them, you know you, you are very close to almost one, you don't really know where one begins and the other leaves off...
<br>
The best way to practice this is (daily) with verifiable feedback, some seemed more skilled than others, for me it came very easily.
<br>
<br>
If you want to do anything or get anywhere, for me it's easiest to (just) match the vibrations of the target.
<br>
(I become it and it... comes to me)
<br>
A target can be anything a belief, a person, event (OOB), a real time location, a non local  (any etheric) (belief).
<br>
<br>
Just my experience..  ~T~

<font face="Verdana">
 This is my first post and I can relate what it is like for the dreamer.  I will do my best to remember the details.  It happened 13 years ago ... around this time.  Wait!  Today is when J. and I began our little rendevous in dreamtime.  I maybe should not have started trying to AP now because of seriously deranged things that occurred 13 years ago.  But I digress.
 <br>
 <br>
 First off, I have had several conscious APs but most of my experience is in astral planes not real time.  I do not remember how I get there.  When I met J. we discovered we were both psychic.  He told me he could enter my dreams and said he could prove it.  I said, ok, prove it.
 <br>
 <br>
 That night he came to me.  J was 16 and I was a year younger at this time.  I do not understand how he did it but we had fun.  (We went flying in a helicopter.)  We developed a strong connection(at times I still dream of him).  The next day I asked him to relay what happened in the dreams.  He was right on the button!  A day or so later he told me he was part of an occult group that could do this and I was a part of it.  Whether he was serious is unknown to me even today.  But one dream in particular comes to mind right now for some reason.
 <br>
 <br>
 I was standing at a tunnel or entrance of some kind.  J was to the right and behind me.  A man in a brown robe and tan rope tied around his waist was instructing me.  Other dreamers, who knew J and somehow knew me, were standing a ways off.  I was suppose to go trought this entrance or whatever it was.  I smiled to myself and felt safe.  The next day J asked me why I had looked over my right shoulder at him and smiled.  I told him becasue I knew he was with me, sharing something I wouldn't understand until much later(like now).  When I pressured him about why I was doing these things in my dreams, he said I would understand in time.  In a way my mind knows.  What this dream or whatever it was meant is still vague so any thoughts or ideas are most welcome.
 <br>
 <br>
 Anyway, J told me he had to have permission from me before he could enter my mind/dream.  He told me there are portals that go to other planes.  I have never remembered going through one but I think they exist.  I wonder if when a person projects they automatically go through a portal witout realizing it, heading straight for the astral plane from real time.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another time, years after J and I had to break up due to my family, I wanted to dream with him.  I was not APing(that I know of) and started yelling his name in the dream.  I did this for several days and one night he was there.  He told me he still loved me(I told him I still did as well).
 <br>
 <br>
 Although I am a novice projector I have experience with being the dreamer.  I do not know exactly HOW it is done but I know it CAN be.
 <br>
 <br>
 I hope this makes sense.  I am having trouble with the "h" key on my keyboard.  Stubborn little sucker!

Hahahaha.. Yes, (!!) your J is/was/is IMO quite talented, some would say an advanced skill.
<br>
This is hard (creative), it takes a lot of discipline and energy, requires trust and agreement on both ends(IMO)..
<br>
I have experienced the very same via the most talented person, freiend/teacher I have ever known or heard of.
<br>
I had only first hand knowledge of one other who could do this, prior to your post.
<br>
(Linking) Sharing anothers... beingness and space (OOB, co-dreaming, (co)creating), the mind and spirit have or are many levels or layers, (self)guarded would be the descriptive I guess. We even tho not awares, we are very hard to get into
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
, so even if we say yes on the outside we may say no inside on or at another level and visaversa. We are amazing pieces of work, akin to looking thru a glass onion
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
(you wrote) "Anyway, J told me he had to have permission from me before he could enter my mind/dream. He told me there are portals that go to other planes. I have never remembered going through one but I think they exist."
<br>
<br>
What J describes as portals some would call levels, layers barriers/containments, (controlling factors).. apertures.
<br>
(IME the energy(vibration) just gets finer and finer, the more in-ward you go or shift, the more 'one' (all) you become or match. Some will place (create/belief/believe) hoops and rings to jump thru (i.e. portals, levels, colors, etheric plane/divisions), others like myself do away with that and just merge/blend thru what I call a barely there if at all membrane(effect), it's just a difference of sensory energy feel/perception.
<br>
<br>
That you never remember going thru any of the portals indicates to me that they were (of) his belief structure, and it also indicates to me( based on personal experience) that he was the (main) dreamer. (and pulling you along). All of this is done OOB IMO. He being the dreamer would have the better or greater recall of the 'dream' as actually it was of his creation, origination, and you were coming along for the experience, the ride, also he could have 'linked' and let you take the lead, make the creation, the "dream", still.. his skill are what enable the experience.
<br>
<br>
The co"dreams" should be verifiable, they are quite vivid and a pristine energetic realer than real quality.
<br>
You can also communicate 'there', and recall it here, the communication surfacing much like a subliminal for the receiver.
<br>
<br>
I enjoyed your post, thanks for sharing

<br>
yes it's true and verifiable in real time, either between the two parties involved or uninvolved (blind) 3 parties,  individual reports could be sent to the 3rd parties for evaluation.
<br>
<br>
Some would call this the dreaming space some would call it co-OOBE's.

 I cannot talk about these sort of things with my mom or sister(AND DEFINITELY NOT MY FATHER).  To a certain extent I have felt alone in this respect.  It is difficult to relay the experience to them because they have not felt the sensations/feelings/thoughts that I have.  I realized he was the one creating the dream.  Your response has renewed my resolve that others have experienced this sort of thing.  Although J and I have not dreamt together in a quite a while, I treasure those experiences.  It was spiritual while being fun.

  LadyLea,
  <br>
  Just an idea: in case you lost contact with J and would like to find him, would you like to try to do it by using AP? It should be possible (I hope). The reason I suggest this is that I want to do exactly this: to find a former friend of mine whom I didn't see many years, and I don't have any info (phone# or location, or even exact family name). I currently try to master conscious OBE so that I could use it for my goal. I think it would be
  <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile_cool.gif"/>
  .
  <br>
  To all: Did anybody have some OBE that was practically useful? Like finding something... or whatever?
  <br>
  Thanks.

Hi!
<br>
<br>
I just wonder is vibrations ETC. always present when OBE occurs??
<br>
Because my OBE´s are always without them.I just pull out of my body
<br>
without vibrations and they always start when leaving my body and
<br>
ends when i´m back.But I got often these symptoms when I try OBE fully
<br>
awaken state but never can´t go further!?SO I can leave my body only
<br>
somewhere middle of sleep and waking state, TRANCE I thing.Please tell
<br>
opinions about that

Hi!
<br>
<br>
Telecaster: as I experienced, the vibrations always present when you go out of body. Some times later you simply don't feel them, but they still there are. Just try to find the vibs, you will be able to focus on them.
<br>
<br>
The most hard ability to achieve is staying conscious during obes.
<br>
It makes easier if you practice energy raising.

 Very interesting, because after having spent almost 20 years zooming off and wondering where I would end up, I am gradually beginning to control the experience but it's slow going. Your experiences seem to be the definition of controlled and I wondered if you could please clarify further about "matching the vibrations of a target".
 <br>
 <br>
 Basically, I cannot grasp how the target vibrations are determined. And, if I may ask, when you say "match"... match them with what? Your own vibrations? I mean the vibrations typically felt prior to projection? Or are there other vibrations coming into play?
 <br>

 Any pointers gratefully received.
