Hi...
<br>
I have been studying OBE's but have not done one yet. I have gone to psychics and have told them I am now into OBEing and wish to accomplish this. Everyone of them had told me not to do this as I will encounter dark entities that could make me go insane. They recommend I seek a Shaman to correct the darkness within myself first before I attempt this.
<br>
That my own darkness can become my evil I will be forced to deal with. Hmmm...
<br>
<br>
They also said I should seek someone of great experience in OBEing to guide me and show me the way.
<br>
<br>
Can someone please comment on this? As I don't know what to believe due to being new at this. I have read some articles on other websites that talk about the harm that could come to one.
<br>
<br>
Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
<br>

I'd say your friends are most likely regurgitating something they have heard or are telling you this because they have had negative experiences with OBEs.
<br>
<br>
That is basically trash... I'm not saying it wont be frightening (hell I havent had one yet and ive had scary experiences) but the only thing you have to fear is fear itself. Truly

In part they are right, but you need to understand the astral to understand why. The astral is made of emotions, it is your personality that makes the environment there. This may sound weird to someone who does not know about astral travel but you need to know that what you experience is part of you. In other words here on the physical your personality is on the inside and you do not have to deal with it directly, or at all sometimes. On the astral your personality is on the outside. It forces you do deal with you. So if you encounter something negative on the astral it is more than likely some kind of fear that you have. If you are a very negative person your astral experiences will be mostly negative. So to have a more pleasant astral experience you need to deal with yourself first. Work through this dark part of yourself. If you do not do it first then you will have to sometime while you are out of body. Dealing with it while out of body can be theroputic but for someone who is inexperienced it can be somewhat harmful unless you understand what is going on.
<br>
<br>
Know and remember this, YOU CANNOT BE HURT WHILE OUT OF BODY. Your astral body is indestructible compared to your physical body. So the only thing you need to fear is fear itself. The only way that something can hurt you is to make you scared, which really does not hurt you other than causing you to be overcome with fear. Do not worry if you should become afraid, even the most experienced astral traveler gets surprises now and then. It is just part of it.
<br>
<br>
The best thing you can do to prepare is to honestly sit down and look at yourself, even the parts you do not want to face. Explore who you really are. Also try to control your emotions. They can be much more extreme when out of body so control is needed. If you have control then you will not get as scared and be overcome with fear, though it will still happen sometimes. Controling your emotions on the physical will make it easier for when you are out of body.
<br>
<br>
Good Luck!
<br>
<br>
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.

Basically, what you have been advised is correct within the context in which it is meant.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what a "Shaman" is exactly, but I do know that your own "darkness" (by that I take it you mean any kind of destructive emotive intent) will most certainly become an evil that you will have to deal with, on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
In fact, there are many Internet forums containing people who are having to do just that, and often on a daily basis. Plus, there is only so much the mind can take before what is generally considered to be normal behavioural functioning, becomes increasingly impaired.
<br>
<br>
But if you are a generally upbeat and reasonably happy person, then you should have no real major problem setting foot on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I understand what you mean. This is the way I felt before I took time to understand how it really works, because I was so afraid of the unknown.
<br>
<br>
My mother, who was the first person to tell me that it all could be very dangerous (without knowing why) is now asking me with excitment about my experiences.
<br>
<br>
Just like Steveb did, I suggest that you read the whole post "Astral Danger" which helped me a lot and taught me that I could do some work on myself to feel better in the Astral. As you will see in that post, I had so many questions and fears. Now I can say that, knowing more how it works, I feel more confident and I WANT to surmount my fears.
<br>
<br>
You know what? I think it is worth it a thousand times.

What these people have said reflects their ignorance o the subject.  To give you an idea of how absurd this really is you need to remember that most of us spend time in the mental/astral planes at night when we sleep, at least to  some degree.
<br>
<br>
This would be like a reculse who never left her house being afraid to go outside because she might run into criminals and unfriendly people....

PeacefulWarrior,
<br>
<br>
You have brought an interesting question to mind. Are your dreams and obes are similar? What I mean by this is if you dream good happy things are your projections usually the same. Or if you dream about negative things are your obe similar?
<br>
<br>
I rarely remember my dreams but when I do they are usually neutral or good and pleasant. I have not had a nightmare in a long time. I might have dreams that are dark but I have not experienced any fear. Though I have not had a lot of OBEs I have not had any negative fearful experiences. So do you think that when we dream and project that we are drawn to the same levels of the astral?
<br>

<section>
I have not yet had an OBE.  I have been steered away from it by people trying to instill fear,  as I said in my original post.
<br>
<br>
I too don't normally remember my dreams and also have not had a nightmare for a long time. Though I am dealing with a lot of stress in my life currently like loss of job, ended relationship, moving 3 times in 4 months and also dealing with a health problem that I have been to many doctors whom could not tell me a for sure answer to what is the culprit. So, maybe they are right!
<br>
<br>
Does anyone have anything positive remarks on this? Help? Would it be benificial to me to go against the grain and do it anyway? Do you think that if I did go ahead with astral projection that I could find out the real answer to my health problem? Or anything else I need answers to?
<br>
<br>
Well, Lots of questions, but you can get a better idea of where I am coming from.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who put in any positive suggestions or advice!
<br>
<br>

<section>
Well I would say that the stress might be hurting your health. Stress, especially a lot of it, can really bring your health, physical and emotional, down. Try dealing with this stress and you may find that your health improves. Try to relax and meditate. Nightmares can be from all your stress as well, especially if you are doing a lot of worrying. If you wish to proceed with trying to astral project then go for it. You cannot be hurt by it and it might be good for you to deal with things on the astral. Just do not fear anything that you might experience. I would say that you very well might experience some negativity when you project as it sounds like your life is rather chaotic right now. But this can be good to work through. Remember you cannot be hurt while projecting. Just try to see the truth of the experience and look for higher things. Disreguard the ignorance these people have told as they seem to know nothing about astral projection.
<br>
GOOD LUCK!
