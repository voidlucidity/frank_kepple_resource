My first OBE doesn't count because I got Astral tricked back into my body.
<br>
<br>
I woke up this morning and did NEW, then had a bath and thought I would get some meditation in while not being disturbed at all.  Havent managed some free time in a month.  I think at the back of my mind I was intending to have an OBE.  So I got into bed, put my eyeshades on as the sun was shining bright in my room.  Put some earplugs in, just in case the cat started making a fuss or some double glazing salesman chanced to knock on the door.  Was perfect, I was relaxed from my bath, knew the phone wouldn't ring for a few hours, and being lovely and sunny I had no fears.  I was so cosy, I probably fell asleep but became conscious at some stage when this old man started talking to me, probably in a dream, but for some reason I felt my lungs start to be squeezed which kind of woke me up.  Then, without any warning I felt the vibrations, and I was instantly alert.  I concentrated hard on not getting scared and just sinking into them.  Those vibrations shook me to the core, I felt myself being pulled backwards into them and then float upwards a little bit.  Suddenly it was quiet I opened my eyes but I saw the back of my eyeshades and realised I'd opened my physical eyes, I quickly shut them hoping I hadn't blown it. So I tried to get out of my body - nothing happened - I got frightened.  I was in some sort of void, couldn't feel anything anywhere, couldn't move, couldn't see.  I thought
<i>
 now you've really done it, you're going to be floating around in no-man's land for eternity
</i>
.  But even as I thought this, I started feeling something.  Still couldn't see anything but I remembered from a previous dream to remove my eyeshades, which I did.
<i>
 Several dreams I have had (may have been OBE's) where I cant see, I got the idea to physically remove what was blocking my sight, which works for me
</i>
.  I can now see and find myself carefully crawling on my hands and knees down to the end of the bed - I was so scared of making any sudden movements and finding myself back in my body.  Who knows if I can manage do this again?  Anyway, I note with dissapointment that my room is dark (in reality it was filled with sunshine).  There is a spotlight above the bed.  I carefully crawl further down the bed, there is a notepad lying there in the rumpled covers, I thought
<i>
 that's strange
</i>
.   I wonder what will happen when I crawl onto it.  It makes a crackling paper noise just as it would if it was real - I'm impressed.  There was something on the pad but I couldn't make out what it was, or maybe I was just more interested in the changes to my room, wanted to take it all in before it ended.  My bedroom door was not where it should have been.  It was now at the end of my bed and open, through it I could see there was some clutter lying on the floor in the hall.  I sat up and looked out the window.  Another dissapointment.  There was not the expected landscape.  I could still see lots of trees but they werent the same trees and the colours were all wrong, too much blue.
<i>
 I realised the scene was reminiscent of the oil painting that I am working on at the moment
</i>
.  So I crawled back up the bed on the other side.  There was a small crystal type of spotlight on the wall above the bed where I lay.  I went to touch it but it quickly moved to the side and switched off.  I could see it, hiding in the shadows.  The wide beam of light that it had shed was still there and was solid.  I reached out and touched it, it was like cotton wool, I wrapped it around me like you would try on a coat.  I took it off.  Then I suddenly couldn't breath - there was something wrong with my lungs and I was feeling quite ill, I clutched my chest.  Next thing,  I was instantly back in my body behind my real eyeshades and I had to physically cough.  I'm lying there quite excited at what had happened but even as I try to recall details they were fading.  The memory was more dreamlike than most of my dreams, apart from the physical feelings I had experienced.  I am so dissapointed...  I guess I expected too much.  I was hoping to see the sunshine and found my room was dark.  I did not feel well through the whole episode, but I've just remembered in Astral Dynamics Robert says to move away from your body.  I dont remember seeing my body but I was crawling around myself or where my body would have been.  Again I was too interested to take everything in to actually look at myself.  And the way the memory quickly fades, even before I am quite back in my body was also a dissapointment.  I feel like I have achieved something but it was not what I expected.

Hi Tia!
<br>
<br>
I'm happy for you, and I can relate to the disappointment too! It's like, it's a blast and expands my sense of what is possible and what might be real (very very cool) but on the other hand I want to travel the universe, meet a guide, see the light, and get absolute verification of it all to boot.
<br>
<br>
Still, each excursion is a 'step into a greater universe' or something, right?
<br>
<br>
Congrats again!
<br>
<br>
Patty

Thanks Patty,  you just hit the nail on the head.  I've been wondering why I'm so dissapointed and it's because if the environment is so intangable, it cant be verified, as in I can never prove a  thing.  I'm remembering your card tests and the way they changed infront of your eyes, I now totally understand that.

Hi!  It sounds as though you were "out," (to me "out" is a relative term) but during the experience your emotions/expectations/etc. might have been creating a picture show for you.
<br>
<br>
Whenever I have an otherworldly experience that rides the fence between OBE and lucid dream, I have a field day analyzing the imagery!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing,

Tia, well done for getting thus far and I'm not one for pouring cold water on your fire, but realise the Astral enviroment is very tangible. Just as tangible as the Physical environment. Perhaps even more so, as there are no earthquakes, no bad weather conditions, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
The sole cause of the intangibility is you. This is obvious from reading your post, where you are making all kinds of judgements and have all manner of expectations. Your surroundings are flitting here, there and everywhere which is hardly surprising considering. You need to please concentrate more on becoming totally still. Both in body (Astral) and in mind.
<br>
<br>
Next time you find yourself in the "void" as you call it, instead of getting scared simply ask those who are guiding you for more clarity, and maybe a little soothing music. Or whatever.
<br>
<br>
The point being, you can just ask for whatever it is you need for you to feel comfortable. If you feel scared, then ask those who are guiding you for more understanding. As you gain more understanding, your fear will dissipate completely. This will allow your sense of curiosity to guide you, and that's when you really start to make progress.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Well done Tia!
<br>
I can relate to the frustration also. I have not OBE'd using any conscious technique so far but have had 4 OBE's since trying from waking with full (noisy, quite violent) vibrations out of my sleep.
<br>
In my last exit, I moved away from my body and through my bedroom wall and thought that I had kept it in my (real) time zone, but , however, things were quite different. I seemed to be in some sort of 'dream' area where there were a lot of people that I know, going about their business and paying no attention to me floating above them. I asked for my guide to come forward but nobody came.
<br>
Very dissapointing really but I should be glad that I managed to exit again (it has been quite a while since the last one).
<br>
I had been visited by 3 'light' beings on my very first OBE, but was so alarmed that I did not hang around to communicate. I could have kicked myself when I later thought about it.
<br>
In my OBE's since, although I have come across others, they seem to be unreal if you know what I mean, as if they are dreamers in their dreams. I don't know, I still have a lot to learn and would like to OBE more frequently so as to be a bit more comfortable.
<br>
Oh well, we all strive for more but really it is the most amazing accomplishment is it not?

<br>
It has certainly changed my life around.
<br>
All the very best to you, and I'm sure that you will have many more.

Hi Tisha,
<br>
<br>
I did have a field day analyzing.  What was very interesting to me was that I went to bed the other night and glanced over to see the bedroom door was open - and I saw the clutter in the hall!  Exactly as I had seen it in my "otherworldly experience".  It was a bag and some files which have been there so long I just hadn't noticed them anymore.
<br>
<br>
Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
You are not pouring cold water on any fire, your comments always appreciated.  The problems I had with this experience are things I need to deal with in my day to day life.  I get terrified if I'm not in control and I do make instant judgements based on emotion rather than logic and observation - am working on it.  I will definately ask for some guidance next time!
<br>
<br>
Hi Spike,
<br>
<br>
Very interesting, your visitation by "light' beings.  I say I would love to be visited but in truth I would probably freak right out.  I think that each experience teaches us so much - when I first joined this forum I was only interested in the Energy work.  For me personally, I have broken such an incredible fear and belief barrier by leaving my physical body (and I didn't die!) that I just have to wonder what else there is?  And you cant be told these things - you have to experience them...

Hi Tia,
<br>
You are right, when I first discovered this forum, I was only interested in OBE'ing. But since I have been interested in these things over the last few years, I have been working on energy work, healing, developing my psychic senses (which has been the most interesting development so far- and easiest to develop I suppose). There is just so much to learn.
<br>
I really feel that I have spent so much of my life with a blindfold on. (I was quite late in accepting the strange phenomenon that happened sporadically to me), but as I have accepted it, so it has developed (and quite rapidly too!)
<br>
My beliefs have changed quite extremely as I have had them radically altered by my experiences. I can not convince anyone else of what has happened to me, and do not try to 'preach' either. But I am profoundly changed.
<br>
(Believe me, from being a 'beer swilling biker' who believed in nothing else but a good party to an open minded smiley person who accepts life and enjoys it all, whatever it is. Hahaha, it still makes me laugh how much I have changed!) (Although I still love a beer or two!:o)
<br>
Anyway, I suppose that what I am trying to say is that it is a life changing experience even though you might not be able to do what you first envisaged. There really is life out of your body and that is a truth that only you and I and a few others know(compared to the rest of the planet) and that is a thing that changes everything in how you live your life.

I can relate to your experiences I'm at the same stage as you, had many type of dream states that look like obe's ie getting out of the body but turned out to be a virtual world of the real world because of the anomalies in it.  I think my last obe was a real one though check out the message header many virtual obe's I wrote about my complaints jeff wrote some interesting things to do which are some easy ways to obe for real, if you have dreams where you can have atleast some awareness you are dreaming and can control it a bit ie stare at a fixed object then you can obe out of your dream easily.  If I do obe on a consistent basis and want to be certain it would be wise like in robert's book to get a deck of cards pick a card at random and put it somewhere where you won't see it til you obe then check afterwards to see if it's the real physical plane you obe'd into.
