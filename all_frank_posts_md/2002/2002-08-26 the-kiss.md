<section>
I had the most weird experience during this afternoon's snooze.  Found myself to be having a bit of an erotic dream.  I was kissing/being kissed, by whom/what I couldn't see.  In the midst of this kiss I found there was a small section of tomatoe in my mouth, and also a small sliver of onion, as though I had just put a spoonful of salad in my mouth.  I rolled this tomatoe over my tongue and could taste the tangy flavour and feel the texture in great detail.  Suddenly I became a little more aware and thought this was not normal, even within a dream.  I found that I couldn't see too well but I reached out to grab what I had been interacting with and felt something like a parrots beak.  As I pulled it towards me it seemed to elongate in my hands, the top half of the beak becoming a long curve stretching as I pulled it towards me.  I felt further down and felt what appeared to be fine feathers or hair off very thin and sinewy arm/leg?  I could not even explain what I had in my hands, it was totally alien to me.  I then pulled it right up to my face so that I could see it clearly.  I then seemed to open my eyes, I could see that I was in bed and I noticed the bedroom window in the background, but I could not see my hands in front of my face or what I was holding even though I knew they were right there in front of me.  Then it suddenly hit me that I was in a lucid situation and I thought to immediately try to project while I had this opportunity.  I let go of the 'thing' and seemed to inch my legs up the bed until they were underneath me and I tried to jump as hard as I could to leave my body.  It didn't work, it was like being stuck in toffee.  I couldn't think what to do, so I tried turning around.  I rotated to the left, completely turned with ease.  So then I thought I would try turning around to the right, as I did so, I noticed something in the corner of my eye, some shadow.  I looked at it and there appeared to be 2 or 3 corners to my eye, like double, triple vision.  Then I started to feel incredibly tired as the shadows started to close up my vision, I completely lost consciousness for a second before waking up as normal.  Anybody explain this?  Why couldn't I leave my body but I could rotate within it?  Did I already have a projection going at the time?  And was some entity taking my energy during the process of the kiss?  Has this happened to anybody else?  Why did I black out before I could wake up?

Hi Tia! I believe Robert says in one of his articles that there are some energy exchange ports on the lips and tongue, so it's quite possible that this creature was feeding off your energy, but hey, who can blame someone if they're hungry? I've never been out, but from reading on this forum for 6 months now, I believe that's a pretty likely explanation for your experience.

Keep posting,

I have the same kind of disorienting dreams too. that awkward vision
<br>
trying to focus while you seem to be caught in this battle not to faint.
<br>
Almost like being drunk and this happens while something important
<br>
is going on in the dream, and you fight to stay in control. It's very
<br>
frustrating.
<br>
<br>
to me it seems as though while dreaming, I having an unconscious OBE
<br>
at the same time. And I'm splitting myself between the two, wanting to
<br>
stay with the dream but feeling what my astral is doing. thus affecting
<br>
the dream, when I move more towards the OBE I lose my vision and
<br>
control of the dream, which is when I get the drunk sensation and the
<br>
lopsided vision.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if this can shed some light,  but you're not alone.

Tia: I read your post a few times over the past couple of days, and I think all you had was a weird dream. Given the nature of what we are involved with, there is a tendency to try and see some kind of meaning in all our dreams. But sometimes a weird dream is just that.

And sometimes a kiss is just a kiss.
