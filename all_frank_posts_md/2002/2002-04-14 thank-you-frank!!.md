I don't post much, lurk mostly, but I'm extremely excited with what I'm able to do lately and had to share it with someone.
<br>
<br>
I can now prject at will!
<br>
<br>
I've been able to do this lately with the help of Frank's advice and approach.
<br>
What's funny is that I've been able to do this only after I stopped TRYING to project!
<br>
<br>
Let me start at the beginning:
<br>
At the moment I'm dependent on the sleep state, only because it is there that I can achieve the necessary state of relaxation and trance.
<br>
<br>
when I begin to wake in and out of sleep I try to remain absolutely still to try and lose the sense of my body, another words, I can't feel the edges of my body. I feel like I'm floating in space. I found that I can expand or shrink my sense of I, or feel out to my body if I like.
<br>
<br>
This i find is extremely important! Once you get this everything else is easy.
<br>
<br>
I have followed the Buddhist path for many years now, and one of the tenets of Buddhism is that we are not this body. This is a profound experience for me because now I have experienced it directly. It's one thing to know something, and something entirely different to experience it directly.
<br>
<br>
Now Frank recommends that we should move are consciousness from behind our eyes to the brow chakra, but I find that what is important really is to move it away from behind the eyes. Where, I don't think it matters.
<br>
I've projected from my solar plexus and other points of my body.
<br>
<br>
The best piece of advice from Frank is, 'projection is like physically handling a new-born baby'. It's a subtle process.
<br>
<br>
I used to, like many of you probably do, grit my teeth and squench my eyes and think to myself, 'now I'm gonna project'.
<br>
<br>
The mind is a giant watchdog and not so easily fooled.
<br>
<br>
You need to enter through the back door, window, hell, go through the doggy door if you have to, just don't let it know you are trying to project.
<br>
<br>
Back to my method:
<br>
Once I lose the sense of my body, I gently roll my eyes back and wait for the dream images to appear. Now this is a technique I've used as a kid. I'm sure I can simplify the process so I'm not dependent on this.
<br>
I'm not emersed in them as in a dream, but they appear as if on a screen. The rest is simple, I walk towards them, the vibrations begin, then the bodies began to seperate. I used to try and project in to the images, but my mind said, 'not gonna happen'!.
<br>
<br>
I've had 7 projections out of 10 attempts now, and feel confident with the method.
<br>
<br>
The main thing:
<br>
<br>
1.Explore the trance state, become familiar with it.
<br>
2.Do not try to hard.
<br>
3.Trick the mind because it will resist.
<br>
<br>
Frank is absolutely right about the "Training ground". That's were I have been lately, It's amazing how thoughts will transform the enviroment.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I hope this will help you guys in some way.

Oh, one other thing, i project on my side. I tried for years now on my back because I thought that was the only way, but when I sleep, that's the position I'm in when I wake.
<br>
<br>
Go figure.

Thanks a bunch, this is great advice. Also, the only time I poked my head and shoulders out of my body, I was on my side. I think any position that allows you to achieve the proper state of mind will work.

I'm getting confused. This is the very first time I ever spoke to people on this topic in my 20-odd years of obe experiences.
<br>
<br>
As such, I know the "solution" will only become when all of us begin helping each other.
<br>
<br>
I'm just a tiny fish swimming in such a huge ocean... and I do very much thank-you for your support.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
