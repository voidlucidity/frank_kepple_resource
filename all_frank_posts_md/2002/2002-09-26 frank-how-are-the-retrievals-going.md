Hi Frank,
<br>
How are your retrievals with Harath going?  Have you done anymore with him, lately?  It's always interestingly good reading to hear about your adventures and gets you wondering about the Astral even more.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
<br>

They're not, I'm afraid. I'm on a bit of an Astral projection downer at the moment. Last one was about 10 days ago.

Lately, I've been practising developing my navigation skills and have been trying to project to Focus 27. I want to go to what the Monroe school calls TMI-There, and see if it's all true what they say, about the crystal and everything. And I was rather hoping I might be able to contact Bob Monroe and have a chat, as I've got a number of questions for him. I've had no success so far.
<br>
<br>
As for Harath, he's around somewhere, I know that much as I often sense his light in the distance. But these guides can be mighty frustrating to deal with at times. Everytime he takes a step back I know there's a lesson I need to discover somewhere. Problem is, sometimes they won't just simply come out and tell you what you need to do, or just simply guide you to where it is you need to go.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
