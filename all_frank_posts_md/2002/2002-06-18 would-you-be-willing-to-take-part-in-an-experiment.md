<section>
Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me here.  I am a member of another online community called the shroomery.  Recently a thread came up about Astral Projection.  If you want you can take a look:

</a>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, one of the members has said that he would be willing to set up an experiment which gives you the opportunity to prove that this ability exists once and for all!  What's more there will be $1000 up for grabs if you succeed, but of course you can always donate the money to charity if you want.  All you would have to do is astral project to this person's house and identify a mystey object.  This person is pretty much open minded to the possibilty that AP exists, but is the type of person who needs hard evidence to back his beliefs.  I would think that the more experienced among you would jump at the chance to prove this ability, given that the findings would be very important for the evolution of human consciousness.  Reply here or at the above thread if you are interested.  Thanks.

Interesting! That sounds like a good deal. Usually for us to project to a person,or his place, we have to personally know him well.  What is he planning to do, give us an address? It's not as easy as it seems, but maybe the elders will try.

Not surprisingly you have little idea of how pojecting works. That's not an insult - I urge you to try it and experience for yourself what it's like, but to do something like go to someones house and identify a mystery object is difficuilt for many reasons.
<br>
<br>
It has been attempted to be proven in lab experiments where a number is placed above the person on the wall and out of eye-reach. The person then projects into the room and tries to read the number. It has not been proven this method as of yet, however one subject did report seeing another person in the corridor (which was out of eye-shot and ear-shot). This person was infact the wife of one of the overseers who came to say hi to her husband.
<br>
<br>
You might also want to look at the thread several pages back on this forum (OBE discussions) titled something like "Proof of OBE and/or how to win $1million dollars". You can read comments from people who would be able to prove projection and see why they wouldn't do it.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I strongly urge you to look into AP if it interests you. It is fascinating and stretches your mind. As you come from a drugs related website  you might be able to relate to this: I got interested in OBEs from a dex trip when I left my body. I read the dex FAQ and learnt that people can actually do this at will - without relying on drugs. Expand your mind

Word is "The Amazing Randy" is being taken on to the tune of 1.2 million USD.
<br>
<br>
The bet is they have to beat odds of 1,000,000:1. Randy is taking it real seriously and has hired some university statistics professors. Or so I am told.
