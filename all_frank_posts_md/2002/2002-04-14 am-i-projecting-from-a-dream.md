Hello,
<br>
lately I've been having a certain experience within dreams.  In the dream, I am laying on my bed, or some other surface, and all of a sudden my body begins to vibrate softly, and tingle.  It seems I am lucid at this point, and I have this instinct to let it happen rather than fight it.  I let myself buz and vibrate, and I eventually float into the air and turn as if I were in a rotating oven.  It stops, and I am still on the bed or surface.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what to make of this.

Seems to me like you are on the verge of projection. Concentrate on letting the vibrations build in intensity then... take off!

Well, I think the floating up into the air and rotating could be me projecting?  Last night, after i stopped rotating, I flew around my house (whether this was in a dream or obe, i don't know).  I'm not sure that this was a real time OBE because i saw my sister in the kitchen, and it was day.... in physical time it was late at night.  Also, everything seemed hazy and fake--things almost had a transparent appearance to them.
<br>
<br>
In reference to your response, Frank, I do let it go, but it just stops and i feel like i'm still in the dream.  Really weird.  Anyway, thanks.

I've had almost the exact same experience very recently. If it were an actual OBE, you'd know for sure that it was.
<br>
<br>
However, according to someone who replied to one of my posts, this is a benchmark of progress. You're progressively opening your third eye and building up your energy.
<br>
<br>
Feel free to read my posts in the "Experiences" section. I've had a few of these kinds of experiences lately.
