Hey everyone - - -
<br>
<br>
Sorry I've been away!  I've been ill and up to my eyeballs in home renovation projects.  But I'm home on sick leave right now and thought I'd check in.  It is good to see the usual suspects!  I've missed you.

hey welcome back tisha.  great news about the forum.  every single member has learned how to project and we've all been having astral meetings at night.  it seems that all we had to do was say "it would be super duper cool if i could project tonight", and before we were done the sentence we were whooshed away to heaven.  see ya soon.

Hey tisha....I don't know you...but welcome back.
<br>
<br>
If you read this sentence backwords it would make more sense than it does.  Now don't read this over and over and over....because you might just do it.

Hi - - everything is going to be ok - - - had major water/mold problems in my house, and since my breathing stopped twice from it I though it best to refinance my house and start some major repairs.
<br>
<br>
So right now I'm missing a ceiling and carpet in one room, but the green, soggy insulation is gone, the leaky bathtub is fixed, and the house smells much better.  There is too much mold/dust kicking around for me to feel better yet (I have asthma), but I will be fine eventually.
<br>
<br>
Sooo, when I feel better, I'm going back to spackling and painting.  God willing, by the New Year I'll be done.
<br>
<br>
good to be back,
<br>
