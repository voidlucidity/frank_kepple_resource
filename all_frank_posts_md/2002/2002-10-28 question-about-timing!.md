<section>
I am just going to open a topic about what people think is the best length of time to be relaxing, clearing mind etc before you get into trance or hypnogogic state?
<br>
<br>
I only ask because i normally give it 30 mins then give up!
<br>
<br>
Any ideas?

I'm not really sure how to answer this, because for me, I don't really TRY to get into a trance state.  I more or less allow it to happen.
<br>
<br>
For example, when I lay down, I usually do some rythmic breathing exercises for at least 5 minutes.  After that, my body kind of takes over the process, and I simply detach myself mentally from my surroundings, and watch for any hypnogogic or astral scenery.
<br>
<br>
But if I were a big practitioner of deep trance states, I probably wouldn't go too much over 30 minutes.  I think it depends on the person.  Some people can't even go to sleep unless they lay there for an hour or more, let alone try to get into an altered state of consciousness.  Since I'm the kind of person that can fall asleep within 10 minutes of laying down, practing a trance-like state for more than 30 minutes seems really long for me.

I too let my body take over the process but before I see anything like astral scenery I have to lie there for at least 20 minutes. I'm one of thos that takes about and hour, sometimes an hour and a half before I eventually fall asleep, so I can quite happily lie there for anything up to 2 hours, maybe more.

<br>
With me, it has settled into a pattern where I can focus away from the Physical and enter the Astral after about 15 to 30 minutes. But I'm certain this time could be further reduced with more practice. It used to take me sometimes 2 to 2.5 hours of repeated attempts and 50% of the time I'd get virtually nowhere.
<br>
<br>
Which was all darned frustrating because, during the same time, I could easily wake-up in a Lucid Dream and project from there. Often I'd project from a Lucid Dream, have a roam around the Astral, then return to Physical; at which point I'd try and project again, only in a conscious-exit fashion, and I'd get nowhere.
<br>
<br>
The big breakthrough came with me when I decided to change my way of thinking as regards my physical body. I used to think of the physical-body's awake-state as being a barrier to projection success: but later discovered it was precisely
<i>
 because
</i>
I thought this way that was scuppering my projection attempts.
<br>
<br>
What I decided was to just simply ignore my physical body entirely. Which was tricky to do, at first. Now, if it wants to move on its side, say, I just let it move. Whereas, before, I'd sense the urge to move as something that would scupper the whole thing, something that had to be shut out at all costs. But now, as I say, I just ignore my physical-body and just let it get on with whatever it needs to get on with.
<br>
<br>
Instead, I now solely think in terms of achieving the correct mind-state, rather than first trying to achieve the correct body state. I found if you just switch-off from the physical and concentrate on what is going-on mentally, the physical body quickly fades into the background
<i>
 once you achieve the correct mental state
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
The correct mental state is not easy to describe. And the difficulty is,
<u>
 with conscious-exit projection
</u>
, you will still have a strong awareness of your physical-body at the stage whilst trying to achieve the correct mental state. Which can be most off-putting, but you've just got to teach yourself to ignore it.
<br>
<br>
Achieving the correct mental state, primarily involves turning your focal point of awareness through 180degs and focusing inwards: to the place in your mind where your higher imagination resides. Fortunately, you can find the place easily by imagining your favourite food, or thinking of being at a favourite holiday destination, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Wherever you sense the feeling of whatever it is you are imagining, in your mind, that's where you need to focus towards (to the exclusion of all other day-to-day concerns) because, down that path, is your connection to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Like, if you plug in a TV you connect the plug to a wall socket. The wall socket is the TV's connection to the mains-supply. Well, your focal point of mental awareness is the plug, and the wall socket is situated at the upper reaches of your higher imagination.
<br>

so what your saying is that to achieve trance it doesnt matter what you concentrate on as long as its something.
<br>
Sounds good to me thanks

I usually don't have a problem falling asleep Usually I know I'm worn out when I go to bed.
<br>
If ever I don't fall asleep after 15 or 20 minutes, I get up for a few minutes then go back to bed. I usually fall asleep after that. I just look at what comes into my mind before I fall asleep. I'm usually too sleepy to get up to journal anything if anything interesting comes up.
<br>
I never could do the note pad and pencil at the bedside.
<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting little something to do. After you get to bed, imagine yourself going to bed again.
<br>
I had an inner voice (one and only time it happened to me) tell me to do this (came from the stomach area). I did and a memory of some family friends popped into my head. No visual, just thoughts of this family.
<br>
It turned out to be significant but I didn't know it at the time.
<br>
<br>
Maybe hearing or just random thoughts is what you should try. Not always is it a visual thing.
<br>
<br>
Maybe try different lighting, I sleep in a half dark room with only indirect lighting coming into the room. On bright moon nights, I just use that added lighting.
<br>
<br>
Maybe even re-arrange your bedroom a bit.The change can be a trigger.

For me, I basically do the same as Jeff and Marty except  I have  to really, really relax the body and quiet the mind.  If I am having a hard time quieting the mind, I end up  just hanging out  in my own consciousness with my mind still going on and on.
<br>
<br>
I haven't timed  how long it takes  for me  to get all the way to hypnotic imagery but  it takes approximatly 30 to 40 minutes to reach the astral.
<br>
<br>
Keep trying,  your doing great!
