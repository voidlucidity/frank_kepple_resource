This is the second time I came across this same little girl.Last time we met I kind of bugged out because there was some shooting and argueing going on in the background.These people started chasing me with guns,quickly went through the nearest wall.
<br>
<br>
Bullets were flying everywhere.Behind this wall was like a mile of all kinds of piping.I crawled around for a while trying to find a way out.But I came back to my body before I made it.
<br>
<br>
I didnt know what to make of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///that.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 that.So
</a>
I just shrugged it off.But I really got a good look at this girl that was standing around.She was calling out for her mother.This happened like 4 months ago.
<br>
<br>
Last night I became lucid and I was in this  room.There was like a ghostly white dog up next to me.
<br>
<br>
I did not have much control over what I was doing.But I was very concious of what was going on.I started to play around with the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///dog.like" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 dog.Like
</a>
sticking my hand in the mouth and it was playfully chewing on it.
<br>
<br>
Than I felt like a click,and I recalled something I read on a thread at Bruce Moens site."Thoughtforms vs entities how do you tell"And I started  to feel love.And the dog starts to dissolve and get all blurry.
<br>
<br>
After it all cleared up.There standing was this same little girl.Hard to forget her pin straight long blond
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///hair.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 hair.So
</a>
I started walking with her.We passed several people.They looked odd almost like night of the living dead but not quite as much gore.
<br>
<br>
All this information started coming to me.Its like all of a sudden I just knew this was her family.And I look over to one of them and I felt it was the father.He did a very horrible thing.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well that same thing was happening over again.I was in some nonverbal communication with the girl.And I tried to ask for her name.She said she didnt know?And I wanted her to come with me,But she didnt seem to be willing.
<br>
<br>
She started freezing up in like  rigomorits.What I was getting was that the dad poisened all of them,including himself.I told her in like a telepathic,empathic way about love.And anytime anybody tried to hurt her to use it.
<br>
<br>
This is very hard for me to explain and comprehend the whole experience.II kind of feel like I let her down.And part of me doesnt know if it was real or not.This is my 2nd

1st didnt have this much info about the victims.
<br>
<br>
All I did was bring up 2 kids from underneath the sea.They were in a sunken ship.Its going to take a while for me to be really sure about all this.I know how powerful the mind is and I dont want to be played like a violin..

Alpha: From my limited experience it very much sounds like a retrieval situation. Ginny is our resident expert on this subject and I wonder what she might have to say.
<br>
<br>
The bullets flying, I recognise as I've come across loads of people in the belief-system regions still playing the various war-games they played while Physical. In fact, the last retrieval I did was a "cop shoot out" situation where this American policeman got shot alongside his two sons near his home.
<br>
<br>
He didn't realise he had died and was still tending to what he thought were his dying offspring barely clinging on to life - while yelling into his radio for backup. Me and my regular guide, Harath, turned up in this big 1960's or maybe early 70's style cop-car of the like you see on some of the old Kojak episodes.
<br>
<br>
The bullets were really flying on this one (which I suppose made a change from the huge knife I got stabbed with the previous time). And just as we arrived there was this really loud explosion... and... I ducked. The look on Harath's face as he turned and looked at me I'll never forget. Anyway, we got them bundled into this car and off we went to a recovery area within F27 which had been specially prepared.
<br>
<br>
Also, where you say that all the info just started coming to you? Yes, that I do very much recognise. It comes across like you just wonder and then it seems like the moment you wonder, the answer comes to mind. But as to why the child was reluctant, I'm sure Ginny could help you there.

Hi Alpha,
<br>
<br>
Yes, it sounds as if you're being presented with a retrieval situation.
<br>
<br>
The feeling I get about the little girl's inability to tell you her name or leave with you is she's in a state of shock...and perhaps this shock is making her feel completely insecure about everything in that environment she's in.
<br>
<br>
Several things come to mind in being able to help her, but first...I take it you go OOB as well as experience lucid dreaming? Can you go back to her at will? I've experienced OOBEs and lucid dreams many times, but in the last two years have preferred Phasing, or as Bruce Moen teaches, Focusing Attention away from the physical, while in an awake and conscious state of mind,  and using Intent (just mentally stating a desire) to go where I want to go, be with whomever, etc. If you can do this, or if you want to go OOB or see what happens while asleep, you can always place the *intent* ahead of time to visit with her.
<br>
<br>
It's been my experience in two years of retrieving that quite often children are very reluctant to leave with a retirever, a 'stranger'. They may have been taught to never trust strangers and so on.  I'm not sure of all the details of her emotional situation and her environment There, but telling her about love was a good thing to do. And, share that feelling of love with her when you next visit with her. See/feel the love going to her. The energy/consciousness we call unconditional love opens perception...can momentarily lift people out of whatever fears/emotions may be blocking their ability to move on, see things more clearly etc.
<br>
Also, children love the idea of flying. I few times, when a child was reluctant to leave, I asked if they liked to go flying. I even showed one young boy how I could move up and down and he decided he wanted to fly around with me too, and I was able to take him to the Reception Center at Focus 27.  Or you can ask for or just 'see' a magic carpet materilaize nearby, asking if they'd like to take a fun ride.
<br>
When I go on retrievals I always go with a Helper (Helpers are people in the afterlife who've been physically alive humans at one time but who've simply chosen to stay in the nonphysical to help folks There. They always come from a place of love. They can never impose their will on another. And they're always available if we need them , epsecially in retrieval situations)....or once in a retrieval situation I may ask for a Helper or a loving Guide to come and help out. Helpers are very creative in knowing and doing whatever it takes to help a stuck person, such as your little girl.  The only reason Helpers haven't been able to help this girl out so far is because of *her beliefs*---and hers are really fear-based.
<br>
The child most likely *thinks/believes* she's still alive and so she simply isn't aware of *nonphysical people* trying to help her. She only recognizes those who are physical alive (retrievers) because she still thinks she is. All a retriever has to do is to , #1--befriend the stuck person (such as what you've already done...so now she'll possibly remember you and trust you more when you go back), #2--get a feel for their situation and why they're stuck (which you've already done--and in her case you may want to find out if her grandparents are deceased..would she be motivated to leave her environment to go and see them?)  #3-- just help them to *become aware* of Helpers (because once they do become aware of them  they're in very good hands), and/or you can at that point suggest to her flying, or would she like to go for a piggyback ride:  whatever you feel while There, may work.
<br>
I think you were doing a fantastic job in being open to information coming to you. You just 'knew' about her family and what her father had done. This always happens in retrievals, for me. It's been my experience that it's usually Helpers, even loving deceased family members, who give us this info,  just so the stuck person can become aware of them with the aide of a retriever.
<br>
<br>
Alpha, I hope I've explained this okay...and I hope you get back to her.
<br>
<br>
Much love,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

<br>
Ginny: thank you for the detailed response and you bring up an important point which I overlooked, which is, of having a "helper" by your side. I'm so used now to Harath always being with me, and that's what I think you need to become open to, Alpha. I'm sure there will be helpers around you at the time and all it should take is to become open to that possibility which should bring them within the range of your perception (on the Astral your willingness to believe largely determines your ability to perceive).
<br>
<br>
What Harath has taught me to do is latch onto a feeling which he described as a "spark of hope" that exists within a child's mind seemingly regardless of the horrific circumstances they are in. It's next to impossible for me to explain in words but there is a kind of resonant vibration I feel that's just a slight phase shift away from the dingy and dark circumstances you often come across within the lower regions.
<br>
<br>
It's like rather than concentrating on the surrounding circumstances, what I do is concentrate on the child being retrieved. Then I think of a kind of Christmas morning feeling. It's like on the Physical when a child suddenly finds themselves surrounded by all kinds of good things it overwhelms their awareness to the point where they forget everything going on around them. They just have this wide-eyed wonderous look and their aura sparkles. Like, for example, when you see children meeting their favourite cartoon characters in Disneyland.
<br>
<br>
Well, it's that kind of feeling that I search to bring out (apologies if my explanation is of no use but it's difficult for me to describe in words). The essential thing to bear in mind is to avoid concentrating on the actual circumstances. I mean, to the point where you start to get involved.
<br>
<br>
There was a post not so long ago that typified the kinds of entanglements that can trap you. This person found themselves within one of the lower regions and several men grabbed her and were about to put her in a big cooking pot or something. So she started screaming and struggling, calling out for her friend, who I think was an experienced projector. Her friend saved her from the circumstances. But she could so very easily have saved herself simply by cracking a joke or two, which would have raised her vibration.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, best of luck Alpha. It's good to hear of your progress.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That gives me an idea she may be looking for me.Or either that maybe I already got her and didnt remember the experience,previous night I could not recall anything at all.That is strange I usually have a dream or 2.Yes Ginny that is how I go oobe usually through lucid dreams.But there are times where I seem to  skip the lucid dream  and am able to slip out

<br>
<br>
Heres the situation with my helpers.Ive met 2 possible ones.But have never seen them again.When I am in meditation,usually this happens before bed. I hear what very well could be them.Its almost always an explanation about something,unfortunetely I usually forget most of it.There have been quite a few projections where I was accompanied by someone.But Im a loner by nature.Hardly ever speak unless spoken too.When I get out its like I am a kid  who found a new patch of  woods to explore.Sooner or lator I lose track of that person/spirit.
<br>
<br>
Ive tried to place my intent with meeting them again.But nothing yet.Maybe I need to put a little more into it.We'll see Ive been pretty patient with them.Even though  there have been times when I really could of used there advice.Maybe me writing this right now will send a stronger message to them.

 Alpha,
 <br>
 <br>
 Just something that popped into my head after reading your post, so thought I'd run this by you.
 <br>
 <br>
 Sometimes people have difficulty with *placing intent*, whether it be while consciously exploring There, going OOB, being lucid in the dream state, etc.  Some feel they have to drum up great emotion when they state a desire in order for the desired intent  to be communicated (I use to do this and I've often wondered what Helpers and Guides thought of my mental shouting---LOL!). Others worry any doubting cancels out the stated desire and so on. Something else Bruce Moen teaches is a theory he discovered by memory researcher Charles Tart: State-Specific Memory. Let me quote here:
 <br>
 <br>
 Tart claims, " ' The memory of an event is stored in the area of consciousness in which the event occurred.' A simple example most of us are familiar with is trying to remember a dream. As we first begin to wake up, when most of our consciousness is still focused in 'dreamland', the dream can be pretty clear. But the more we wake up, i.e., shift our consciousness from dreamland to physical reality, the more our memory of the dream fades away. Often, once we are fully awake, for most of us, memory of the dream is gone. But, acording to the theory of state-specific memory,  memory of the dream still exists, and that memory is stored in the area of consciousness in which the dream occurred, dreamland. So in theory, if one could find a way to shift one's awareness back to dreamland, full memory of the dream would be more easily accessible."
 <br>
 Bruce goes on to say, "I eventually discovered (at TMI) that each of the focus levels (in the afterlife) had a particular feeling. I discovered that if I remembered the *feeling* of, say, Focus 10, my awareness would automatically shift to that area of consciousness."
 <br>
 <br>
 I've worked with this technique, Alpha, and it works. I'm still kinda rusty with it at times but only because I may now and then doubt it's ability to work for me (beliefs!---lol). For instance, when I've been on a long afterlife joureny or one in which a lot happens, when back in full consciousness I will only have partial memory of what happened....but when I relax or just sit at the keyboard and simply recall or bring up the *feeling* of the afterlife place I was in, memories just start flooding my brain. Also, I've been able to just automatically return to an afterlife place by remembering the feel it had when I last visited There.
 <br>
 <br>
 Hope this helps. Am still working with it but find this idea of recalling the feel of any area of consciousness to remember or literally revisit, really fascinating.
 <br>
 Much love,
 <br>
 <br>
 Ginny

Helen, I am sorry you feel as you do. I put my feelings towards your various posts in a private message. As yet I have received no response. Often, in situations such as these, no reply is the answer. I said in my message that I humbly apologise for having offended you. Causing people upset on the scale you demonstrated it not what I am about.
