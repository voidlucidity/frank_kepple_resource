Hi!
<br>
<br>
My recent (and ongoing)  'journey within' isn't giving me many answers!
<br>
<br>
probably because I am actually getting pulled into daily events, my energy has been focused on family and kids moreso than internal stuff.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I browsed and enjoyed many of the recent threads - Think I'll visit tomorrow and actually chime into a few conversations.
<br>
<br>
I missed you folks!
<br>
<br>
Patty

Hi!
<br>
<br>
Nice to hear from you.
<br>
Don't push the journey too hard, things like them tend to have a mind of their own and prgress comes when you least expect it.
