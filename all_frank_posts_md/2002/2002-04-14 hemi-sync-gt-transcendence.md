<section>
Hello everyone!
<br>
<br>
I just got done faxing an order over to the Monroe Institute for a the single CD "Transcendence" which I purchased from the catalog list at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.hemi-sync.com/catalog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.hemi-sync.com/catalog
</a>
.  I would have loved to been able to purchase the first set of the Gateway program, but as of now I am too strapped for cash to make that kind of purchase (I'm young, in school and about to get married so I have to make my money go a long way these days...I am sure many of you understand!)
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my question is for those of you who have experience with Gateway of Hemi-sync in general.  What have your experiences been like?  I am not expecting Hemi-sync to do anything grandiose or even specific for me, ie. cause spontaneous OBE, etc.  Of course I am interested in "expanding my consciousness" and in OBE (who in here isn't!!!)  More than anything, however, I am interested to know if there is anything in specific that can aid in the process of the synchronization of the two halfs of the brain and also specific "tips" that could help to move deeper into trance and even ways to step out of the body which are specific to the hemi-sync, etc.
<br>
<br>
A penny for your thoughts anyone...
<br>
<br>
By the way the CD "Transcendence" I ordered is described as followed on the website:
<br>
<br>
"Transcendence" #TP024CN CD(Verbal) Price: $19.95 + S&amp;H Qty
<br>
<br>
Move beyond your thoughts and daily concerns as you listen to the deeply relaxing Hemi-Sync sound patterns of Transcendence. The verbal guidance and Hemi-Sync signals incorporated on Track/Side 1 will lead you in the exploration of expanded states of consciousness. Create your own experiences with Track/Side 2, an extended free-flow
<br>
exploration without verbal guidance. Transcendence will leave you centered, focused, and totally refreshed. (Mind Food - Track/Side 1-Verbal; Track/Side 2-Non-Verbal)
<br>
<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't have a clue what Hemi-Sync is, the following is some info I copied and pasted from
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/www.http://www.monroeinstitute.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.http://www.monroeinstitute.org
</a>
for you to get a jist of what this technology is all about:
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hemi-Sync® Process
<br>
<br>
The trademarked term Hemi-Sync signifies a patented combination of multiplexed audio binaural beats
<br>
and pink sound (or music) designed to alter arousal levels. Hemi-Sync sounds are combined with
<br>
verbal suggestion, relaxation exercises, and guided imagery, all carefully crafted to engender desired
<br>
experiences in focused states of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Masking Hemi-Sync's Binaural Beats
<br>
<br>
Other than the obvious concept of masking out unwanted or disturbing noises, mixing pink sound (filtered white noise) with
<br>
Hemi-Sync's binaural beats provides a specific sensory integration congruent with nonphysical experiences.
<br>
<br>
Touch, movement, body awareness, sight, sound, and the pull of gravity all combine to form a composite picture
<br>
of who we are, where we are, and what is happening around us. The automatic, unconscious organization and
<br>
interpretation of this information is called a sensory integration. Discrete integrations characterize our conscious
<br>
experiences and are memory-linked to those experiences. The greater the coherence between a past integration
<br>
and a present activity, the greater the degree of conscious awareness of that activity. In fact, if an activity cannot
<br>
be linked with a previous sensory integration, it may remain an unconscious experience.
<br>
<br>
During the experience of focused states of consciousness, some of which may not involve the physical senses, the
<br>
composite picture of who we are, where we are, and what is going on around us can be extraordinary. Some
<br>
focused-state experiences are linked to distinctive integrations involving deep physical relaxation, varied degrees
<br>
of sensory isolation, and internally generated stimuli. Unfamiliarity with such unique integrations may lead to a
<br>
feeling of having experienced nothing.
<br>
<br>
While researching the out-of-body experience, Bob Monroe (and others) noticed a roaring or hissing during the
<br>
initial and final moments of the out-of-body experience. Therefore, when Bob Monroe first developed Hemi-Sync
<br>
he was inspired to use pink sound to simulate the visceral environment of the out-of-body experience. By doing
<br>
so, he provided a sensory integration link with the experience of the out-of-body state as he knew it.
<br>
<br>
When you first start listening to Hemi-Sync, you consciously hear the binaural beating. This provides a comfortable
<br>
psychological assurance that all is well. This belief sets the stage for further experiences.
<br>
<br>
In 1973, Scientific American published research conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine by Gerald
<br>
Oster demonstrating that masking noise does not obscure the perception of binaural beats. This perception of
<br>
binaural beats occurs, explains L. A. Jeffress and his colleagues at the University of Texas, because at any instant
<br>
the amplitude of the background noise will be more likely to be reinforced if the amplitudes of the signals are in
<br>
coincidence. Conversely, when the amplitudes of the signals are in opposition, destructive interference is more
<br>
likely. The background noise should be just loud enough to obscure the tones producing the binaural beats.
<br>
<br>
After listening to Hemi-Sync for several minutes, your conscious perception of the rhythmic beating fades. This natural tendancy
<br>
supports the state-changing effectiveness of the Hemi-Sync process.
<br>
<br>
The pink sound used in the Hemi-Sync process provides a ganzfeld (a word meaning "homogenized field")
<br>
environment ideal for consciousness exploration. Ganzfeld research shows that subjects experience consciousness
<br>
shifts when exposed to a ganzfeld stimulus. After a period of time the brain's reticular activating system (RAS)
<br>
determines that the never-changing stimulus contains no information of value and the ganzfeld itself becomes
<br>
perceptually nonexistent within the conscious experience. This is called habituation. The mind turns its attention
<br>
elsewhere in search of meaningful stimuli.
<br>
<br>
Raw binaural beats (without pink-sound masking) may not habituate readily and can be irritating after a while. When properly
<br>
mixed with pink sound though, they quickly become part of the featureless ganzfeld environment and more effective at changing
<br>
arousal levels (brainwave states). The conscious mind is freed from the ever-changing stimuli of the physical world. The reticular
<br>
activating system attends to the specially designed Hemi-Sync binaural beats, stimulating brainwave states ascendant to focused
<br>
states of consciousness. Given appropriate social-psychological conditioning, sufficient mental acuity, and a clear intent,
<br>
awareness opens to realms beyond physical reality.
<br>
<br>
Hemi-Sync . . . stereo earphones or speakers?
<br>
<br>
When earphones are used, the listener experiences binaural beating. The sensation of auditory binaural beats occurs when two
<br>
coherent sounds of nearly similar frequencies are presented one to each ear. The brain integrates the two signals, producing a
<br>
sensation of a third sound called the binaural beat. Binaural beats originate in the brainstem's superior olivary nucleus, the site of
<br>
contralateral integration of auditory input. This auditory sensation is neurologically conveyed to the reticular formation and
<br>
simultaneously volume conducted to the cortex where it can be objectively measured as a frequency-following response using
<br>
EEG evoked-potential protocols.
<br>
<br>
When speakers are used the listener experiences very little binaural beating. The primary beat stimulus becomes monaural
<br>
beating, the sounds from the two speakers being mixed together in the open air before being perceived by the listener.
<br>
Monaural beating also produces a frequency-following response observable at the cortex. Evoked-potential research
<br>
conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine on both binaural and monaural beating shows that they are processed
<br>
differently in the brain.
<br>
<br>
Unlike monaural beating with speakers, listening to binaural beats with stereo earphones produces the illusion that the sounds
<br>
are located somewhere within the head. When binaural beats are very low frequency, less that 3 Hz, they seem to move back
<br>
and forth in the head. If the intensities of the right-ear and left-ear tones are different, an apparent elliptical orbit of the beating
<br>
develops.
<br>
<br>
Both monaural and binaural beats produce a measurable EEG frequency-following response. The amplitude of the
<br>
frequency-following response to monaural beats is higher however. How this fact alone impacts on the effectiveness of one
<br>
stimuli over the other in altering consciousness remains unknown. Here are some other differences:
<br>
<br>
Binaural beats can be perceived only when the right-ear and left-ear tones used to produce them are of low pitch, usually
<br>
less than 1500 Hz.
<br>
<br>
Monaural beats produced with two tones of equal intensity sound clean and pure.
<br>
<br>
Binaural beats have a muffled sound; only a slight modulation of the relatively loud right-ear and left-ear carrier tones.
<br>
<br>
To produce perfect monaural beats the amplitudes of the two tones have to be identical.
<br>
<br>
Binaural beats maintain their intensity regardless of the relative amplitudes of the right-ear and left-ear tones even if one
<br>
ear is below threshold. (A hearing loss in one ear may not reduce the effectiveness of binaural beats.)
<br>
<br>
Masking monaural beats with noise eliminates the perception of beating and the measurable EEG frequency-following
<br>
response.
<br>
<br>
Masking binaural beats with pink sound does not decrease their effectiveness.
<br>
<br>
Note: Pink sound is mixed with Hemi-Sync's binaural beats to provide a sensory integration link with out-of-body experiences.
<br>
Research has shown that noise does not obsecure the initial perception of binaural beats and it provides a ganzfeld environment
<br>
conducive to altering states of consciousness.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Given current understanding, here are some guidelines on the use of stereo earphones verses speakers when listening to
<br>
Hemi-Sync:
<br>
<br>
1.Stereo headphones are probably better when pink sound is used to mask Hemi-Sync's binaural beats (as in many
<br>
Focus-level programs) because binaural beating is not obscured by pink sound (not the case with monaural beating
<br>
experienced with speaker use). Use of earphones promotes the ganzfeld effect of the pink sound and enhances chances
<br>
for experiencing altered states of consciousness and the out-of-body state. Stereo headphones also create an
<br>
encapsulated environment, lessening room and ambient noise which might interfere with the process. Additionally, the use
<br>
of stereo headphones to insure the effectiveness of binaural beating becomes critical when you consider that the term
<br>
"Hemi-Sync" was coined as a trademark because many of the states of consciousness available through this technology
<br>
have been identified as presenting unique hemispherically synchronized brainwave frequencies. Although synchronized
<br>
brainwaves have long been associated with meditative and hypnagogic states, the Hemi-Sync process may be unique in
<br>
its ability to induce and improve such states of consciousness. The reason for this is physiological. Each ear is
<br>
"hardwired" (so to speak) to both hemispheres of the brain. Each hemisphere has its own olivary nucleus
<br>
(sound-processing center) which receives signals from each ear. In keeping with this physiological structure, when a
<br>
binaural beat is present there are actually two electrochemical synaptic waves of equal amplitude and frequency
<br>
present, one in each hemisphere (not the case with monaural beating experienced with speaker use). This is, in and of
<br>
itself, hemispheric synchrony of synaptic activity. The RAS seems to mimic this as it adapts cortical activity to the
<br>
Hemi-Sync environment. When stereo headphones are used the unique binaural beats of the Hemi-Sync process appear
<br>
to contribute to the hemispheric synchronization evidenced in meditative, sleep, and hypnagogic states of consciousness.
<br>
2.Speakers are probably okay when music is used to mask Hemi-Sync's binaural beats as in meditation and
<br>
stress-reduction exercises, enhanced-learning programs, and Metamusic selections. These formats are all designed to
<br>
produce binaural beats when stereo headphones are used but when speakers are used, the listener will perceive
<br>
monaural beats mixed at some level (depending on room acoustics, the position of the speakers, and the relative location
<br>
of the listener) with binaural beats. Unlike pink sound, music will not diminish the monaural beating produced by the
<br>
speakers.
<br>
3.When speakers are used, positioning left and right of the listener rather than in front would emphasize binaural over
<br>
monaural beating because the amplitude of the left or right carrier signal is not relevant in the case of binaural beating.
<br>
Positioning speakers left and right in a classroom would provide binaural beating (and monaural beating) to all listeners
<br>
regardless of their individual location within the room. Monaural beating will be accentuated if stereo speakers are
<br>
positioned in front of listeners because all would hear at relatively equal volume levels from both speakers. Placing the
<br>
stereo speakers close together in front of a group would be fine.
<br>
4.Remember that masking with pink sound does not obscure binaural beating but weakens monaural beating. Also, a
<br>
pink-sound ganzfeld is beneficial to the development of altered-state experiences and the out-of-body state. So it is best
<br>
to use stereo earphones when pink-sound masking is used.

Well, I guess I should have done this previous to posting...but I went to the built in search engine and found a few other posts in regards to the Hemi-Sync tapes and found that others have had similar questions.
<br>
<br>
The concern about becoming dependent on the tapes concerns me.  I guess it would be safe to assume that as long as one keeps things in perspective and doesn't use them as a crutch or always depend on them while meditating, etc. then this souldn't become detrimental to progress....
<br>
<br>
I purchased the tapes because I am interested to see how Hemi-Sync will work for me.  Obviously we are all different and something like this is very subjective.  In Far Journeys Monroe himself admits that Hemi-Sync didn't really ever work for him, but obviously it did for others and he knew it did.  Various people offered explanations for this, but in the end Monroe never really knew why.  I would assume that he was beyond it...I mean the guy talks about how OBE even became "boring to him" for a small period of time (before he started to realize the true potential for it and started using his "total self" or "over soul" to direct him).  Monroe also wrote about how easy it became for him to leave his body and sometimes he would be annoyed as he got into bed, eager for some good sleep, only to find himself moving out of body spontaneously...I find that kind of funny.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would still be interested to hear what those of you who have used Hemi-Sync techonology both extensively and/or just a little, have to say about it.

 I just listened to their Java demo and, to me, it sounds like just a jumble of noise. Personally, I'd find it irritating listening to it whilst attempting to project. But that's just my opinion, of course.

G,day Daniel mate!
<br>
<br>
Good to see you took the step &amp; tried the waters,I don't think you
<br>
will be dissapointed.I was skeptical at first &amp; just like you got
<br>
a single tape to begin with to see if there was any validity to
<br>
what they were talking about.I was more than surprised,I had never
<br>
heard any music new age/meditation that had binaural beats like that.
<br>
It's fairly noticable &amp; at first you will think "hey whats that
<br>
weird noise" but you soon start to really get into it.
<br>
<br>
I heard people say "Oh I don't want to be dependant on some music to
<br>
get me there" well as far as my case goes thats not true.I use them at least a few times a week but not everytime,as my girlfriend beats
<br>
me to them most nights,so I get some day time
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///ones.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 ones.It
</a>
puts me into
<br>
a theta level trance state within a couple of minutes now.I use these
<br>
tapes in conjunction with other techniques ,but mainly Robert Bruces
<br>
at the moment,put the two together &amp; whammo! You will probably feel
<br>
more perceptive afterwards &amp; have a great experience.I havn't got
<br>
Transcendance as yet so you will have to tell us what it's like.
<br>
I,m in the process of replacing my gateway series with C-D's now &amp;
<br>
I am receiving Wave 1 on monday as I too havn't got the money to get
<br>
the whole 7 waves which cost $800 for us here in Australia,but in
<br>
the U.S it would be about $500.
<br>
<br>
I should have had faith that it would be good after my readings,but
<br>
I didn't want to get jipped if it didn't work,I feel it really gave
<br>
me a turbo boost in my astral activities.The days afterwards you are
<br>
buzzing psychically &amp; are quite peaceful generally.
<br>
So good luck &amp; give us an update.
<br>
<br>
Good luck on your journeys
<br>
<br>

Hello,
<br>
I was delighted to find that by filling out a questionnaire on The Monroe Institute website they sent me one of their tapes for free. They don't tell you ahead of time so it was like a nice surprise at the end. (This was several months ago -I hope they are still doing it)
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the tape is called Catnapper - 45 minutes of pure relaxation. I find it extremely relaxing and it puts me into a sleep state within a few minutes. It's a great intro to Hemi-sinc for anyone interested.

I have Wave 7 signed by Laurie Monroe, I got it as a present. The old
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///astraltravellers.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 astraltravellers.com
</a>
website was officially acknowledged by them as an Official Gateway outreach site and it was designed by me.
<br>
<br>
Wave 7 has 6 excersises on it. The most interesting one is cd 3. Free flow 21.
<br>
<br>
I use it on an almost daily basis just to relax and well to keep out the outside noises.
<br>
<br>
I can get into 21 easily and it is awesome. I wont say anymore since I'd like you to find yourself.
<br>
<br>
I also have opening the heart, and Going home tape series. The going home tape series I haven't tried yet but Opening the Heart works for me. You can let go of your pain, anxiety etc and fill them in with happy thoughts.
<br>
<br>
The Going Home tapes I will be doing them over the summer I think since I then have time for things. Too busy with school and all that.
<br>
<br>
There are some people who attended the gateway workshops at Monroe and Focus 15 is one of them I believe but I am not sure.
<br>
<br>
Other than taht there is a complete mailinglist for people who have experienced things using the tapes and you can sign up here:

Yeah... I am excited to try out the tapes, but this is more of a interest rather than a conscious effort to use something to acheive a state which I know how to acheive naturally.  I think there is something to be said for hemi-sync...and I also think it would unwise to become dependent on these things to acheive states of consciousness that, like most of us have said, can be reached through prayer/meditation/energy work, whatever you want to call it.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the feedback.  I will let you know how this particular CD works out.  I am interested to finally try hemi-sync for myself!

<section>
Daniel,
<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly Joe McMoneagle, a very accomplished remote viewer and author, uses the hemi-synch tapes.  He says it gets him through his pre RV preparation quicker, I believe.  It's been a while since I've read his book so my recall is sketchy.  Also, I think he married Robert Monroe's daughter.
<br>
<br>
I used to own the entire Gateway cassette tape set.  The binaural beat effect is quite valid.  As others have said, it just gets you to a state you can get yourself, but in less time.
<br>
<br>
I became impatient with the Gateway tapes and sold them.  Kinda wish I had them now that my interest in OBE has rekindled.  *sigh*

Wish this forum had been going when I first wanted to find out about them!  I just took the plunge a few years ago and bought Gateway Wave I and there are so many people asking about what they do that I shoved it on one of my web pages, so click here to read my experience with them:

 </a>
</b>
<br>
<br>
In short - they do allow you to consciously create the energy double easily and you don't need them once you get used to the process.  But most people need more than what's in the instructions to have an OBE.  Definitely worth the money for someone starting out.
<br>

Hello everyone.
<br>
<br>
I originally started out with the exercises from the spreadsheet which can be downloaded on this website.  I found this was good for relaxation but didn't really help with trying to have an astral projection. The only interesting thing that happens is that I see different colours filling the space in front of my while doing the stretching exercises.
<br>
<br>
I then discovered the Monroe institute's cds. I have so far got the first Discovery cd set and Transcendence. I especially liked the Discovery cd exercises which cover Focus 10, resonant tuning, resonant energy balloon and sleep exercises.  During the Focus 10 state I experience various vibrations and a feeling of bouncing up and down like on a seesaw.  There was one time when I got what might have been an astral projection, but I'm not too sure. I saw the room I was in, from a perspective near the ceiling, but everything seemed stretched out to about 10 times longer than usual. This only lasted about a second though.
<br>
<br>
I'm still trying these exercises and have ordered the second cd set.  Transcendence I found was good for relaxation but I didn't get as far with trying to have an astral projection with this than with the Discovery cds.
<br>
<br>
I have always experienced a very occasional astral projection, maybe about once a year, usually taking the form of floating around somewhere outside my house early in the morning.
<br>

G,day Brian
<br>
<br>
Yes the gateway series is the best that I have tried.The other tapes I have
<br>
in the catalog seem to have someone else doing the voice over as the
<br>
gateway sounds like Bob Monroe himself.Also the other tapes don't have
<br>
that "you should be hearing this sound through your right ear" thing at the
<br>
beginning of each wave.The gateway sounds almost 60,s &amp; Bobs voice
<br>
comes over like an old Nasa narrative,but it's way cool anyway!
<br>
<br>
Good journeys
<br>

I recieved the Transcendence CD yesterday and I used it last night, but I was so tired that I stopped after about thirty mins.  So far I have experienced a very relaxed state, but I need to spend more time with it.
<br>
<br>
I continue to study and practice NEW energy which I love.  I will keep you updated with my progress as I think it's interesting to see how everyone respinds subjectively to this technology...

I look forward to your progressing using Hemi-sync. I myself could post a thing when I have the time. Should be in a month or 2 I am in and between exams atm.

I have found that it seems to work much better if you do it in the morning. I never get very far either on the times I've tried it in the evening.
<br>
<br>
Over the weekend I tried the relaxation exercise from Robert Bruce's spreadsheet followed by Transcendence track 1.  I got a strong green colour during the relaxation, then humming noises, vibrations and bouncing up and down feelings during Transcendence.  Do you think I'm getting close to having a projection, and how do you recommend actually getting out of the body?
<br>
<br>
On the subject of UK distributors, the only one I found was

<br>
<br>
I tried the websites listed above but none of them led to anywhere you could buy Gateway disks.

<br>
That is the European source for hemi-sync.
<br>
<br>
On recommendation I'll get back at you on that after I finish my school test. It is tomorrow and after that I'll write something down.

Thanks, this Hemisync Europe is very much cheaper than d-labs for the Gateway cds.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
I promised earlier on to make a simple and decent tutorial/technique but unfortunately as I thought this over I can't seem to think of any.
<br>
<br>
I am sorry, I did not mean to make a false promise just that it is far more complicated than I had thought.
<br>
<br>
My apologies for this.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
<br>
