<section>
I was interesting in hearing about anyones voyages into the final frontier during OBE.
<br>
RB talks about travelling to other galaxies etc and observing the earth (and Moon from orbit).
<br>
<br>
What I want to know is in that case, has anyone tried looking for the lunar landing gear and other stuff that the astronauts left lying around up there?
<br>
<br>
Has anyone travelled to other planets and observed other beings? (aliens).
<br>
<br>
I have read in some accounts in the past of people having OBEs and traveling to other worlds and communicating with highly advanced telepathic aliens and the like.
<br>
The thing about this is I'm a bit sceptical.
<br>
I wonder whether we ever leave the sphere of Earth at all.
<br>
I think that as you travel to the limits of the earth you most likely slip into the astral and then you see what you want to see. So when RB or others describe actualy visiting other galaxies (Or even observing the Earth from orbit) perhaps they have slipped into the astral without realising.
<br>
<br>
I reckon that it is probably VERY hard for spirits to escape the magnetic pull of the earth (and its astral realms). and when we fly out of it we slip into the astral again.
<br>
<br>
The reason I think this might be the case is because if it is so easy to astrally travel to other worlds, shouldnt there be myriads of alien OBEers flying around contacting us? (assuming they exist, and I dont see why not).
<br>
What really makes me sceptical thougth is that some people who DO claim to travel to other planets have said that they have projected to Venus or Mars and met martians/Venusians etc ala George adamski, which has got to be a cartload of old horseshit!
<br>
<br>
For this reason, I think that the earth and its astral realms probably form quite an effective barrier to RT travel to other parts of space.
<br>
Maybe proper space ships are the only decent way out after all!
<br>
<br>
Whats everyone elses thought/experiences concerning this?

<br>
Who is to say that they have not contacted us? Or that they are here trying to help us to develop spiritually? The reason that aliens may not just pop up and say "hey how's it going" is because they know that we would probably see it wrong and think they are gods or something. So if they are doing anything they are probably trying to steer us to more spiritual enlightnment so we can better understand. If they exist. They are probably waiting for Bruce's books to hit #1 so the public can be more aware of what is going on when they do make contact.

I doubt that magnetic forces have any effect on the astral bodies. I could be wrong but I doubt it. People have never reported any kind of magnetism effecting them on Earth, so I do not think the Earth's field would effect them either. And when you fly off into space you are not escaping any astral realms. They are not centered around Earth as if rings or something. They are part of everything everwhere. Of coarse I could be wrong but this is what I have concluded.
<br>
<br>
You do bring up an interesting question though.

<section>
You bring up a good point.  All I know is that in one of my OBE's last year, I was hovering above the face of the moon for a minute or so, and it was just as real as it was for me to be OBE and walking around my bedroom.
<br>
<br>
Like FallenAngel said, I'm also a bit hesistant to think that the earth's magnetic field would keep us within it's orbit.  I am interested to hear what others have to say.  Good topic!

<section>
yep, its an interesting topic... I don't think magnetic fields should have any effect on astral bodies though, which after all appear to inhabit a dimension seperate from the physical plane. Even when it comes to projecting in your bedroom, just because you can see your surroundings, that doesn't make you necessarily a part of the physical world and therefore subject to its laws.
<br>
<br>
So, in theory, If you can keep your mind clear enough, you could project into space and see the real time zone just as is possible on earth. Projecting into a completely unknown place probably results in a few distortions though....i.e. you see things that your mind has made up.
<br>
<br>
I read a remote viewing book a while back ( i'll get the reference tomorrow) where the participants said they had travelled to other galaxies and met other races. It was all very vague though.
<br>
<br>
If these alien races do exist, they would try and keep themselves way out of the public eye.....they wouldn't want to be blown to bits by us savages ! If they do exist, would there be lots of astral travellers from other planets ?.....perhaps there are, not necessarily in the real time zone.
<br>
<br>
Jeff, if i could project , I'd join you in a bit of moon hovering, it sounds like a laugh !!

Something I forgot to add, maybe there are astral entities that hang around other planets but do not manifest on the physical. Would that make them aliens? Should they even be considered if they do not exist on the physical?

You might be right Tisha, but if you compare the current research into anti gravity being undertaken by boeing............. (see

going back to the original post i think i have had an exprience years ago that i recently figured out. i was sleeping outside in a meadow and woke to see an enormous craft hovering ovehead, like the star wars motherships. next instant the world flipped and i was looking at a distant tree. I think maybe i was seeing the craft with astral vision, but i don't think i was abducted or anything.

<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
I dont mean it that the astral realms are rings as such.
<br>
The astral realms are made up of the colective 'dream pool' of humanity and so exist around/within us on the earth.
<br>
I think it makes sense that a planetary population creates its own dream pool or 'astal realm' as we call it. So a planets astral realm is specific to that civilisation.
<br>
Therefor, Mars doesnt have any 'astral realm' as such because thee is no population to create such level..... however if it was colonised...
<br>
<br>
Just my idea....   So civilisations each have their own astal realms specific to their own worlds.
<br>
Of course this doesnt rule out level of existence up and above astral realm... RB describes some of these, but I DO think our astral world is inherrinlty linked to us here on earth, other races probably have their own, therefor we dont really mingle very much.
<br>
<br>
Back to the original point though, I accept that magnitism does not affect us astally as such and yes, maybe we can leave the Earth this way.
<br>
But I think that it probably is quite easy to slip into the astral as you try to leave Earth, and many people dont realise this, and come back with all kinds of fantastic stories.
<br>
<br>
Jeff, Your lunar obe sounds good though, try checking for the old landing grounds on the sea of tranquility next time... that would be great!

<section>
<br>
<br>
I have travelled into space many times. Problem is, travelling to somewhere specific, at high speed, is *extremely* difficult to do. Well, it is for me at any rate. At the moment I am working on travelling short distances, with accuracy, then gradually going further out (but keeping the same degree of accuracy).
<br>
<br>
The magnetic pull of the planet has no effect whatsoever.
<br>
<br>
It would be true to say that some "forms" on the Astral are created from the collective consciousness of people. But this is not true of the actual Astral realms themselves. Likewise, if we construct a building on Earth we only created the building: not the planet.
<br>
<br>
The Astral realms are truly infinite and entirely encompass everything that is Physical, i.e. they encompass not just this planet, but the *whole* of the Physical universe.
<br>
<br>
The technique needed to travel long distances, i.e. to travel through what we call Space and end up on another planet or moon: is to travel to wherever you want to go
<i>
 within the Astral
</i>
. Then, once you reach the target, slip into the RT-zone. Whereupon you will be able to observe the physical surroundings of that planet or moon, in exactly the same way you can on this planet when projecting into the RT zone.
<br>
<br>
As for meeting "aliens" while on the Astral. Well, I never met any little green men but I have interacted with many Astral entities. Plus, I have a regular guide who, on my request, took me to see an Astral Plane Entrance Structure. We flew in this kind of craft which was all incredibly interesting.
<br>
<br>
So maybe my guide is an "alien" from some other planet.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, when you start projecting regularly, with a good degree of control, you cannot help but interact with other beings. There's literally millions of them, all over the place. Therein lies the problem, in the sense that you are never sure where in the universe you are. But there must surely be some accurate way of navigating... clues anyone?

Hi Frank. you mention :
<br>
<br>
Therein lies the problem, in the sense that you are never sure where in the universe you are. But there must surely be some accurate way of navigating... clues anyone?
<br>
<br>
Do you mean navigating the astral or the physical ? If you mean the physical, then using your method (of slipping back into RT zone once you've reached your destination in the physical universe) would mean you'd need to somehow cross reference astral locations with physical ones. If you could do this within the solar system, i.e. within a known realm, then you could "explore" slightly further out on each attempt, and map out your progress.....
<br>
<br>
Only problem with the above is.......I'm assuming that astral realms are neatly "in sync" with the physical universe.....woops.

<br>
Astral...
<br>
<br>
You see, I can project to some populated place within the Astral; I am fully lucid; emotionally closed; thus completely able to interact with resident entities that are open to me. I can also move around at will... but... I haven't got the faintest clue where I am!
<br>
<br>
It's a big problem I'm facing right now, i.e. trying to navigate to somewhere in particular. Monroe, in his two later works, talks about reaching out for someone's IDENT. It's like he could feel some kind of energy that was particular to one being or place that he could somehow home in on.
<br>
<br>
Right now I'm completely stumped as to what he means.

<section>
Haven't read Monroe. But the IDENT does bring to mind something Robert Bruce mentioned. He claims it is possible to project to people you know in the real time zone.......I think he said that you need to have some sort of strong emotional bond with
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///them.ie" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 them.ie
</a>
you can't just project yourself on over to Britney Spear's place.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this type of bond can be formed with an astral entity....this entity might not have to be an actual "person" as such...could it be a structure / building ?
<br>
this might enable you to project to that location. This would mean being emotionally open? problem here is ... you have a limited amount of time to form this "bond".
<br>
<br>
Have you asked your guide about this issue ?

<section>
This is all really interesting.
<br>
Frank, I can see that it is difficult with all the myriad of astral beings out there to tell where they all come from (for some of them, that astral region is their home turf, for others they maybe advanced projectors) and so it is difficult to see who is alien and who isnt. By the way, by alien I mean beings from other phisical civilisations/worlds than ours. I recognise that on an astral level we're all made of the same stuff, but many beings may have different phisical heritages. THIS is what I am interested in here. I think that this would be an excellent project, to contact other beings on the astral who evolved from another phisical civilisation.
<br>
I still think that contact with other RT phisical civilisations would still be one of the biggest turning points in human history. I know that several people here seem to be of the opinion that it doesnt matter, that they dont really care if there is or not, but they should not underestimate the impact of such a discovery.
<br>
I think that the technique if perfected is much more direct than any of the technological means of attempting this such as seti etc. (Of course no hardcore scientists would acept any of the findings if done this way but never mind, at least we would know!)
<br>
<br>
Back to the original point though,
<br>
Does everyone agree that (ok so I accept that it is posible with effort to project into space) some of these so called space obe's, especialy where people travel to Venus and contact adamski style venusians etc have slipped into the astral without realising it?
<br>
I am interesting in knowing the difficulty threshold here as I fancy doing a bit of exploring in this area myself in the future!

I have never attempted space travel yet, so I cannot really comment too well on how difficult it actually is or how accurate people can be. I do agree that people might think they are on Venus or such but are actually just some place on the astral and not on RT zone. But thinking about it does bring up a question. Could this mean that some kind of people once, or maybe will, inhabit Venus or Mars?

Well, I think its only a matter of time befor Mars is colonised.
<br>
Possibly the most realistic account of the colonising of mars is the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson..........amazing stuff, I have little doubt that it will proceed in a way similar to what he describes, with all the politics, social issues etc involved. Give it a read! By the time I had finished them I felt that Mars was totally familiar to me! A trek up Olympus Mons anyone?

Frank, why is that?  Why do you suggest that we travel in the astral realm to a location, and then switch to the RT zone?  Is it because if we travelled that distance only in the RT zone, it would take too long and/or be disorientating?  And once we travel somewhere in the astral, what key things do you do in order to switch back to the RT zone (while still maintaining your location)?

Oy!  I hope, Clandestino, that you did not conclude that by comparing UFO stories to fairytales, I do not believe in UFOs.  Because I doooooooo . . .  and I believe in fairy tales toooooooooo . . . ever hear stories of fairy abductions?
<br>
It's all just a matter of how us mortals describe our otherworldly experiences. I'm fascinated how our definitions have changed over time, yet stayed the same, at some basic level.  Our contacts with otherworldly beings have been going on for millenia.  Being of Celtic origin, and a romantic at heart,  I'm more drawn to the fairy explanations.  Tecchie types seem to prefer the Star Trek/Star Wars versions.  To each his own!
<br>
<br>
I cannot speak of the Astral from personal experience because most of my OBE experiences (that I remember anyway) involve the RT zone.  Ah, maybe someday!!  However, Monroe and his friends spent some time in "outer space" and seemed to be pretty overwhelmed (or was it underwhelmed?)  by how vast and empty and lonely it seemed.  No little green men.
<br>
<br>
However, on the Astral, Monroe met all sorts of folk.  But they did not exist in human time/space.  Which gave me the idea that we humans probably won't find otherworldly beings in the RT zone . . . even the RT Zones on other planets.
<br>

But, shift into other time/space zones, and there will be any number of beings of various origins.  That goes for here on earth as WELL as in outer space.  I'm pretty sure the little green men are here, we just can't see them (and they can't see us!).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is my idea . . . until I disprove it to myself!

sorry Tisha !! reading your post again, i did jump to conclusions ....no offence meant though ! Writing / saying things before i think about them properly is one of my errr...special talents....just ignore it.
<br>
<br>
i agree with ya - as time goes by, us human folk come up with lots of different explanations for things we don't understand. Can you give me some references for fairy abductions ?! im interested.

  Frank, why is that?  Why do you suggest that we travel in the astral realm to a location, and then switch to the RT zone?  Is it because if we travelled that distance only in the RT zone, it would take too long and/or be disorientating?  And once we travel somewhere in the astral, what key things do you do in order to switch back to the RT zone (while still maintaining your location)?

Simply because somehow we have to get around conventional laws of physics. In the Astral dimension, different "laws" obviously apply. It appears you can defy gravity at will, for example, and travel at many times the speed of light. Just two aspects that appear impossible when the Physical is your basis.
<br>
<br>
I also believe that is why there is a so-called technique of switching from RT-zone to Astral by flying off at high speed. There must be a limit to how "fast" you can travel in the RT-zone before you automatically switch to Astral. As for switching back to RT-zone once you arrive, I have absolutely no idea at the moment as I don't yet know how to navigate.

For those of you truly interested in alien encounters, I recommend John E. Mack's books, "Abduction" and/or "Passport to the Cosmos."  Not that I've read them yet . . . but they are on my pile of Books To Read!!!!! (and boy do I have a pile).
<br>
<br>
John Mack is a professor and psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, not to mention a Pulitzer prizewinner . . . he's a "friend of a friend" of mine, someone who's opinion definitely counts for something with me.  My friend read and definitely recommends them.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Mr. Mack researched the alien/UFO phenomenon for over 10 years, and compares modern experiences with the fairy lore and ancient legends (from many cultures) and finds a lot in common with them.  He has many, many many case histories - - - the books are full-of-em.
<br>
<br>
Also . . . for the fairylore lovers out there, I recommend "The Good People: New Fairylore Essays," edited by Peter Narvaez.  It's a rather scholarly collection of fairylore (kind of dry sometimes), but it is indispensable for those of you who might be into Northern European fairylore.  It goes into all sorts of themes:  Fairy abductions, changelings, etc., plus an interesting chapter titled "Between One Blink and the Next: Fairies, UFOs and Problems of Knowledge."
<br>
<br>
Happy Reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another book like the ones Tisha mentioned, is "Grand Illusions" by Dr. Gregory Little.  John Mack's stuff sounds a lot like Little's theory, the EMT theory, that he propones in GI.  I think it's out og print, but I found it at my library.

  What really makes me sceptical thougth is that some people who DO claim to travel to other planets have said that they have projected to Venus or Mars and met martians/Venusians etc ala George adamski, which has got to be a cartload of old horseshit!

Hi Gandalf,
<br>
<br>
Long ago Venus and Mars had life in the physical plane.  There is life on the Astral planet and higher planes on those planets.  I'm not saying you will not find any life on the physical plane of other planets.  But there will most likely be life in the Astral and higher planes of existence on most planets.
<br>
<br>
I think you have to wrong idea what the Astral is.  Both the Physical and Astral planes are planes of illusion.  But the Astral plane is just as real as the Physical.  I think you are assuming that if a Planet does not have an physical life on it that the Astral plane becomes what is termed a �Dead Realm.�  That is not true.  A Dead realm or plane on the Astral has very little to do with the occupants on the Physical plane.  What makes a plane or realm dead in the astral is when there is no more life on the plane or realm of existence.  Even so, the existence of that plane does not suddenly vanish�it slowly.  I know, I know, there�s no time in the Astral  :-)  But I�ll also remind you that the Astral and Physical planes are an illusion :-))  It�s all an illusion, including time.  But it�s our illusion that we believe in and it is our illusion that a plane in the Astral does die and fade away over �time.�  What does it look like?  The colors fade, and things begin to just fade away.
<br>
<br>
But even though I�ve never been to those Planets while out of body I seriously doubt that the Astral life on Venus and Mars have ceased to exist.
<br>
<br>
Peace,
<br>
Paul

Does anybody here ever seen something like ufos while projecting?
<br>
<br>
I know that when someone reachs the same spiritual level has some of you, that people does not care anymore with "stupid" questions. Even so, i think that if i knew how to "get out of the body" i would question directly to the entities that i would find, there origins. I would ask about the world and about the life that they have when in the phsysical or "real" world.
<br>
<br>
It would be nice if some of you do that and them come back and tell what you have learn! It woukd be like an impulse to other people like me (that never projected) to know that things. We would feel more curiosity and interest on the astral world, wich would help us in the efforts to get out of the body.
<br>
<br>
By the way what do you think aboute the guys that in 1997 (?) killed himself to get into the ufo hiden in the comet (don´t remember the name)?

Even though we live in an eternally large universe, that doesn't mean that it's not physical and doesn't exist.  A part of the universe a trillion light years away still exists without our knowledge of it.  We can visit all places on the physical Earth in the astral body, why not be able to visit all places in the physical universe?  Our physical body is bound by rules, not our astral... dimension no longer holds us back, so things such as speed no longer apply.  Everything can be instantaneous if desired, which is why some are able to visit any galaxy they want.  As for looking for landing gear on the moon, I'm not sure anyone has ever tried.  I know that if I was floating in space out of my body, looking for a flag on the moon wouldn't necissarily be my first priority!

  Astral...
  <br>
  <br>
  You see, I can project to some populated place within the Astral; I am fully lucid; emotionally closed; thus completely able to interact with resident entities that are open to me. I can also move around at will... but... I haven't got the faintest clue where I am!
  <br>
  <br>
  It's a big problem I'm facing right now, i.e. trying to navigate to somewhere in particular. Monroe, in his two later works, talks about reaching out for someone's IDENT. It's like he could feel some kind of energy that was particular to one being or place that he could somehow home in on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Right now I'm completely stumped as to what he means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yours,

Hi Frank. From interacting with other beings in the astral and other realms, I learned that they all have a unique 'feeling'. Something that is obvious to you while interacting. Whether it is their own levels of energy or vibration I could not honestly say.  But when I want to see a certain being, I only have to remember their feeling and away I go to meet them.  So I suppose that can be interpreted as an identification process.
<br>
<br>
I have found that the same holds true for places in the astral.  Each has a specific feel that we can register within us and to return there I again remember the feel of the place in order to return there.
<br>
<br>
Hope this was some help.
<br>
<br>
TorosDead, my sentiments exactly. The only impediment I have found to travelling anywhere I choose, has been what I believe about it.  If I clear belief and come from curiosity, nothing else has prevents me from journeying where and when I choose.
<br>
<br>
Kazbadan, there are probably many people here who have interacted with 'aliens' and their craft in the various realms.  I for one have, and will do so again, because I deeply enjoy the work with them.
<br>
<br>
Love always.

I cant tell much about space travel by the astral, but here we have a good proof of time travel by the internet... see you're talking with Gandalf (and the others) with a one year lag [
