<section>
I have recently been using a technique by Sylvan muldoon where I keep reading about astral projection and then before I go to bed I play out a scenario in my mind over and over till I go to sleep. Last night a strange thing occured, I realised i was dreaming and then started to try and induce a projection, this happened and my head started buzzing really strongly. Unfortunatley I stopped this as i was a bit scared. I was wondering if anybody else has had similar experiences and if they could tell me whats going on, and If mr Bruce is reading this, even better as I would really appreciate some advice as it is the second time this has happened. Thankyou for your help,  From Lysear

<section>
Lysear,
<br>
<br>
You were right on the brink of projecting.  It is highly common to project from a dream.  I have done this many times, simply by staring at something in my dream environment.
<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in this same situation again, the important thing to remember is to remain CALM.  By remaining calm, you may find yourself lightly bobbing in and out of your body, almost as if you're slightly disconnected and out of place.  From this position, you can literally roll out of your body onto the floor (or simply use another exit method).
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like you allowed yourself to get scared and tensed up a bit, which will only ruin a successful OBE.
<br>
<br>
Keep trying...you're almost there!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

<section>
it sounds to me like you  unintentionally "found"  the part of your brain which can trigger the  projection reflex.
<br>
<br>
did it feel like a  red hot  ball-bearing was lodged in your brain???
<br>
if so  then it was probably the spot in your brain which, when focused on can induce OBE,   focusing on this spot is how I  projected in  the 2 obe's  ive had.
<br>
<br>
I find focusing on this spot simpler than rope or any other  tecnique,  but i can never seem to isolate it consiously,  i  always  wake up/ become aware whilst its active.
<br>
<br>
i  assume you, like all of us want to project...next time focus on it!!!

<br>
if  what your talking about is what i think it is then hopefully youll suddenly be out-of-body  if you focus on it long enough.
<br>
<br>
jeff's  right,  it sounds like fear held you back.

The buzzing in the head is your crown Chakra switching on.
<u>
 It's very normal
</u>
. Just relax into it, think of where you want to project to, and away you go. You were right on the verge of saying goodbye Physical, hello Astral.
<br>
<br>
Feeling the buzzing in your head is as normal to Astral Projection, as is hearing the engine running when you start your car. There is NOTHING to be afraid of, in other words.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi,
<br>
<br>
The buzzing I think could be described as your holochakra becoming active and entering what is known as a vibrational state - very pleasant, very common, very good for ones overall energetic balance and very good to learn how to induce this using your will.
<br>
<br>
I think you should know our chakras are always "on" although sometimes that the energies in and around a particular chakra are more active than at other times.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes it occurs throughout your entire body or sometimes only in a particular part.  When occurring in a particular part or maybea particular chakra it is possible to expand the vibrational state so it happens throughout your entire body - this happens because all our chakras are part of an energetic body (called by some the holochakra), so as a crude analogy you can think of the energies in this body (or any of your bodies) as being similar to blood - being pumped and circulated all the time - helping to energise and sustain this physical body .
<br>
<br>
This activation of energies or vibrational state "loosens the glue" of the denser energies of the holochakra (which connect the astral body to the physical body).  Incidentally it is this holochakra that forms the Silver Cord the can be observed and experienced by projectors.
<br>
<br>
As the othes have said - relax, focus your will power on your target and let it happen.  Persist and enjoy.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Jeff

hi, just Lysear again, it happened again last night! my mantra must be paying off! For the last month I have been telling myself before I go to bed that "I wish to dream of flying tonight" and then visualising a series of events ending up with me out of my body. although last night it wasnt as pronounced as the previous, its still great progress!

Please see my recently posted 9/26/02 topic Buzzing/rining.  I think we have experienced the same thing.
