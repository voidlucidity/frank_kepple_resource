Hello guys,
<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever projected into a black hole? Black holes are believed to suck in everything within a certain radius of themselves. Could they take our projected doubles away from us?

Well, theres no way of knowing for sure since I doubt anyones visited a black hole, the only positively known existence of a black hole is at the centre of galaxys - including our own.
<br>
<br>
But hypothetically if we go on observations from Astral / OOB experiences  then a black hole would have no effect on our astral double, of course even if it did suck it in the chances are that our so called silver cord is an ancor to your body and the double could use it to 'pull itself out' of the black hole.
<br>
<br>
Most notably however, a black hole is merely a gravitational well of great magnitude which is why light isnt fast enough to get past, whereas the hypothetical Tachyon  which (if it exists)  travels faster than light, could get passed depending upon its speed.
<br>
Anyway, since our projected double isnt effected by Earth gravity or the sun (people have flown to the sun) then chances are, gravity has null effect, thus a black hole would have null effect.
<br>
<br>
So anyone planning on visiting the super massive black hole at the centre of the milky way, dont worry.

I'm not sure if he has actually been there, but he sure has theories on the subject with real references to actual physics.

Black holes, red holes, blue holes: however devastating the phenomenon they are all matters to do with the physical-realm. In fact, the whole idea of one's self being harmed is a physical-realm construct only. It's come about simply because it is possible for your physical body to be placed in a situation where it will cease to function. That's the one big problem with physical matter... it has a certain shelf-life.
<br>
<br>
But once you step out of this physical realm, then you step within the realms where time no longer exists; nothing ever degrades; there is no death; nothing and no-one can possibly harm you... unless, of course, you believe it. I mean, there are millions and millions of people trapped in the belief-system regions undergoing the most hellish experiences.
<br>
<br>
I've had first-hand experience of many of these cases. Often I would think perhaps, for them, it would be a mercy if they could die. But they cannot. And many become trapped in a state of undergoing a kind of nasty, perpetual death.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

We know that astral projection goes beyond the physical and that is why most of us are interested in it. The confusion comes from thinking of the astral body as an energy body. It seems like different forms of energy should still be able to interact with each other. A black hole is not just collapsed matter. Often in addition to gravitational fields there are magnetic fields of extraordinary power. Even light is bent into them and cannot escape. Why not other forms of energy such as an energy body? And if an energy body cannot interact at all with a black hole and its energies then how can it observe it very well? It seems like it should be one or the other. The only way I know of to make sense of it is to say that it is not an energy body in the sense that electricity and heat are energy, but that it is a mental body.

Is this the same as a tunneling experience? I use to have a little system which worked for me ok. Then I was at someone else's house (my aunt) I attempted to travel but got caught up into a tunnel going downward. It took awhile but I finally managed to get out. For the rest of that night everytime I closed my eyes I was faced with this same tunnel. I gave this sort thing up for a long time after that. Even to this day I have a fear I didn't have before. Could it have been related to the place I was in at the time that caused this tunnel experience?

<section>
i dont have as much experience as everyone else here but the tunnel experience, from wot i have read in astral dynamics, is the entrance to the astral planes... just ur angle of perception is different, instead of being flat that it normally like on approach it is tunnel like, this is just all to do with perception of it.
<br>
<br>
not sure if this helps

Hi guys!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your responses! I see what you mean about the astral body not being affected by physical forces. That's what I kinda figured.
<br>
<br>
Wisp, don't be afraid of the tunneling thing; it's just you entering the astral! Were you really tired that night? Sometimes if I come home late, I find myself going OOB against my will whilst trying to sleep. It can be really scary and annoying when you're just trying to sleep!
<br>
<br>
Tom, I'll have to get ahold of a copy of Adventures Beyond the Body and check those pages out.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>

Jargon, thanks for the clue. I need to read some I see. Maybe it was a perception angle.
<br>
<br>
Kodemaster, thanks for your reply too. No, can't say I was all that tired. I had taken a long trip that same day (in the physical that is).
<br>
<br>
I can't imagine going through this again. I  have always experienced an outward feel, though I don't think I've really ever had the classic obe. If this is typical, wow!
