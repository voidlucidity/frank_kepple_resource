Whle sleeping soundly the other night, I was suddenly awakened by the intense smell of flowers, like a strong perfume. The smell was concentrated very strongly in my bedroom but I got up to check the house, because I thought someone might be in my home, or that the cat had knocked over something, causing it to spill. I could get whiffs of it as I walked through  my house, but nowhere was it as strong as in my bedroom. Did this have any meaning? It was so strange...but I know it must mean something.

Usually associated with the presence of good spirits/entities I think. Can't offer much more I am afraid! Were you having nice dreams at the time, before waking? Feel anything "out there"?

Do not worry Foxmaiden.  I have this happen frequently to me.  The smell I get most often is most akin to lavender inscence.  What is interesting is to ask others if they can smell it also.  I have asked my husband several times but he did not smell it.  I figured out later that what is happening is that our astral bodies can smell, hear, feel, taste etc. just like our physical bodies. As we open up our spiritual body becomes aware of these astral smells, sounds, etc.  I have one spirit guide that is dressed like a Buddist monk and smells of lavender inscence.  Do not be concerned if the smells are pleasant.  The stronger the smell likely the more open your spiritual body is becoming and the more recently the guide was there.

I often smell what I assume to be spirits-   I smell roses and a smell like Autumn evenings and I feel comfort or happiness
<br>
<br>
Like Violet I am usually the only one that can smell these things.
<br>
<br>
I have on occasion met w/ an odor I describe as an electrical burning smell-   this has very negative feelings including one time when I actually felt nauseous until I left the house-   I figure this may be unhappy spirits but I'm not sure.   Oddly enough the nausea time was also the only time I heard anything w/these feelings-  a sound like sizzling bacon but very low.

I can think about one catholic saint--Padre Pio whose stigmata were emitting a wonderful smell. Also some people would suddenly get a whiff of this perfume while turning to him in prayer...even after his death.  Interestingly,  different people would name different smells... some roses, some tobacco..
<br>
<br>
He was blessed with many other psychic gifts as well like reading people`a minds, bilocation and future prediction.

Hi Foxmaiden,

When a person smells flowers in the room one of your relatives are visiting even relatives that you many not remember but they remember you.
