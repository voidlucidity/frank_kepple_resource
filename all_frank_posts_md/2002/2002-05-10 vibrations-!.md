Could any of you shed some light on the vibrations.
<br>
<br>
To me they are spontanious, they seem to come by themselves, in the "trance" state.
<br>
<br>
Do some of you have opinions on how to bring them about. Or, are they automatic when you reach a certain level, "body asleep-mind awake".
<br>
In one topic Frank talked about "thinking about them in a certain way".
<br>
<br>
And those of you who are seasonned OBE, once they are there, what do you do ?  Do you let yourself carried with them ? Do you act on them ?

i also had spontanious vibrations, they waked me in my sleep. after reading astral dynamics  i found that it was relatively easy to bring them on using techniques in the book. my goal now is to have more concious and vivid obe experiences.

I'm also in the same situation, with the same results from using the techniques from Robert's book (AD). My reason for asking is that for a lot of us trying to get their first OBE, we sort of get stuck at the threeshold.
<br>
There's possibly the "mind-split" effect for many of us, problem in downloading the memories of the projection.
<br>
So, I'm wondering if the failure to exit that occurs so often, could be in the way you act when the vibrations hits you. Hope that I am clear enough !

<section>
sounds like a question for the more experienced. i felt not like i was getting stuck, but clearing pathways so that i could get to the same place with less "drama" (which seems distracting) occuring. where are you getting stuck, is it the same place each time? i think i have gone the point of experiencing the falling sensation but finding myself out of body but with a lapse of time since i do not have memories of leaving and moving away.

When I get the vibrations, Ive always done some sort or exercise to try and get out at that point (ie rope, floating, whatever)
<br>
<br>
For the first time a week or two ago, I just focused on the vibrations and tried to magnify them... and I had the most conscious exit/obe to date.
<br>
<br>
Usually when I try using any method once I reach vibrations..I end up waking myself up or sometimes I just seem to loose consciousness and wake up OBE (and have very confusing obes at that point).
<br>
so
<br>
<br>
Try doing nothing, instead of something =)
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  This is really strange..I just started thinking about the vibes while writing this...and I keep getting these weird vibrations in the back of my head and down my spine...hmm its just like the second I read the word vibrations I started to feel some, but of course I'm fully awake... What the hell?
<br>
<br>
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/You must try some of my purple berries.
<br>
I've been eating them for 6 or 7 weeks now, haven't got sick once.

<br>
<br>
This sounds like a good idea.. Might try it out. So, how exactly did you manage do get out? Did you just naturally buzz free after the vibrations hit a certain point of intensity?

Hey all,
<br>
<br>
I'm at this point as well, so I figured I should contribute to our confusion even more.

<br>
<br>
Here's what's been happening lately:
<br>
<br>
1. I lie perfectly still for about an hour, give or take fifteen minutes.
<br>
2. While I'm lying perfectly still, I try to drift, or rock, or detach myself, or focus on my breathing, or do energy work, or let my mind wander.
<br>
3. As long as I'm rested enough, I don't fall asleep.
<br>
4. At some point, the vibrations come. An intense "roaring" sensation.
<br>
5. Each onset of vibration is accompanied by an
<i>
 incredible
</i>
tugging sensation, like something has grabbed ahold of my entire body and is pulling
<i>
 hard
</i>
.
<br>
7. With each pull the the roaring increases to hurricane intensity.
<br>
6. With each pull I feel an intense but strangely bareable pain somewhere in my lower abodomen. All the trouble spots are clustered fairly close together. I think it's a safe bet I've got some blockages in this area.
<br>
<br>
Last night I first almost went out my feet, then almost went out my head. I also sunk partially into the bed (about 2cm), which felt exactly like pushing through a closed door during an obe.
<br>
<br>
Once I woke up from a brief period of unconsciousness, and was pulled out through my feet through a series of about 4 pulls. Each pull brought me farther down the bed, 'til I slithered off. I don't remember whether there were vibrations.
<br>
<br>
Once I woke up, tingling, from a dream. I pushed myself out quite easily. The roaring swept up my body and I went right through my skull.
<br>
<br>
And that about sums up all of my experiences, I believe. I'll be trying again every night, now that I'm done with school for a bit.

"o, how exactly did you manage do get out? Did you just naturally buzz free after the vibrations hit a certain point of intensity?"
<br>
<br>
Thats exactly what happened.  They were just mild vibrations kind of running along my spine and the back of my head. I strained to hear them (mentally anyway) and feel them, and they increased rather fast until the point that I just kind of shot out.  I have to mention that the vibrations were a bit intense though.  It was like I was bouncing up and down until I just broke free.  kind of oscillating like...
<br>
<br>
The weird thing is, I shot into the next room and actually had to like.... slow myself down.  It wasnt like I floated out at all.
<br>
but it was a much needed change from loosing consciousness and waking up obe all confused.  I liked the conscious exit much more

just today I had spontaneous vibrations in my right leg.  lested for a couple seconds and then went away.  haven't had any spontaneous full vibrations yet though...
<br>
<br>
I did manage to induce one case of the vibrations (I'm pretty new)... it felt like that "flutter" you get in the pit of your stomach, but all over my body.  is that right, or was it something else?

<section>
Johnathon,
<br>
<br>
This is my opinion based upon personal experience:  If you are feeling a "flutter," it is more likely that your "etheric" (energy) body is shifting about and coming loose, which is a good sign.
<br>
<br>
If you get a true vibration, you will KNOW it!  It's kind of like this:  Have you ever tried to launder a quilt or heavy blanket in the washing machine, and it hear it get all imbalanced during the spin cycle? The whole washing machine starts to shake and make a horrible noise, you can feel the whole thing from the opposite end of your house!   To me, a body vibration feels just like that.  It's nearly impossible to confuse it with anything else.
<br>
<br>
Keep it up - - - it's coming along for you.
<br>
<br>
regards,
<br>
tisha

<section>
<br>
<br>
Yes, absolutely correct the above post. If you find yourself "wondering" about whether you "might" be feeling vibrations, then you are probably not.
<br>
<br>
I think people sometimes think the vibrations are something you have to imagine in your mind somehow. No, it actually *feels* like your whole physical body is buzzing and vibrating.
<br>
<br>
The analogy of the spin-cycle is a good one. Imagine if the machine was unbalanced as Tisha says and think of how your physical body would vibrate if you were sitting on it. That is very much like the feeling. Only the big difference is, whilst it feels like your physical body is vibrating, it isn't.
<br>
<br>
What has happened is your sense of conscious awareness has disconnected from your physical-body and connected to the Astral body. It is the Astral-body that is vibrating. However, at first, because your sense of conscious awareness has been so used to experiencing physical-body sensations, you automatically think it's the physical body.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Well I don't neccisarily think its true.
<br>
I feel them lightly in my spine sometimes when Im sitting here.
<br>
Usually if I induce them I start to feel them in my spine and it grows and slowely encompasses my entire body until finally spreading to my head, then becomes very strong.
<br>
<br>
Of course if i wake up with them spontaneously then they are really intense from the beginning (sometimes uncomfertably so)
<br>
<br>
but lately, i can seem to spot little vibrations beginning in my spine and amplify them to the point of intensity of the spontaneous ones
<br>
yeah

When I had my first and only OOBE what happened was I layed until I was so rested my body felt heavy, not long after I began to get really hot but instead of moving I just remained still which is when the vibrations started but since the first time ive not been able to magnify the vibrations, I start getting hot like before and hear the tiniest hint of vibration but it never stops long or gets louder.

Hi, it's me again - I'm new to this website and am only just in the middle of Astral Dynamics.  According to Mr. Bruce, early projections seem to cause more of a ruckus than later ones.  Once you've had several deliberate/successful OBEs, the exits quiet down.
<br>
<br>
All of my OBEs (aware of them during the past three years) have been spontaneous and MOST unwelcome, until the last one when I thought, oh, what the heck, and actually downloaded some good memories from my projected double.  Come to think of it, over time, my vibrations HAVE become less intense for me.  Right now I'd say they feel/sound more like a large buzzing plane flying low overhead.  But that's after three years of spin-cycle intensity.
<br>
<br>
My advice to newcomers to the OBE world:  Expect a ruckus at first.  That way you are less likely to freak out!  Those with slight and controllable buzzings for vibrations should consider themselves LUCKY (or really, really advanced, my hat is raised to them!).  The day I can feel a slight buzz in my spine and WOOOP! out I go . . .  ah, that will be the day!
<br>
<br>
I just realized Quebec had more questions:  What to do once you are out was one of them.  Quebec, jump right back in your body with the intent of remembering EVERYTHING.  If you float about all night, you are likely never to remember a thing.  And DO read Astral Dynamics!  I'm so glad I bought that book!

Hi Tisha!
<br>
<br>
I have bought and read many times now Robert's book. It seems that the more you read it, the more you learn.
<br>
<br>
My questions around the vibrations is for me and all the people out there on this forum who are trying (sometimes for many years) to get an OBE.
<br>
<br>
From Robert's book and some of you experienced OBE's, projection "is a tricky business !"
<br>
<br>
Me and many members of this forum get stuck near the exit. We get the vibrations (or their beginning), cobweb etc...etc... but we don't exit.
<br>
<br>
After the first OBE, you have the most valuable information...YOU KNOW !
<br>
<br>
After that first one you know what to expect, and you will not have so many questions, which might seem trivial.
<br>
<br>
That is why so many ask questions on the exit, and where your experiences would be very helpfull.  By sharing your experiences on what  you do once you are near the exit (vibrations etc...).  Concentration, breathing, awareness etc...
<br>
<br>
I am fully aware that we are all different, and that there are many ways to project, but as in Robert's book (the steam method, the rope, the ladder, the bounce, the rocket etc...) untill that first OBE, every little detail counts.
<br>
<br>
The requisites for OBE seems to be:
<br>
1-   Deep relaxation
<br>
2-   The trance (body-asleep/mind awake)
<br>
3-   Clear mind (absence of thought)
<br>
4-   Energy (practicing the NEW)
<br>
<br>
The trick part for many of us is at the exit...we get on the threeshold but can't get out.
<br>
<br>

<section>
Hello again everyone, gee I love this forum . . .
<br>
<br>
Since most of my OBEs have been spontaneous, aI can do is tell you what it feels like, and give my opinions!
<br>
<br>
I will state one opinion here - - all the while willing to consider dissenting opinions:  The reasons many of us botch our OBE attempts at the point of exit (presuming we initially have the deep relaxation thing down) it that we're getting all excited over the shifting of our energy bodies - -  because it does feel pretty cool - - -  thinking, "Is this a vibration?  Oh boy is it finally going to happen?  That very excitement causes us to lose the deep relaxation needed for the exit.  I've decided to try a different tack with my deliberate OBE attempts:  I'm going to meditate/trance with the very intention of feeling my energy body shift and wobble, WITHOUT trying to push myself into an OBE.  I'm going to get SO used to the shifty feeling that it absolutely BORES me to death and it ceases to cause an excited or expectant reaction.  I'll let everyone know if it works.
<br>
<br>
So here's what it feels like to me before the vibrations happen:
<br>
<br>
1.  I'm sleeping or resting.  Sometimes I'm in that inbetween state of sleep/awake.  I trance very easily (it's both a blessing and a curse, no one wants to ride in my car when I'm driving!), so I rarely have to work at getting in the right space.  Suffice it to say I assume the position for an OBE.
<br>
<br>
2.  I feel my energy-body start to shift.  Imagine what it must feel like to be a hard boiled egg when someone is peeling off your shell . . . something feels as though it is separating.  Sometimes it feels like a little wobble or a flutter.  Wobbly is a good word.  Most of the wobbling/shifting is in my UPPER body, from my upper chest up to the top of my head.   Since I'm laying absolutely still it makes no sense that I feel as though I'm moving . . . it really does FEEL as though I have separated from my body just a LITTLE bit.     When this happens I try to lay absolutely still and act really, really bored by the phenomenon.  "Ho hum, here I go . . ."
<br>
<br>
(please note that I often botch it at this point too!)
<br>
<br>
3.  If you are in an uncomfortable position when you start to feel wobbly/shifty, DO NOT MOVE, JUST PUT UP WITH IT, you can ask your friends to massage your sore body parts tomorrow.  Believe it or not, the wobbly feeling doesn't last very long,  just a few seconds for me when I go off spontaneously.  If I move, I've blown it!
<br>
<br>
4.  Now, here is the truly tricky part.  I'm of two minds here (I believe in the OBE world, this counts as a pun).  Because I know what brings on a vibration for me if I'm calm and deliberate:  When I want to bring on the vibrations faster, I imagine sinking, and that seems to bring them on.  So if you find yourself "wobbly" or "fluttery" or "shifty"  and the vibrations don't happen after 15 seconds or so, you might want to try FEELING (not visualizing) yourself sinking deep into your bed or your chair as though someone were pressing down upon you, and pressing down HARD, without letting up.  Sometimes I think, "DOWN . . . . DOWN . . . . DOWN . . . . . DOWN .. . . . DOWWWNNNN . ..  . . . . . .  DOWWWWNNN . . ."
<br>
<br>
5.  Then AGAIN (and here is my second opinion on the subject), you might want to do NOTHING.  NADA. ZIPPO.  Because trying to do something might break your relaxation and ruin the experiment.  Of course, if you've been trying and trying with doing nothing and nothing doesn't work, try sinking.
<br>
<br>
6.  The vibrations are the point of no return, in my opinion, so you do not have to "do" anything besides relax into them, taking everything you feel/hear in stride, knowing that you are SAFE AND SOUND and that you are going to be all right no matter what!!!!!!  When they happen spontaneously, I feel sinking and vibrations, and hear roaring/buzzing, all at the same time.  It almost doesn't matter what I feel because you might feel different; but just know that once the vibrations take over, you are most often paralyzed and that is IT, you are having an OBE, and you probably couldn't botch it at that point if you TRIED.
<br>
<br>
That's all I can say for now!  If I have another experience, and feel something new or different, I'll write about it . . .
<br>
