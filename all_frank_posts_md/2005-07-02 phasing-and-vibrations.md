I just have one simple question. Is it possible that the vibrations felt during traditional OBE attempts are actually the feeling of something "your other body" 180 degrees out of phase.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The classic vibrations are the energetic sensations felt from the various energy centres that act as an interface between the pure subjective energy of consciousness and the physical brain and body. People who specifically practice "energy work" regularly experience all manner of energetic sensations including vibrations of various types.
<br>
<br>
Practicing the Phasing approach can lead a person to feeling mild energetic sensations that are typically felt as a slight static-electricity type of feeling. Tingling and crackling sounds that can sound rather like the hissing of high voltage electricity pylons when it's damp and the air is very humid. But that's about it.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
