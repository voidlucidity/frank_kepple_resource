Hi,
<br>
<br>
I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere on this site, but I noticed a thread on another site criticising Robert Bruce and wondered what people here thought about it:

Looks to me more like an open debate rather than a critical thread.
<br>
Everyone must have there own opinions or we'd all be rather boring no?

I just read over the thread there and would have to agree with Parmenion. There are a variety of reponses from people. The person who initiated the post (and a poll) had received four pages of responses when I took a look, seems like reasonable debate rather than criticism.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

People are free to criticise. And anyone who is anyone has their critics. Whichever way you look at it, Astral Dynamics is a book and a half, and it'll be a while yet before someone can better it.

Hello,
<br>
<br>
I read this thread already before you post it here Boomy. Like Parmenion and Nick I don't think they are criticising Robert Bruce in the way you mean.
<br>
<br>
It's just a normal thread asking for the experiences of people who read the work of Robert Bruce. Naturally some people are positive, other negative and others again neutral. Everybody is different no?
<br>
<br>
And the succes of the methods of RB is not entirely dependent of his methods only ofcourse. You harvest what you sow...
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Ebele

I think that the reason that some folks were getting defensive on that topic was because of the Subject Line,
<b>
 "Robert Bruce: For Real?"
</b>
, which could be taken to be insinuated that Robert Bruce is a charlatan.  That is sort of how I took it when I first read it.
<br>
<br>
The text of the post itself just seems to ask if folks have had success with his methods.  But the subject line could easily be misinterpreted.
<br>
<br>
I think the creator of that thread phrased it that way because he is jealous of the attention people give Robert Bruce.

I would no sooner look upon Robert Bruce as some kind of saviour as I would Robert Monroe, but both have helped me a great deal in different areas.
<br>
<br>
So far Bruce's methods for AP have not helped me at all, but things like his Catchbasket concept, and instructions on seeing auras have been very useful.
<br>
<br>
Read and absorb what suits you individually, neither idolise or pan the author. After all, these aren't books on maths or physics where the rules are known.
<br>
<br>
James.

I registered with that site just to post a reply to that thread.  I think Robert's work is amazing...he is honest, simple and scientific in his approach.
<br>
<br>
In my personal communications with him I have found him to be a most sincere and kindly person.

Is hard for a lot of people to give praise to another person.  What I saw a lot of is "if the book doesnt get most people who read it to project he must not be any good".
<br>
<br>
The person who started the thread seemed to have a chip on his/her shoulder and even started it with what sounded like "here he has all these fans and he doesn't deserve it".  As if we sit around talking about the wonders of RB 24/7 at this forum.
<br>
<br>
Another funny criticism I saw was the idea he is TRYING to make this stuff complicated.  Im one who believes if you dont like a book write something better.  Instead a lot are complaining there are already books on AP so why should they recognize anyone else with talent or who is helpful.
<br>
<br>
Who here is saying RB is a savior?  But often I question the motives of people who criticize another author when they are trying to write a book themselves.  Maybe they'd like more attention to their own talents.
<br>
<br>
Im not one for criticizing people who are high profile, I try to criticize their work as if they're not even known.  Its as if enough people liking your work is a reason for so many more to stand up and poke holes in it.  whereas often if a person discovers a little known book they'll declare it a masterpiece if it's decent.  Its like when a movie has a lot of hype it never seems to be as good as when you see a movie that surprises you by being brilliant.
<br>
<br>
If you've read the whole book then fine criticize the points you dont like.  But to say astral dynamics made things complicated on purpose and didnt focus on HOw to project suggests a person didnt read the whole book.  And thats annoying.

I check the thread just now but can't seem to find it anymore.
<br>
<br>
Could it be that the moderator which (the original poster is a moderator) delete it?

Terry: I managed to access it just now. I read through the additional responses and it's all a bit more of the same.
