During a OBE  will I see demonic figures? Should I be scared of anything I come across during this? What if I see another figure, how should I approach this other figure?

Hello,
<br>
<br>
These are just normal thoughts if you've never OBE'd. I'm trying to achieve OBEs, and I also had that thoughts running in my mind. Fact is that from all the information I found I never read of somebody got hurt physically or whatsoever. The only thing demonic figures can do is scare the excrement out of you. And that only happens when you
<i>
 accept
</i>
or
<i>
 decide
</i>
(unconsciously) to get scared!
<br>
<br>
However you have to realize that the instant you think of your body or intend to move part of your body, you will be zapped back into your body directly automatically.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
Ebele
<br>

<section>
Thxs for the replies.
<br>
<br>
But I get scared easily of just thinking of Demonic things. So if i was having a OBE and since I am scared of seeing a demonic figure will it be projected since it is being thought about in my mind?
<br>
<br>
If I do see a scary figure should I step up to it like I AINT SCARED YOU BASTARD!!! [8D][

Robert Bruce write a good article on this:

<br>
<br>
Personnaly, I recommand to buy the Astral Dynamics book from Mr. Bruce and read it seriously. It is not expensive and you'll know the subject well before trying obe. This is also good to have the book beside you as a reference when trying obe and having any kind of interrogation.

If you're scared, they will know because they read your thoughts. You cant fake not being scared. If you're scared, you cant do OBE.

I've heard of OBEers to have fought battles (sparring or otherwise) with non-human creatures while OB. I was told that they can't hurt you, so it's OK even if they are around, I guess.
<br>
Anyone know better?

The problem of astral projection or obe is that all our fear, expectation, desire, personality, all get projected to the outside. Often they will look very real. That's why being scared will almost guarantee the experience will be scary.
<br>
<br>
In my sleep pralysis or onset of OBE I've seen many things which doesn't make sense, people coming in, being touched or pulled out of my body, sensing presence, hearing strange sound and other thing. I admit that sometime I do feel afraid. But when I try to take control of my feeling, the feeling of dread dissipate and I found out that there is not much to be feared. Also sometime I've been frightened by my own projected double which might be related to mind split effect.
<br>
<br>
Try searching for keyword "presence" in OBE and astral conciousness section. There are nany interesting thread regarding that.

<section>
I call this presence the Watcher.  Or, Guardian, or Spike, or whatever I feel like calling it at the time.  I think it's really a part of me, trying to protect myself. It doesn't like change, because change is scary.  So it tries to "boo!" me back into my body.
<br>
<br>
I just tell it, "I understand you don't like change, you don't want me to get hurt, but I really need to move on here."

It depends. I used to be scared of OOBE too. In my experience sometimes the demonic figures are real, sometimes glimpses of distant things past or far off but symbolized, and sometimes renderings of internal mental states. For instance, my lower self has appeared as a pair of giant aggressive spiders before. in a dream/oobe.

People naturally get scared. The only real complications arise when people start dwelling on it. The best way is to accept it, recognise fears for what they are, and move on.

Don't let the idea that there are some bad spirits frighten you. Your chances of meeting one are very slim, and the funny thing is, they are terrified of you. There are all sorts of creatures on Earth that try to make themselves look bigger and meaner to scare away predators or something they are afraid of. There is a bullfrog that does this, it bloats itself up like a bubble to scare away predators and will do this in any situation. Imagine the astral-wildlife this way. They can take on any form they desire, as can you with enough practice. All you have to do is confront them even in the slightest manner and you will find there is nothing to be afraid of. I use to have nightmares and I eventually found out the being i was afraid of was my spirit guide

Beleive me, you have nothing to be afraid of, understand and you won't fear it anymore.

<section>
hey, I just found this forum last week and I can relate to you being scared. fear is just what it is though, "Fear". The quote their is nothing to fear except fear itself is quite true in this case. The fears you will encounter take on the forms of your own fears and will only hinder any obe experience you may have.
<br>
<br>
Once you acknowledge the feeling that your scared, then it is easier to focus on how "not" to be scared. It took quite a few experiences for myself to overcome the fear. I didnt just stop being scared after my first experience with voices and shapes. It took quite a few experiences to recognize when I was started to get scared, and keep those feelings in check. The fear is normal, and I think the sooner you can recognize fear, the sooner you will be able to understand how to not let it stop you from experiencing obe.
<br>
<br>
For myself, all the fears connected with obe were enhanced by my own imagination and once I was projected, I found that I was more curious/disorientated than afraid.
<br>
<br>
If your like me, I think your imagination will do a better job to create fears than the actual obe. Have you experienced the vibrations, noises or obe sensations yet?

Anyone having problems overcoming their fears should try to develop the idea of courage. For one balances out the other. Problem is, dwelling upon any particular emotion just exemplifies the effects of that emotion. Which is why dwelling on the positive side of things is rather more beneficial.

I read somewhere that courage is not a lack of fear, but rather the act of pushing through your fear to do the thing you are afraid of.
<br>
<br>
Would this help in an OBE?  Or would the slightest feeling of fear send you back to your body before you could try to push through it?

Tell me something... when you project, you are still in this world ? or do you enter another demension ? does everyone project to the same place, this means all you can meet ?
<br>
<br>
If it is so, you could go to the place where someone is projecting and clear the place to remove the negative guys...
<br>
<br>
I wonder why there are no drawings of "astral wildlife"...

RiderGZ,
<br>
<br>
Good topic! With a few of the astral sessions I have, there is sometimes a point where fear raises its head. As Frank mentioned earlier, what I will try to do as well, is to recognize it and move on. Sometimes though, it does get a bit too much, and I get zapped out of it and have to start over. One of the great things about this forum is a topic like this. You realize other people have similar experiences, and everyone can benefit from each other's advice.
<br>
<br>
Very best,
<br>
