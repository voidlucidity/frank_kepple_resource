yo how do I get some women, because there isn't a way to get them myself, for some reason they aren't attracted to me as in talking, and i'm a very nice man and don't act perverted around them, they seem to be close-minded I need to figure out how to make them more receptive to me because if they were more receptive then there may not be the same problems. what usually happens is that they look me over and like what they see and are physically attracted very much, then when they give me their number we talk but I always have to call back or else I never hear from them again, and being alone all the time is driving me mad. it's great to have you people to help me a little but I need someone to talk to in person, and that is what  I need from a woman is someone to talk about my problems too, but the only thing they wan't from me is sex sometimes, but then they don't even call back to do that. please post anything you know to make people more open-minded magic or not.

<section>
There are two general approaches to the matter you are describing. The first is to try to change the women in your environment. The second is to change yourself to become more attractive to the women in your environment. You are already learning ways to increase your energy through techniques like NEW. The other side to this is to examine yourself for core images and remove them. When you get rid of the things in your energy body which are the most negative, you will bring more positive situations and energies into your life. It does not take long to work, either. A couple of months of daily core image removal should do the job. I've heard that EFT (www.emofree.com or something like that) has a technique to do the same thing.

( jeeezz..!even if it had been the best night of my life and you'd pay me I still wouldn't call...!!!.) - I have my rules, and most girls do to.
<br>
&lt;lol, I just reread my post..I didn't mean "pay me" "for the sex" ofcourse!!! &gt;

<br>
<br>
But...first things first..what do you want the women for? For sex or love..??
<br>
In the meantime, whatever the reason is..I'll give you one tip:
<br>
Do some more calling. It shows us that you care.I know we were fighting for equality, but I don't know ANY woman, who deeply deeply inside doesn't wish for a man who does most of the dialling..(we're talking about first stages here right??)
<br>
This is simple psychology not magic. I know some "magical" tricks (working with your aura) but they are rated X and I don't want the moderators to get a heart attack

I was serious about the benefits of removing core images. The process of removing negativity isn't just about preventing problems with negs. It is also about attracting more positive situations, energies, people, and so on.

There is a tool for every task. Magic is a tool for some tasks but not for this task Archdragon.
<br>
<br>
Long term relationships can only come from a meeting of two spirits who love each other.
<br>
<br>
NO WAY, BUT NO WAY can you use magic to "make" that happen.  There is only one way that magic could be of any help. That is the kind that is used to increase your luck and your potential chances of meeting your soul mate.  This is not about coercing magically the individual to turn up either. This is about affecting your own path and your own chances of coming across this person and recognising them.
<br>
<br>
It is down to you and only you-without magic to then make the step of recognizing that person.
<br>
<br>
What I said about enhancing your luck and your potential chances? You can make a bigger difference by exploring your world more in this regard. Whether it's personals, singles clubs, bars/clubs, travel, outdoor adventure.....the list goes on-I guess you get the idea.
<br>
I did use the net, to arrange to meet people then I went out and met them.
<br>
<br>
Does that seem a bit conventional rather than magicking up my life partner?
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
. Just a thought, and yes I do practice a form of magic in my daily life.

ARCH buddy, i have a subscription to an awesome guy name dave. i am going to show you 1out of 1,000,000,000,000,000 mailing i got. these are questions/comments/ect.. and followed by a quick solution to the problem or the question.
<br>
here is one of them.. oh and i wear this stuff is JUUUUST like magick i swear i swear!! it is basically, NOT BEING A WUSS to a girl. suck as for example being cocky and funny and you learn so much, it is amazing!!
<br>
here is one, not a very good one but i picked this one because it is the shortest to read:
<br>
<br>
***QUESTION***
<br>
<br>
Dear Dave,
<br>
<br>
First off, props to you on the book. The book is really
<br>
about how to take control of your life and get what
<br>
you want from it. That's awesome. I dated this really
<br>
gorgeous chick that was in med school. I did the whole
<br>
cocky and funny routine. Works like magic. Here's
<br>
an example: "I love you, V." Me laughing ... I love
<br>
me too. That's when I had to bail on her. She even
<br>
bought me some pimp Versace gear.
<br>
<br>
I am stuck in a difficult situation. Due to the way
<br>
I look, dress, and talk, girls assume that I am a
<br>
player. I am very,very inexperienced however. I have
<br>
had a few times where I am about to seal the deal,
<br>
and some girl will ask me, "How many girls have you
<br>
been with ?" or "You are a player aren't you ?" I
<br>
have never sealed the deal and if I tell them this
<br>
they don't believe me and some will just get mad and
<br>
leave. I am not sure what I should say in this situation.
<br>
I think some of your book is based on being able to
<br>
kiss properly such as the kiss test or the c+f comment,
<br>
"I don't even know if you kiss well. " I do not even
<br>
know how to kiss properly. I can be cocky and funny
<br>
and can attract girls but then I don't know how to
<br>
be cocky and funny and bring up that I have never
<br>
done anything. Please help me resolve this because
<br>
armed with my determination and my improving skills.
<br>
 <br>
  V-Man
  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   &gt;&gt;&gt;MY COMMENTS:
   <br>
   <br>
   You're too much.
   <br>
   <br>
   She even bought you "some pimp Versace gear"?
   <br>
   <br>
   Nice!
   <br>
   <br>
   OK, you say that you've read my book, but you must
   <br>
   have missed page 62. I explain exactly how to deal
   <br>
   with this kind of situation (questions you don't want
   <br>
   to answer).
   <br>
   <br>
   Here, let me get creative for you...
   <br>
   <br>
   She asks: "Are you a player?"
   <br>
   <br>
   You answer: "Are you trying to hide the fact that
   <br>
   YOU are?"
   <br>
   <br>
   One key in situations like this is to NEVER give a
   <br>
   woman a direct answer.
   <br>
   <br>
   Use your Cocky &amp; Funny skills to come up with 5 good
   <br>
   answers, and use them.
   <br>
   <br>
   Maybe say: "Yes, I play sports... what do you like?"
   <br>
   <br>
   As you can see, I like to turn questions and accusations
   <br>
   around and guess that they're trying to hide the fact
   <br>
   that what they're asking about is something wrong
   <br>
   with THEM.
   <br>
   <br>
   Just don't answer directly... and most women will
   <br>
   give up.
   <br>
   <br>
   If you get defensive and say "Oh, no no no... I'm
   <br>
   not a Player at all..." most women won't believe
   <br>
   you anyway - even if you're NOT a player.
  </br>
 </br>

 I think besides the falling in love part of course..it`s important to demystify the whole courting part a bit...you`ll feel more comfortable..more like yourself..and it avoids a whole lot of other difficulties..

Depends if you want a girlfriend or an agony aunt. I went out with a fella who didn't stop talking about his "issues" and how awful his life had been/was. I am quite a cheerful person, but he seriously did my head in. If your problems are that bad get a counselor, and when you are out with a girl just relax, be yourself and enjoy yourself. Smelling nice helps too.

Women are great, they are such fun to be with. The only guys I ever met that had a problem getting a date were guys who didn't like women. They were guys who liked to play really Macho. Ha ha, what a laugh. That's high school tosh. Or the guys that felt they had a need to hang around other guys who were perceived as macho, LOL.
<br>
<br>
Myself, by age 12, I could ride a horse like me and the animal were one. Plus, I learnt how to dance. I had no problem. Women love to move in unison. It's a sensual thing, they like to feel close to their man.
<br>

Women prefer a man who will take control.  It shows he has confidence and is

into her.  Lots of women get into relationships to boost their own ego (sound familar guys?).  Why do they spend a fortune on cute clothes and makeup intead of video games and the like?  Because they want a guy to like what they see and keep coming back for more!  They want a guy who won't just move on to the next girl because she was too busy to call back.  Plus girls often think that not calling back proves they have an interesting, busy life and are thus more desireable to other guys (hint, hint).

and a fortune on perfume,those high shoes(dont remember the name) make up etc etc?
<br>
<br>
well IMHO to be the center of attention.
<br>
<br>
like all the modern talk about women dressing some way to look "sexy" because it makes them feel good,to be honest i don't believe in that.
<br>
for me they do it to dunno get rich boyfriends hahaaha J/k
<br>
<br>
well for example one of my school mates,a brazilian girl,she's about 16 if i'm not mistaken and she dress like "modern" girls wear.tight pants,mini skirts,every day a new set of cloth etc etc and she told me that she wears like that because she wants to get an older boyfriend around 25-30 years old,with car,house and good job.
