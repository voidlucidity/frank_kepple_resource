So how long were you gone, for those of us who did not even notice? My guess is that it was before my return from a long absence.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Welcome back, I remember you, well, not so much you personally but your eye sticks in mind, lol, and the fact that we don't get many people from Israel reporting in. Say hello to the old place for me. Has been a long time since I stepped on the old hallowed ground.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Frank

Did you switch to a different name or is this the one you were using before? It is saying you have only been here about 7 months for some reason.

He he, Tom, I always loved that stone dry humour. It's like you take everyone's usual offering and you leave it in the desert for three months before placing it.
