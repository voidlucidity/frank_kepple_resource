Interesting article generally related to the subject of cancer treatment: -
<br>
<br>
'The Medical Monopoly
<br>
<br>
"The field of U.S. cancer care is organized around a medical monopoly that ensures a continuous flow of money to the pharmaceutical companies, medical technology firms, research institutes, and government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and quasi-public organizations such as the American Cancer Society (ACS)."---John Diamond, M.D., &amp; Lee Cowden, M.D.
<br>
<br>
"Insurance companies are cost plus providers which, have no incentive to reduce costs. They act as "gatekeeper" and for their role in the monopoly will not pay for any treatment which comes from outside the cartel. This nation is coming to understand this horror is a result of complacency as well as collusion between government agency, pharmaceutical interests and institutional medicine and its powerful financial influence over nearly every facet of the worldwide bureaucracy and mass media. "--Pixley
<br>
<br>
It is illegal for a homeopath, naturopath, herbalist etc to treat cancer in the UK (Cancer Act), or advertise any remedy for cancer. Only a medical doctor, an allopath, is allowed to treat cancer. This effectively makes it illegal to treat cancer with herbs. You can treat yourself but you can't legally use the advice of a herbal doctor. You can go into any hospital or surgery and get virtually free drug medicine, but if you want to treat your cancer with far cheaper herbs or nutrients you have to first find a doctor, assuming you even know about the alternatives (unlikely), and then pay him, along with all the medications.
<br>
<br>
"We KNOW the answer to cancer...Yet the authorities, in the form of the law of the land (UK), will not allow this book (The Good News On Cancer) to be promoted to lay persons.....it is not permitted that they can even be told where to find information that might help them. That has got to be democracy with a very small d......One eminent publisher...backed out as he feared he could be jailed for infringing the Cancer Act by offering the book to the public. Another...was deliberately pressured by an unnamed group after his medical reader (an M.D.), having checked the manuscript, leaked its contents to a confidential authority."---Dr Richards &amp; Frank Hourigan.
<br>
<br>
"The medical and scientific establishments have (largely through the fact that they have sold out to the enormously wealthy and powerful international pharmaceutical industry) obtained more or less complete control over politicians and the media.....advertisements for my book Food for Thought are still banned by Britain's Advertising Standards Authority because the book contains advice on what sort of diet to eat in order to reduce the chance of developing cancer.'

do you have osteopathic doctors in the UK?
<br>
<br>
They go to the same medical schools, prescribe medicine and perform surgery in the same way M.D.s can but see treatment differently. They are also trained in herbal medicine and other alternative forms of healthcare that regular M.D.s dont get. Its a growing field in the US but still not quite as accepted as your typical medical school doctor.

<section>
Fully agree! I could think of half a dozen technologies/ways of treating cancer that are many times more effective than chemotherapy, at the very least.
<br>
<br>
I find that anti-information-on-cancer thing suprising! My brother is a recently graduated doctor, and the hospital he works at has a large homoepathy ward, biggest in the country. Damn shame they dont use more effective stuff but hey.

Stephen: It's just weird. I don't know what to say. One day they'll look back and laugh, but it's the people who are suffering now that matters... and that's not funny.

All the best,

Yes, and even if you know about the alternatives, a lot of them are illegal, at least in the UK.

The sad fact is, all the natural goodness is now being stripped out of our foods in the interests of "public health".
