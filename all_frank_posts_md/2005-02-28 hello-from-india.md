<section>
I am from India (Bangalore city). I am happy to join this group and thank you all for giving me this opportunity. After reading rereading 'astral dynamics ' 3 years back, my progress in OBEs are good. I have also worked on many energy systems. For the past one year I have taken up obe seriously and hope to improve upon in fast progress learning further from this group. I am currently using Brainwave techniques also. At present my popular obe method is suneye technique.
