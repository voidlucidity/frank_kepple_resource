uh.. well i dont feel like making a new topic.. so i'll write it here =D
<br>
<br>
i quit my energy work and psi for a few months and just recently picked it back up to see if i still have the abiltiy, and i do..
<br>
but its been going haywire now. like, at random times i have this crazy strong electrokinesis abilty.. i shocked my mom like 20 times in a row and freaked her out, and i even fully charged my cell phone as it was about to die '_'
<br>
other weird stuffs been happening too.. like, whenever i make a wish it "half-way" happens.. lol i know its weird, but for example...my dad was taking me to gym and i said "i wish this car would crash and kill me" and just then the car starts skidding out of control while im laughing, lol.. but it didnt crash.. and a while ago i said "i wish i get tuberculosis and die from it" and i started coughing up blood '_' ive been dizzy as hell for weeks and getting pain in random places i literally try not to scream from.. but yeh... anyone have an idea of whats happening?

ok.. since no one knows anything about that.. does anyone know how to stop yourself from seeing spirits and to get rid of poltergeists? Â ive tried the light orb thingy method, and the drowning out the noise, and blah... none of it works.
