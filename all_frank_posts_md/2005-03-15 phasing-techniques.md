Hi:
<br>
<br>
There are no Phasing "techniques" as such. Phasing describes an approach that holds the promise of going
<i>
 beyond
</i>
methods and techniques. The approach works in tandem with the Noticing exercise I talk about briefly in the FAQ, which I expand upon greatly in my forthcoming book.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi:
<br>
<br>
No need to be, I'm sorry if my explanation made you feel that way. I just thought I'd give you a quick reply earlier to try and point you in the right direction, as I was a bit pushed for time, and in doing so I may have come across as a teeny bit harsh. This was not intended.
<br>
<br>
What I suggest is for you to have a good read through some of my posts, particularly over the past 4/5 months. Check out posts by Major Tom too, especially his Focus 10 thread in the Sticky Topic section. If you want to ask any questions then pop them in the Astral Consciousness forum and we'll all do our best to help you.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Frank
