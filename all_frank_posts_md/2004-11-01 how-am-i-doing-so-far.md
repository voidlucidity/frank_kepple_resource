Just recently I have been trying to project. I think I have really tried maybe 3 times. Anyway, each time it seems I am closer and closer than the last. SO let me guide you through what I have been doing and maybe you can help me out..
<br>
<br>
I lie down and being to flex and un flex every muscle in my body starting at feet. After doing that once or twice I close my eyes and Begin doing the breath exercises. I do this for a while then I begin my falling exercises. The thing with this is that sometimes I do it so well I think that my head sort of twitches for some reason? So at this point I am feeling quite heavy. After that I visualize all my chakras opening by picturing them sort of as a white pac man shape with there mouths opening. I draw energy into each one once. At that point my breathing and my heart rate has increased alot. SO I begin trying to leave my body. I try rope, I try sitting up, I try imagining myself in front of me, and I try just rising. I'm not sure if I got any were but It felt as if My head area was leaving. Although I'm thinking it was me just lifting my head a few inches off the bed.
<br>
<br>
The whole thing takes about 15mins. Maybe I'm not tranced enough? I still have other thoughts coming into my mind bout the day and etc.
<br>
<br>
Any help?

Something that doesn't sit right with me, you say your breathing and your heart-rate has

a lot? Was that a typo?

Yes, that when I'm doing the energy raising and opening my chakras.

Personally, I never do any energy-raising exercises or chakra opening of the kind Bob Bruce talks about in Astral Dynamics, for instance. I'm not saying it is the wrong thing to do, it's just that it is not my particular approach. Many people engage in this type of exercise and thoroughly enjoy it.
<br>
<br>
But as for obe work, the basic prerequisite for projection is a deep relaxation of the physical body. During which time your breathing and your heart-rate should fall significantly.

I've found that if I concentrate on my heart long enough it starts to feel like it's about ready to beat itself out of my chest. That kind of fits with the heart concentration method for projecting they give over on astralweb. The forceful beating sensation isn't your physical heart but something nonphysical that's in your heart area, maybe a pulsating chakra or something.

No I'm pretty sure its my heart. I put my two fingers to my jaw line to find my pulse and its matches the one in my chest. So is the supposed to not happen?

<section>
I'm ticked. I tried again just now..
<br>
<br>
I did the breath relaxation thing for about 35 minutes. Then I started on the mental falling thing. The whole time my heart was beating more because I was nervous, and my surface mind kept having thoughts about the day etc. I raised energy through my chakras once And I felt pretty physically relaxed and I started trying to get out. After a minute or so of that I felt that i was raising my body and tensing my arms so I stopped. What the hell am I doing wrong?
<br>
<br>
Please help

I feel ya.  I'm pretty much at the same stage you are at.  I think it has to do with lack of concentration and full relaxation (ie: the very basics).  As you "pull yourself" with ROPE, you tend to send very faint signals throughout your nervous system and eventually you find yourself slightly tensed or if you wait a long time, you find yourself completely tensed even though you were completely relaxed as you started.
<br>
<br>
The key I believe is to be able to think of an action without using any of the 5 senses (don't visualize it, don't smell it, don't feel it, don't hear it, don't taste it).  Some of theses are pretty easy, but visualizing and touching may not be that natural.
<br>
<br>
I find that the heartbeat often comes around when you feel a slight "lifting" sensation.  The heart doesn't actually beat faster (at least in my case) it is merely felt throughout my entire body.  I can feel it in my spine, eyebrows, chest, ...
<br>
<br>
Since I'm not an expert and nerve pretend to be one (especially in such material as metaphysics), I would suggest you take my writing as an opinion more than anything.

Heter: Although I never do any energy-work as people describe it, I did once get curious and went through a stage of energising various energy centres people call Chakras. When the heart-centre is activated it does give many sensations and one of them is a feeling like the physical heart is beating at a ridiculously fast rate. It is obviously not, of course, it just feels that way.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to clarify what you were saying because, if you did mean your actual physical heart
<i>
 increased
</i>
then it would appear you are doing something wrong. You also specifically mentioned your rate of breathing increased as well, which again sounded suspiciously like it was your physical heart that was beating faster, and not merely a sensation of exciting the heart-centre.
<br>
<br>
The basic prerequisite for projection is a deep relaxation of the physical body. During which time your breathing and your heart-rate should fall significantly. In fact, the physical body normally becomes so relaxed you lose all sensation of it.

I get a mixture of that. My body feels completely relaxed and at some point I can't even sense what direction I'm facing in or have trouble understanding my position. But then at the same time, I get anxious and nervous. How can I control my feelings and become completely relaxed?

Ah, then what you are facing are the typical kinds of fear sensations almost everyone feels at first. I guess everyone has to get around this or solve the problem in their own way. There is no hard and fast method.
<br>
<br>
Generally, overcoming the fear is usually the first big test people face. People tend to think learning this art is all to do with techniques. They believe the first challenge or goal is to find a technique that works to get them out of their body (as they would say) and – hey presto – they will be free to roam around to their hearts delight.
<br>
<br>
This works only in a tiny number of instances, perhaps a fraction of one percent. Nevertheless, like winning multi-millions on the lottery, it happens just often enough to keep the dream alive. Technique plays a part, admittedly, but only a minute one.
<br>
<br>
Fear is not something you deal with by attacking it. Doing that doesn't work. But it doesn't stop people trying, of course. Fighting fear only leads a person into having all kinds of mental dilemmas.
<br>
<br>
Put simply, fear is something you learn to think beyond.
<br>
<br>
Once you grasp the meaning of that statement, and you begin to know it and feel it to the extent where thinking that way becomes automatic; all the problems and manifestations associated with fear just fade away, and they never bother you anymore.
<br>

I agree with Frank on this one.  Your heart rate increase is likely due to fear.
<br>
<br>
And if not fear, then it's increasing because of anticipation.  It's like standing in front of someone, knowing that they are going to grab you from behind, and you don't know WHEN it's going to happen.....so you stay as still as possible, bracing yourself for this experience.
<br>
<br>
To me, that is the WRONG way to approach astral projection.  The key isn't to remain physically awake and aware.  This is why you are focused on the physical body and its condition.
<br>
<br>
Instead, try to relax yourself, slipping your focus away from the physical mumbo jumbo that accompanies our daily thoughts, and become aware of the non-physical things.  Become passively aware of shapes, colors, lights, and sounds that may jump out at you behind the darkness of your closed eyes.
<br>
<br>
You will start to SENSE, not see, these things.  We are used to SEEING with our physical eyes.  You will eventually SENSE the non-physical through your non-physical eyes.  Gosh, I sound so esoteric and 'out there!'  I guess it's harder for me to explain than it really is.
<br>
<br>
Just ask yourself during your relaxation phase, "Am I trying to physically see something in the darkness of my closed eyes?"  If you feel your physical eyes straining to see, then you're doing it wrong.  By relaxing your eyes behind your closed eyelids, you're heading in the right direction.  You're training yourself to start PERCEIVING things on a non-physical level, instead of relying on your physical faculties to look at something that isn't physically there.  That's a good start.

OK then. I will just try to completely forget about my body.
