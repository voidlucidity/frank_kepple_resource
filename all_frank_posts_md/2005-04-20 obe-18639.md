Read the FAQ's here.  Pick up Astral Dynamics.  Raise Energy as much as you can.  Meditate often.  Those helped me project.

I'm not sure what you mean by "actual obe". You obviously want to knowingly project your focus of awareness someplace other than the physical. But could you be a little more specific about what, exactly, you want to do?

<section>
Okay, first I think we should establish here what exactly it is you've tried.
<br>
<br>
What methods have you used?  What books have you read and what have they told you to do?
<br>
<br>
You said you want to see what others can?  What is it that they've seen and what is it that you want to see?
<br>
<br>
Secondly, you have "stick with it".  Too many people try, something doesn't work once and they just give up.  Also, you can't start trying for AP cold turkey.  You have to get some groundwork done first before you start taking off for the stars.  You need to learn all you can about it before you start.  It can take a long time to actually get solid results so you need dedication.  Once you get results though, it sure is worth all the trying.
<br>
<br>
May I suggest reading Robert Bruce's treatise on Astral Projection, if you're a beginner, which I'm guessing you are, he gives a lot of pointers that may be helpful to you and also discards some of the c*rap that's out there that you may find in books written by mystic and the whole "new age" types.
<br>
<br>
So, answer the questions above so we can know where you're at.

Cheers shzarnie,
<br>
well hmmm most of the books ive read i would have to say are from that new age catagory,  theyve mainly been gifts from a friend of mine. my memorys prity shocking so i cant really give you any names of books.  But i can tell you that ive done some meditation but i always end up getting frustrated cos i find it quite hard quietening all the rubish in my head :-b  ive also tried layin down and just relaxing everything, this one book said to imagine being on a big swing and swayin back and forth then in your mind just jump off at the top. but i dunno bout that ay.
<br>
<br>
The books ive read have all said that having a silent mind is important... do you think this is true?  and the whole vegetarian thing, if im eating meat would that hold me back in a way?
<br>
<br>
Id have to say that the things i would like to see would be mainly just other places id love to explore in this astral plane cos its sounds prity out there ay. well i hope this is enough info for you, and cheers for your words of advice its given a bit more drive ta keep on tryin ay

<section>
a quiet mind is almost as important as relaxation!  Relaxation comes #1, quiet mind comes #1.5   I have worked for about 2 years to develop my relaxation and quiet my mind and it is worth it for everyday living as well as astral projection.  I can keep a quiet mind for as long as I need to while in a trance, which I can attain at the drop of a hat in bed.  It IS hard work, dont get me wrong, and I send all my support to you, but keep at it.  Both aspects are utmost important to your success.

<section>
is it possible for anyone to achieve quiet mind, no matter what the insane pre0existing patterns of thought signify? because i'm one to consider my voice seperate from my thought, because thought doesn't have to even be complete to get the gist of some thought up point, at least ive fallen into a habbit of thoughts that make sense to me but i suppose wouldnt to anyone else

<section>
Don't worry too much about that silenced mind thing. I don't think anyone truly has completely quiet thoughts, I think they may reduce their inner dialog (talking to themselves). If you find your mind wandering, just bring it back. Don't get frustrated with it.
<br>
<br>
Other than that, desire and sticking with it are the only things I can recommend for sure. Thinking back to when I first tried, I didn't believe in this OBE stuff, but I wanted to know, and I kept trying. As far as techniques and whatever goes, I was horrible and confused, but I had experiences anyway just because I think I wanted it enough.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, don't get over-involved with techniques. Phasing is probably easiest, and I wish I'd started off that way now that I can look back. Lucid dreams also present a way, but they're not so common. Whatever the case, a lot of patience is required.

I'd read all the sections in this:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/?BoardID=65" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/?BoardID=65
</a>
<br>
<br>
That is the treatise that Shzarnie mentioned above.  It's a great start.  Will clear a few things up, help you better understand what folks are speaking of here on the forums, and it will give you a few methods to try (if i'm not mistaken... sometimes i get the online document confused with his books.)
<br>
<br>
I would also read and practice this:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/?BoardID=6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/?BoardID=6
</a>
<br>
(That is how to do the "energy raising" mentioned somewhere above.  That probably helped me out most of all.)
<br>
<br>
I agree with mactombs about not using techniques real heavily.  It wasn't until I gave astral projecting a rest, that I started having success.  I had stopped really trying for a week or two but remained interested and often thought about it (and continued energy raising).   I'd try everything out (and not just once)... but eventually you'll find something that works.   There are lots of different methods and ideas out there, even here on these forums (you'll see if you keep reading posts).  I'd say all are worth reading and considering... sort through it all with experience.
<br>
Good Luck.
<br>
<br>
Kyle
