<section>
I've been at this for over 3 years. I now get into the trance state easily after doing some energy work. Then I try to get to the "almost asleep" state, but it seems the slight vibrations sometimes come on before I'm at that hypnogogic state. Other times I get into the slumber state and then the vibrations begin. Regardless, I have learned not to try an exit technique until the vibrations come.
<br>
<br>
Now let me explain this exactly. Do you have to be in the "almost dream" state in order to have an OBE or can you be more conscious than that? Sometimes the vibrations are strong and I think, "Oh, I'm ready!" and try an exit technique to no avail. Should I try to get deeper into the hynogogic state before I try an exit technique? I find it quite difficult to get to that state every time because my mind still feels quite alert. I have to be somewhat sleepy as a prerequisite. Can someone explain the exact science behind the order of states for a successful projection based on the questions I've posed. Thank you in advance.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
There is no exact science and there is no particular necessity for any order of states. That doesn't stop people thinking that way, of course. :)
<br>
<br>
I'm not what you might call a fan of RTZ projection, but as a demonstration to myself, a few times I have projected in a traditional sense directly from the physical (no "trance state" or any other state) into the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
What this practice of RTZ projection actually entails is a particular kind of energy interaction between the yellow and purple energy centres. You need to be fairly relaxed, I suppose, so you can focus on the matter in hand. But if you set off the purple centre and let it throb away you'll feel a vibrational energy travel down your body and interact with the yellow centre. When you feel the two start to "talk to each other" then you'll find you can simply rollout of the physical.
<br>
<br>
When I say "talk to each other", after a short while there comes a point when you feel waves of a tingling, buzzing kind of energy travelling up and down your body. At which point you should feel incredibly light and airy, and feel "static electicity" type symptoms. You might hear a static kind of crackling or hissing and feel tingles and stuff. When I say you'll feel light and airy, it's like you are in a tiny boat bobbing up and down on the waves of an ocean. At which point you should be able to just roll to one side and "exit" into the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was always under the impression all the so-called "exit techniques" were designed to bring you to the point where you
<i>
 could
</i>
"exit". This is not the first time I've seen a post of late where I'm seeing evidence that people are beginning to think that some kind of technique is necessary
<i>
 in order to
</i>
"exit."
<br>
<br>
If you fire-off the two energy centres as I described then you'll simply plop out of your own accord. In answer to the question of, "How do I know when to exit?" The simple answer is: when you feel like you can. Once the requisite conditions have been met, there is no trying... it just happens.
<br>
<br>
You say you are feeling strong vibrations. So you have obviously set something off. I always used to tell people that once they are at the vibrational stage then they should be able to just rollout. But then I realised people who do "energy work" tend to get all manner of vibrations as a result. Not just the particular kind of vibrations that occur as a result of the energy interation between the yellow and the purple centres as I have described. Apart from setting off my heart centre for a bit of fun now and again, I never engage in any kind of specific "energy work".
<br>
<br>
A such, if I were you I'd try and find out what, exactly, you have energised in order to get the vibrations you are getting. Because you can try all the "exit techniques" in the world, but if you do not have the necessary centres energised and the requisite engagement between them, you will go nowhere unfortunately.
<br>
<br>
I feel too much emphasis is placed on
<i>
 techniques
</i>
these days. Problem with that is Astral Projection is an art, not a science. It's the difference between creating music using computer software and playing the actual instruments, painting your house and painting someone's portrait, that kind of thing.
<br>

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Which chakra/body location is associated with the "purple" energy center you mentioned and which is associated with the "yellow" energy center?  Very interesting post.

Ben:
<br>
<br>
He he, I tend to avoid the word "chakra" like I avoid bathing in sulphuric acid, lol. As there are just way too many belief constructs attached. That's why I tend to go by the colours. Purple is the one at the top of your head and the yellow is the one about between your breastbone and belly button.
<br>
<br>
MT:
<br>
<br>
I find that by concentrating attention to the area of the top of my head typically sets it off provided I'm feeling fairly relaxed. If it is slow in coming then I do some deep breathing
<i>
 out
</i>
exercises to try to relax my abdomen as much as possible and "open" the yellow centre, then I go back to the head again.
<br>
<br>
I say "open" the yellow centre because that's how it feels. It's like all the muscles in your abdomen have totally relaxed and a big hole has opened up in the middle of your belly, lol. When this happens I have to get on the head side of things quick, else I'll feel an energy rush upwards to my heart centre (green) which will set off that centre. Once that sets off then it ruins any projection attempt. Unless, of course, I actually want to set the green going (which I do now and again, as it's fun to do) in which case I work solely on the yellow and let the energy flood to the green. I can never set the green off directly for some reason. I always have to go yellow to green, but that's probably just me.
<br>
<br>
I feel the initial inklings of the purple most mornings just after I awake. But I can't always be bothered setting it going as it happens too often, and the novelty has worn off. But once I feel the start of it, depending on how "strong" it feels in the way it is pulsing, I might do some slow, deep breaths while concentrating on the top of my head. Doing that will increase the frequency of the pulses considerably. All the while this is happening I am totally in the physical, i.e. I'm not in any kind of "trance" at all.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you too must have sensed this before, but maybe you never associated the sensation with anything, or maybe you have.
<br>
<br>
Typically, I'll be lying down just thinking to myself and I'll feel a particular kind of stroking sensation that feels like it is coming inside my head. There is a light sound associated with it, almost like a gentle release of air sound at the same time as I feel the stroking. It is a
<u>
 very subtle sensation
</u>
and any kind of sudden movement, like if I turn around or sit up, it will immediately go away.
<br>
<br>
The feeling I first described on the forum not long after joining, saying it felt like someone was stroking my brain with a feather. Along with the stroking I hear a
<i>
 gentle
</i>
shooing sound. Like the sound of shhhew... shhhew... shhhew... that will repeat about every second or two. I used to relate this sensation to my old "cannonball exit" of years ago. This is where I'd get intense vibrations, and it felt like I was shot from a cannon from the physical and I'd land in the "astral" somewhere.
<br>
<br>
At the time I was working on trying to slow that exit process down to try and find out what was going on, exactly. In doing so I discovered that the vibrations began initially with the stroking sensation in my head.
<br>
<br>
Now, if I gently concentrate on the area of the top of my head and breathe very gently and deeply, the frequency of the stroking will increase to a definite pulsing, which feels exactly like my physical brain was contracting and releasing. But it's not, of course, but that is how it feels. Sometimes, I'd say about a third of the time, I'll "lose it". Which means the sensation will go away and I'll have to start again. As I say, at the beginning it is an ever so subtle sensation that needs a little "nurturing" to set it going.
<br>
<br>
Once it is going then it is fairly difficult to stop as it tends to take on a life of its own! The pulsing will turn into a high-pitched buzzing kind of high-frequency vibration and you will lose the ability to control your physical body. This is where you feel a definite interaction between the yellow and the purple.
<br>
<br>
At this stage I can still have my physical eyes open and view the dim light of the room. But I do tend to get visual overlays where I'll see the room with my physical eyes, and overlaid on that might be the view of the same room but from an RTZ perspective, with all the attendant visual distortions.
<br>
<br>
This is kinda freaky but a lot of fun, and reminds me of visual effects people have written about while under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs.
<br>
<br>
At some point I can choose to "let go" of the physical completely and "rollout" into the real-time zone. This last bit I only learnt to do fairly recently. My RTZ projections before (not that I'm really into doing them anyway) were performed from the technique of "coming back" from my holding-off at the Monroe F21 state, as I've mentioned before.
<br>
<br>
But now I found it's best to use my old cannonball exit, to a point, but concentrate on not letting the vibrations get too intense. Otherwise I end up shooting off again. But having my physical eyes open, for example, I feel keeps me more physically grounded and helps retain a higher degree of control.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Thanks for your thoughts. I will just keep at it and not worry too much about the order of things, just let things happen a bit more naturally than force an exit at the exact time.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the PM and for the kind comments. My advice would be to concentrate on what you have set-off that is causing you to feel vibrations. That is a very definite sign. When people are having longer-term problems I always try and find something in the range of feelings they are having that I can say, yep, that's a definite that should be worked on.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, ever so many people are caught in a situation where they keep trying and perhaps are getting sensations, but they don't know how far they are getting, i.e. are they close, about halfway, or nowhere near? Thing is, there are no actual roadsigns along the way. But I would concentrate more on what it is that is giving you those vibrations. Can you say any more about them? Are they all over, or just in your head, or...?
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
The vibrations are more like tingling, electric washes that filter throughout my whole body. Like a bathing in energy or a pulsing out. Sometimes they last longer but mostly it's only a few seconds and they are gone.

<section>
Okay, so more of a tingling electricity-type of feeling than actual vibrations.
<br>
<br>
When people speak of feeling vibrations it feels like your whole body is vibrating. Before I began developing my Phasing approach, for example, I used to feel vibrations that literally felt like I was sitting on a very unbalanced spin-dryer revolving at top speed.
<br>
<br>
Do you know, or can you tell where the
<i>
 source
</i>
of this tingling is? I know you say they filter through your whole body, but can you actually ascertain a source?
<br>
<br>
Problem is, as I have come across before, people who do "energy work" tend to get all manner of energy rushes and tingling sensations. So it gets a bit confusing trying to translate energetic impulses that are seemingly coming from here, there and everywhere, into some kind of helpful pointers towards projection. That's why I say for you to try and find the source. What you are describing sounds very much like your Yellow energy centre springing to life.
<br>
<br>
That tends to give a high-pitched vibration type of tingling, static-electricity kind of effect, especially around the frontal area of your body, but it can quickly spread downwards through your legs and at the same time, upwards into your chest like a kind of energy rush. You feel it travel through your neck too, which is a whacky feeling, lol.
<br>
<br>
Now, *if* it is your Yellow energy centre coming alive and the flame, so to speak, is blowing out after a few seconds... then this is almost certainly tension in the muscles of the abdomen; which could also be coupled to your breathing as, of course, the muscles of the abdomen should move in and out with the breath. So the two are quite connected. But all this is merely speculation as we don't yet know the actual source.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank,
<br>
<br>
I can't say there is a source. It just seems as though the vibrations or energy surges happen throughout my whole body, not in any particular spot. I'll keep at it and await actual earth shattering vibrations. Oh, what there is to look forward to in life!

" If you fire-off the two energy centres as I described then you'll simply plop out of your own accord."
<br>
<br>
----
<br>
<br>
In my case, I can always start sensations in my base/spine easier than anything, easier than energy work!
<br>
<br>
Hence, I would love if Frank would write a detailed essay for us newbies,
<br>
on the exact process in stimulation the Yellow &lt;-&gt; Purple connection.
<br>
<br>
I notice in diagrams these seem to be connected!
<br>
<br>
Please feel to expand into an essay Frank!  I've never ever heard of this technique before, as a way to project. It seems simpler than most, on the surface. In the sense focussed on two centures than the whole, body and following a big routine, which never seems to work. Thanks. Can Anybody add to this method?
