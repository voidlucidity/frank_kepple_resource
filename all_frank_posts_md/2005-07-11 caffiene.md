As the topic states, would caffeine affect trying to AP from the conscious state? (not in large amounts though and only once in awhile)
<br>
It would wake up the body a bit perhaps, but then again, your mind is much more aware and active which could help to focus maybe or keep the mind awake while the body falls asleep.
<br>
<br>
Idk, its a simple question but yet i don't know the answer - I'm guessing its 'no' but what do you guys think?

well, caffiene might make your mind active and aware, but usually after caffiene i find it incredibly hard to get into a trance state. actually im not sure if ive ever done it lol.
<br>
<br>
There might be a certain dose that could help, but for me its mostly a hinderance.

Avoid caffeine!
<br>
<br>
Never ever drink caffeine late during the day, and avoid it as much as possible at all other times.
<br>
<br>
I find in my own personal experiences and in things I've read that caffeine (and just about every other drug) really mess you up when it comes to things like astral projection, energy work, concentration... etc.
<br>
<br>
It's usually hard tell that there is a difference in how you feel when you have caffeine and when you don't, like I can fall asleep after drinking an entire two liter of mountain dew.  But it does help a lot to avoid caffeine.  The last couple months I've been avoiding it just during the late hours of the day, and now I have tons of lucid dreams (also better concentration, and overall I just feel happier).  Before I started avoiding caffeiene I had only two lucid dreams in my life.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I think this is one of those things that effect people one way and other people the other way and some people not at all. I used to drink tea and a couple of years ago I stopped and there was no difference at all to my abilities.
<br>
<br>
I have only drunk herbal tea since I have lived in France as you can't get the particular brand of leaf tea here that I used to drink in England. Anyhow, I happened to be shopping a couple of weeks ago in one of the supermarkets in town and they have a new "English shelf" where they have typically English products. Amazingly, there it was, my favourite brand of tea. The only one I would drink. So I bought some and have been enjoying several cups a day ever since. It has made not one scrap of difference to my projection ability.
<br>
<br>
What I do believe is the real danger with these mild social types of drugs is the cocktail effect that comes about when they are mixed with all manner of other drugs and toxic substances that people typically ingest.
<br>
<br>
Caffeine of course places a toxic-load on the body and, depending on the toxins a person is exposed to in addition, then caffeine may be the drug to tip a person over the edge, so to speak. In the sense of being the last straw that broke the camel's back. But in terms of the typical cocktail of highly toxic chemicals people (in western society particularly) typically ingest then I would think that a mild stimulant such as caffeine would be the least of our concerns. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I've stopped drinking any product with caffeine in it for almost 1.5months now and have not noticed any effects with projections. I would tend to think any kinda of drug that the body uses can hinder the projection then aid it. It could turn to a mental dependency 'I need this to project and its my crutch'. of course physical too..

<section>
I beleive it depends for each person also. Some ppl can drink caffiene/tea etc. and it does not have any effect on them whilst other people may be more affected by the same amount. Also, would it depend on the state of the mind to beleive that if caffiene is not good for you, then that will produce an effect.?

Isurrender,
<br>
<br>
Very true and everyone is different in this. I know when I drink caffeine my hands will actually shake and I'll be wound up. Its was VERY tough removing mountain dew, coke and other caffeine products from my everyday gig.
<br>
<br>
It would be good to see what ways caffeine could be put to use for oobe or not.
