Hi guys,
<br>
<br>
Here's something simple to try. Walk about your house with your head turned as far to the right (or the left) was possible. Walk straight ahead, dance, glide, turn about, but keep your head turned the whole time.
<br>
<br>
I find that when I'm OB, I feel like I'm walking/flying forward with my head turned sideways...

Funny you say that.
<br>
<br>
When Im deep in meditation.
<br>
I find that my head starts to turn by itself to the left..
<br>
But it FEELS, like I am looking FORWARD.
<br>
Its a most peculiar sensation.
<br>
<br>
And I dont understand why my head turns/tilts to the left....
<br>
<br>
Anyone else have sensations like that?

Here's another one:
<br>
<br>
Get a bunch of bath towels.
<br>
<br>
Stuff them in your washing machine, but make it unbalanced; i.e., fill up only one side of the machine.
<br>
<br>
Start the rinse/spin cycle.
<br>
<br>
Wait for spin cycle.  Make sure towels are still unbalanced in the machine.
<br>
<br>
Lay on top of machine and close your eyes . . .
<br>
<br>
<br>
And there you have the vibrations!  Now you know what to expect . . . . . . .

F A,
<br>
<br>
It happens to me too. It's not your physical head, but your ethereal one, I believe. You're beginning to get ready to enter the Real Time Zone. However, for a lot of people it takes several months to get past this point...
<br>
<br>
You're on the right track.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck,
