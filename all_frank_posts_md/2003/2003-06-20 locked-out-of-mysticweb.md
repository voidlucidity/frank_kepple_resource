Well I finally managed to tinkle off the "Master", aka.beezlebub at Mysticweb..LOL..They changed the password on me and didn't tell me the new one.  I guess my reluctance to bow down to the Master and telling other people about other sites that were much more open did it..[

] Just as well..I stopped reading the weekly emails a month ago. Just wanted to share..they really shouldn't be scared of me I am totally harmless..lol.

] I saw your referels in the Mysticweb forums. I wonder if anyone could tell us if they change the pass words often every year or is it just this course that they are jumpy  about.
<br>

Just from reading everyone's posts here, and on other threads, is enough to make me want to avoid "the master" [

Me thinks there are spies amoung us!  Funny thing this morning I checked my e-mail...and behold!  Week 8 has been sent to me (I never did get week 7) With a new password..Hmmmmmmmmmm... I use the same name every site I go to so I am quite easy to find..(on astral sites that is..other sites I am known as Naykyd)
<br>
<br>
Krome..LOL..bowing techniques!
<br>
<br>
GoingSlow... Maybe they sent you week 8 also with the new password?
<br>
<br>
Usually I would get the weekly session first thing every Friday. OK...come out come out where ever you are.  Will the real Mark aka beezlebub raise your hand..you have been found out..

Hi,

I did the astral course on the mystic web last year and about 8 weeks after it finished I couldn't access it. I too thought it was my browser but when i signed up for another course it worked fine
