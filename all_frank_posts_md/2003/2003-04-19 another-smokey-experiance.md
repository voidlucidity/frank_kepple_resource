<section>
Tuesday, April 15, 2003. Some where around 7am
<br>
<br>
I fell asleep in front of my computer again, no major suprise there. But I saw the odd smoke again. This is the third time. Unfortunately I was unable to hold the experiance and yet again woke up and looked around for something burning and yet again found nothing.
<br>
<br>
I am curious as to what this is and why I keep seeing it.
<br>
<br>
It is kind of a light smoke, like what would be produced by something smoldering. It floats and hangs, rising very slowly. I have never smelled anything or experianced any heat to go with this, so I dont think I am dreaming of a fire.
<br>
<br>
So far it has only happened when I am in my chair in front of my compuer. And in this, what ever you want to call it, that is the view that I have. Looking at my computer. But is usually brighter than it should be in my room.
<br>
<br>
Just thought I woud share and maybe get some feed back.

The only experience I have which is similar: is when I project into the RT zone and enter the Astral in a more traditional sense through some kind of entrance-structure (such as the one printed of the back cover of Astral Dynamics, for example) initially I travel through a thick grey fog with near-zero visability for what seems like about 3 to 5 seconds. At first the fog is dark grey and gets a progressively lighter grey as it becomes thinner. Then the fog clears completely at which point the entrance-structure can be seen. At a guess, the plane of the structure comes into view, with me, from about a 60 degree angle and in terms of distance away maybe around a thousand feet.

This may or may not be relevant to what you saw cainam_nazier.
<br>
On several occasions, while in a drowsy half-awake half-asleep (hypnagogic) state, I have clearly seen wavy lines of energy. This energy does not appear cloudy, it looks much like wavy lines of heat coming up off a hot asphalt or cement road on a summer day. The energy is especially prevalent around electronic equipment (computer and CD player) though it can also sometimes be seen along walls and floating in midair. [

I originally thought that it might be elecromagnetic energy but recently saw the energy in a field around people. I'm not sure what it is[?][?]

Frank,
<br>
<br>
What are some of the clues that you have projected into the RTZ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Greytraveller,
<br>
<br>
It some what makes sence because I have been sitting in front of my computer when this happens.  When this happens for you is there a change in the "normal" light at the location?  Brighter/Darker?  Do these waves create any light?

At first, one of the most common situations was seeing views of the room from strange angles while my vision would be blurred.

Timeless,
<br>
<br>
No they never really took any shapes.  At most they would kinda stream up for a moment and then sorta...clump together.  As for color, there was none except for what was created by varoius light sources.

<section>
The energy waves are usually seen in dark or semi-dark rooms. This makes me believe that the energy is Not heat waves as heat is usually seen in bright daylight (hot roads and desert sands, etc).
<br>
I dunno exactly what it is that I see[?] My theories include such possibilities as seeing the vague outlines (without color) of an aura (??), maybe catching sight of whispy-like ectoplasm (?), or seeing some sort of ethereal-type energy like Prana or Chi. Though I really don't have any solid idea of what it is I am partial to the idea of it being Prana because I occasionally practice Pranayama = breathing exercises.[

Greytraveller,
<br>
<br>
It kinda fits, as I spend most of my time in the dark.  I usually only have the monitor or my black light on, and I got the windows covered in my room/cave.
