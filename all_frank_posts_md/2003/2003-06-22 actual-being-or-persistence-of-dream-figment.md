Hi guys,
<br>
<br>
I haven't been here in awhile cuz I've been busy with things going on in my life, spending time with my new boyfriend, etc.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd like to share this story and hear your feedback.

<br>
This morning, I head a dream which consisted of many different events. At one point, I was in my room conversing with a man/male being about astral projection/OBE. He either had doubts about it or wanted to know more, so I said "here, let me show you." I then went out of my body and flew around my room a bit. All the sensations were there, including the rentry rush. After I went back in, I was still talking to the man, and went back into the dream phase. The rest of it was still an obvious dream, like the prior part. The only part that felt "real" was the OBE in my room.
<br>
<br>
Was I talking to a real being, or did I keep my dream memory with me when I went out and went back in? This ever happen to you guys?
<br>
<br>
Cheers,
</section>

That sounds really interesting. o_o; Projecting in and out of a dream...Didnt RB write about it in the book..? Sounds familiar...its very possible to go in and out of the same dream, like waking up and falling back asleep. o_o So why not with AP..? I bet you actually projected for a minute from your dream, since you had no doubts it could be done, and then came back [

The objective existence of the man you met can possibly be determined by deciding whether you experienced an OBE or a dream. What I mean to say is that if this man impressed you enough so that you Did project out of body then chances are that you were impressed Because it was an actual discarnate being.
<br>
If you experienced a dream and did not project then chances are that the man was only a dream character = a creation of your own mind Without any objective existance.      [?][?]

I recognize your experience very well. Most of my OBE's have happened while in a "dream-state". In these "dreams" I am often already somewhat lucid, which helps because then I am better able to recognize certain elements of the "dream". And then something happens which must obviously "catch my attention", because when this happens my awareness/level of consciousness hightens further. Because my awareness/consciousness hightens I become even better equipped to recognize what is going on in the "dream".
<br>
Many times my awareness was hightened in a "dream" because I was confronted with something which related to going or being OOB; for instance, I would come to a large bright red door (which was a part of the dream-setting I was in) - and this made me decide to open the door and go through it, gathering speed as I went through so that I could fly (= OOB). In one "dream" I was sitting somewhere (in an open space in the forest) with a group of people, talking with them about someone (a woman) who had "died". For some reason I decided that I should go and find this woman, but that I therefore had to go OOB (seeing as she was no longer physically alive). I said to the group: "I'll be right back", and then went OOB (I flew over them, could see the group of people still sitting there, I wandered as I was hovering over them if they could still see me now that I was OOB, and then I flew away). After having flown around for a bit (in the "ether") I returned to this group of people again, and indicated to them that I was back. (I didn't come across this woman by the way.)
<br>
<br>
I had the same questions about this kind of experience you do; where does the imagination (the "dream") stop and the OBE start? And is it realy an OBE when it takes place during a "dream"? After some time of thinking about this, and having had more experiences whereby I went OOB from a dream-state, I concluded that it could well be that the group of people I was talking with were real, and that their presence during my "dream" and the subject-matter we discussed spurred me on to actually go out of body, even though this took place within a "dream". They could have been people (entities) who'se intention it was to help me in my wish to learn about OBE's and gain experience with this. And what better way to learn to go OOB than from a dream-state?! It is less confronting and easier, because you are already more open to the astral-dimensions when you are asleep.
<br>
<br>
I have had quite a few other "dreams" in which I went OOB. It remains difficult to determine what is real in your "dreams" and which part is formed through your own imagination (your personal reality). This is something I am still trying to get better at. The more you are able to highten your awareness while dreaming, the more you will be able to recognize what is realy going on. And the more you will be able to experience (because you will be aware more frequently and more in control). But this, in my experience, is a very gradual process.
<br>
<br>
I feel that when you are in a "dream" in which you already possess a certain level of awareness (like the "dream" you described), it will be possible for you to pick up on "signs" which indicate that you can go out of body, and it will therefore also be possible for you to follow up on these "signs" and actually go OOB from the dream-state. I also think that the man in your dream could well be a real entity, who was with you in your dream-setting, and might have been there to talk to you about astral traveling and help you to go OOB.
<br>
It is my opinion that a dream can be a mix of fantasy/imagination and reality; whereby the fantasy part of the dream is your own creation (also real, but created by yourself and comprising of your own thoughts - for example things which have been on your mind lately, people who are important in your life, issues which need resolving, etc...) The reality part of the "dream" could in your case be the man who you were talking with. He could have decided to visit you while you were dreaming, because then you are in a different state of consciousness and are open to contact with him.
<br>
<br>
<u>
 PS
</u>
: Do you feel that you were able to learn something from the discussion you had with this man about astral traveling? This could indicate that the man in question talked to you about this for a reason...
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your interesting account!
<br>
Take care.

<section>
Hello everyone!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your replies. Good to see you all. I just signed on tonight, so I apologise for not getting back to you sooner.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your input, Mica. I feel the reason why the guy asked me about it was because he was curious and wanted to learn more. Perhaps he didn't understand his current plane of existence, and wanted clarification??? Maybe he recently passed away and didn't understand what was going on...or maybe he didn't realise that living humans could travel out of body. Whoever he was, he seemed pretty calm. Not distressed at all...I think he was at peace...just curious.

<br>
Sigh...I wish I could remember more of our conversation...the only thing I can add is that when I offered to demonstrate, he was like "no...that's OK" but I went and helped him out anyway.
