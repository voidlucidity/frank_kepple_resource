My parents often remind me that when I was very little I had two "imaginary friends": Peatock and Ceyton(of course I'm not sure of the spelling since I only knew the names as a child). I have no idea where those names came from either.[

] I have often wondered if they were just figments of my imagination or if they were real beings in some sense. The subject has always fascinated me though. Anyone else have "imaginary friends" during childhood? Do you think they were imaginary or real?

]Mmmm, mine was on the other end of a red toy telephone when I was a kid.  I can't remember much about the conversations I had, that is all lost through time and living.  The odd thing was though, there was really a voice on the other end, I can remember very clearly hearing it, and the phone itself was empty on the inside as you could turn it over and there was nothing but a plastic shell.  There was no phone in my home when I was little, my dad didn't have one installed until I was in my late teens.

Looking back, this is quite spooky[:O]

I was reading a book called "Love Beyond Life" just a few weeks ago and there was a story about a very small child who communicated with his deceased father on a toy telephone. This kid told his mother all of these details about the father that could not have been known. Apparently the father died before the child was even born. Toy phones (as well as real phones) seem to be a very common instrument used by the spirit world.

sounds like an episode of the twilight zone that i've seen.. just don't listen to them when they tell you to join them, i guess.
<br>
<br>
im not saying voltarrens only imagined hearing voices, it's possible and i wouldn't doubt it, but when i was 3 or 4 and used my imagination, it was so realistic that, thinking back, i can't tell reality from imagination.
<br>
<br>
for example, at a restaurant we used to go to, i would lift up a tile that was under the window and use it like a cubby, sticking stuff down inside of the wall. it worked like a door, and had a hinge and everything. like the lid to a big car ash tray, only leading to a cubby in the wall.
<br>
<br>
a few years ago we ate there again for the first time in years. the restaurant had not been worked on or changed in any way, besides maybe some different wall decorations, but to my surprise the tiles under the window were nailed down tightly. there were no hinges or anything, and there was just solid wood underneath. it was then that i realized that it was just my imagination when i had used to open and close them and use them as cubbies.
<br>
<br>
i wish i still had an imagination like that..

<br>
What we generally call our imagination works in two ways. The first is a kind of channel that connects to non-physical realms; the second operates in a more local sense where we can create fantasies and/or imagine different mental scenarios.
<br>
<br>
The former tends to get suppressed as we get older. So it is quite common for young children to have the ability to communicate through this channel to a greater or lesser extent. The influence of the parents normally determines whether the child will develop this ability, or whether they teach the child to grow out of it.
<br>
<br>
In modern-day society, parents generally get very worried when their offspring begin "hearing voices". So this innante ability is not normally something they wish to develop; prefering instead to have their offspring sent to various institutions, over a number of years, having them brainwashed into becoming financially productive members of the industrial-technological collective.

<br>
<br>
The second way of using the imagination remains effective, no doubt due to its use being actively promoted; as it comes in handy in all manner of circumstances and allows us to look-ahead in our thinking. In other words we imagine what would occur if this and that circumstance came about. However, people also tend to dismiss these mental scenarios as mere figments of the imagination. But they do actually exist somewhere or other within non-physical realms of reality, to various extents.
<br>
<br>
For example, people who have problems maintaining their mental/emotional balance tend to create all manner of "figments of their imagination" on the lower realms. Unfortunately, when they project their conscious awareness within these places, they often meet these components head on.
<br>
<br>
Every thought we have ripples through layers of non-physical reality. Okay, what people choose to think is their business. But I do feel if people realised just how "real" their thoughts are, and just how far-reaching an impact they have, they would be mighty careful about what they thought about.
<br>
<br>
Everything is real within the realm of reality in which it is created.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Children Are more sensitive than juveniles and adults so they are able to see invisible beings such as ghosts. An episode of 'Beyond Belief, Fact or Fiction' comes readily to mind.
<br>
The young girl in this (True-Fact) story had an 'imaginary' friend. This disturbed her mother who encouraged the 7 or 8 year old girl to stop playing with that 'imaginary' friend. Then the 'imaginary' friend told the girl about some of the neighbor's best kept secrets (secrets that only the husband and wife neighbors could possibly have known). A 'real' ghostly friend or clairvoyance? The way in which the story was portrayed made it appear that the girl did indeed have an invisible (real) friend. [

<section>
a difference between an imaginary friend and an actual being? yes, there is. a figment of your imagination would be a creation of your own mind, while an actual being would not be.

THere are many possibilities when it comes to imaginary friends.  The first and most obvious is that they are erals beings spiritual or not. 2nd it could be a topa: a creation of the mind to provide comfort or some other form of human need. 3rd it could be an interdimensional being caused by overlaping dimensions. 4th it could just be a dillusion or a hallucination.  I added the last one because of my sister.  When my sister was young she had many imaginary friends.  I remember one that really annoyed me primarily because he would always interuppt our dinner.  My sister would say, "Pete has to use the restroom" or "Pete is scared".  So one day my sister was helping Pete "go potty" and I flushed the toilet.  I then told my sister that I flushed Pete down the toilet.  My sister got so mad and she cried alot.  She actually believes (to this very day) that I flushed Pete down the komode.
