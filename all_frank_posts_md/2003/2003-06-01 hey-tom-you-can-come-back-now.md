Tom c'mon back
<br>
<br>
I did not witness all that happened but I hate when anybody feels chased off a site because of some unfortunate circumstances and ill-used words. Everyone has contributions to make.
<br>
<br>
Let's begin again.

 I've been living to see you.
 <br>
 Dying to see you, but it shouldn't be like this.
 <br>
 This was unexpected,
 <br>
 What do I do now?
 <br>
 Could we start again please?
 <br>
 Could we start again?I've been very hopeful, so far.
 <br>
 Now for the first time,
 <br>
 I think we're going wrong.
 <br>
 Hurry up and tell me,
 <br>
 This is just a dream.
 <br>
 Oh could we start again please?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 <br>
 I think you've made your point now.
 <br>
 You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home.
 <br>
 Before it gets too frightening,
 <br>
 We ought to call a halt,
 <br>
 So could we start again please?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 Could we start again?Wish I could reassure you,
 <br>
 Wish I could talk to you and tell you how I feel.
 <br>
 I've been very careless,
 <br>
 This I don't deny,
 <br>
 But could we start again please?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 You surely know I love you,
 <br>
 But something in me stands aside, and lets you slip away.
 <br>
 Perhaps that's what you wanted,
 <br>
 Perhaps I want that too.
 <br>
 Oh could we start again please?
 <br>
 Could we start again?
 <br>
 Could we start again please?

Dear Tom,
<br>
<br>
Yes, please feel free to come back.
<br>
<br>
Heck, Nerezza is getting all soft and poetic....It's almost scary.
<br>
Nerezza is it because all that snow is gone?  Nice to get out of the cabin eh!  I know I sure felt like a new person when spring came a few weeks ago.  I don't care how big a Canadians house is.  After this winter my house felt like a tiny shack.
<br>
<br>
Regards,

I wish I could take the credit but it was the song I was listening to while I read the post[

<br>
Maybe I too should write a poem... ode to Tom.
<br>
<br>
A special man, our Tom sure is
<br>
With specialness that is so all his.
<br>
Blessed by God as a leader true
<br>
Tom relies on you-know-who.
<br>
His mustard seed of gentle faith
<br>
Momentous deeds will soon he make.
<br>
His many qualities are hard to state
<br>
Their number is so very great.
<br>
So I won't go into them all here
<br>
As it'll take me at least a year.
<br>
<br>
Er, quick pass the sick-bucket my way someone.

<section>
Geeetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I do not know exactly what transpired to cause Tom to disappear like this, except that it was a difference of opinion on some issues with other members. My view is that there has to be a diversity of opinion to create a discussion.
<br>
<br>
I agree that Tom should be back here, so I will contact him and let him know he has been missed.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Aww... Tom's gone?
<br>
<br>
What happened?
<br>
<br>
He was such a smart guy, and always helping.
