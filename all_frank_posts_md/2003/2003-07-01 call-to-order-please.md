<br>
Dear all,
<br>
<br>
I've been a member of this BBS for a while. There have been certain events taking place of late that are getting out of hand. For the first time ever I am reading language which I would never expect to read. And I am no prude, believe me. But logging-on here, on a virtual daily basis, for over a year, has led me to expect a high standard of general posting and respectful debate.
<br>
<br>
This is a moderated forum. As such, could I respectfully suggest that anyone who has a "problem" with another member to use the PM system or speak to a moderator. Otherwise, all I can see happening is one of the moderators will step in and start barring people. In which case, I feel all of us will take a step backward.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I want to apologize for my outrageous behavior..It just rubbed me the wrong way. I was married to a very physically and mentally abusive man and it hit too close to home. So, I apologize again..I hope you accept it...please??
<br>
<br>
On a lighter note last night I read Robert monroe's "Journeys out of the body" good reading!  I am now starting to read "ultimate Journey"
<br>
I was quite fasinated by chater 6 REVERSE IMAGE where he went into the hole...WOW!

<br>
Nay, you have my deepest respect and there is absolutely no need for you to apologise. It's just that things have taken a funny turn, of late. It was Inguma locking that post that hit home to me. That's just never happened (well, not to my knowledge) in all the times I logged-on, here.
<br>
<br>
I took it as a sign that things had gone too far... which they have, when you look back. My main concern is, if the situation continues, Adrian will simply bar whoever he feels should be barred. But we are all adults, here. As such, we should never let situations get
<u>
 so
</u>
out of hand that we have to impose on him to such an extent.
<br>
<br>
More importantly, if we did ever allow circumstances to get so out of hand that such was necessary... then we would *all* take a step backward.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, that's just my "2-cents" so anyone feel free to contribute.
<br>

<section>
Hi Frank
<br>
<br>
Your call to order was a good idea until Silva started deciding to take shots again.  Sweet innocent Silva "Oh Poor me I haven't done anything wrong at all".  Frank Silva is the person who started everything.  Go to the thread that Injuma closed, and you will see that she just jumped into that forum, and started something with me for no reason at all whatsoever.  But she didn't do it on her own, she did it at her friend goingslow's request.  They have a small little group of people that like going around trying to bully people off of the forum.
<br>
<br>
Frank if someone tried to do something for their buddy on a forum by jumping onto another forum and start insulting somebody for no reason at all, how would you react or feel by a direct attack like that with the person calling you stupid and an idiot and other things, and you had never even talked to that person on the forum before.  You didn't even know them from Adam, and they just want to pop up and start something for no reason at all.  What kind of a person is that.  Well Silva is that person.
<br>
<br>
I originally got on this web page looking for answers to help people, and since I've been here I've encountered a lot of nice helpful people.  But I've also encountered these small groups of 2 to 3 people who like to cause problems on the forums, and are not on the forums really to learn or find things out, but just to play around.
<br>
<br>
Look at the thread that Inguma closed out, and just see what Silva did.  What I said to her on that thread was totally in self-defense. About 3 bullies on that thread and on other forums have been following my topics around and causing me trouble.  I had finally had enough.
<br>
<br>
If you read some of those people's threads on the site that Inguma closed, you will see that those people were not wishing me will, nor were they wishing me anykind of long life, nor were they wishing me good luck in this life, the next life, or any other life.
<br>
<br>
I just said the same things back to them, and by "Hell" maybe I mean more that I hope there is a prison where groups of bullies like that can maybe be restrained so they can't go out trying to bully others or just jump on a site and start things with someone for no reason at all.  Then after they do that they then go run to a moderator and say oh "poor sweet innocent me didn't do nothing" and look what this person said about me.  If that doesn't work and the moderator doesn't buy their story, then they will jump on some other forum topic like yours Frank and say "oh look at poor me, I'm sweet and innocent and haven't done anything wrong", and try to get you to buy into it Frank.
<br>
<br>
I'm all for one ready for all of these comments and attacks to come to an end right now.  But I'm not going to let a group of 3 bullies attack me, and think I won't say anything back to them in self-defense.
<br>
<br>
Also in reply to Silva's comments, she has edited that comment, I never called her a "filthy grump" she added that in herself, I guess to try to show how "sweet and innocent" she is.  But all one has to realize she is the culprit behind all of this is to look at the thread that Inguma closed out, where it clearly shows that she just jumped into a forum and started trying to insult someone for no reason at all.
<br>
<br>
I will admit that I finally go fed up with being attacked by goingslow, Silva, Alchimiste, and a couple of others in their group.  I sent each of them in there group a message, it was four messages, Silva has edited hers to try to get effect.  However my 4 messages is pale in comparison to their 30 or more slanderous replies and attacks on me on my topics, that they had nothing beneficial to say about, and also would not stay away from.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping the moderator will issue a statement to all parties involved that they are no longer allowed to post any replies on any topics created by the parties in conflict.  And I also hope the moderator will make it where he says not to post and replies or send anymore e-mails between the parties either by a statement, or by just blocking the e-mail systems of the parties.  Because I for one do not want to get anymore replies or anymore e-mails from any in that small group of bullies.
<br>
<br>
Frank always remember there are two sides to a story, and that truth is the truth even when it's in the minority as ghandi has said.
<br>
<br>
Frank you were right to do a call of order, but Silva was wrong to try to stir everything up again, especially since she is the culprit behind it from the very beginning.  But even though that is the case it doesn't mean everyone should turn on Silva, because it was one of her supposedly friends that talked her into doing it.  What needs to be done and said needs to be said to her friend, Silva, and everybody, that for now on we treat all new members with respect, and we seek to say things on the forum that help others and gathers information, rather than trying to attack and slander others because we either disagree with their beliefs, or we don't like them because they are not in our little tight group.
<br>
<br>
I for one apologize to you Frank, and to the others who were professional and respectful enough not to jump in and make things worse between the parties in conflict.  To all those people I apologize.  But it's hard to apologize to someone like the small group that I mentioned to you, who I never wanted to fight with to begin with and they just started things with me.  I don't know if there can be any reconcillation between me and them.  If they apologized to me for everything they said to me and tried to start with me, then I could probably apologize to them.  Already though it has gotten to a point that even if me and those certain people apologized to each other, a rift has been created between me and those people, which might be okay to be there as long as we didn't have to much communication on the forums.  In other words it would be difficult to have any good feelings toward each other after every thing that has been said and done.  I guess a beginning point would be if all the parties involved went back and deleted all the non-beneficial posts that were made by them which would not aid in anykind of professional and respectful interactions on the forums.  I would probably be willing to do that, as to leave all those posts and replies just invites more people reading them and possibly more arguments starting up, with people jumping in and not even knowing where everything began.  I think people on the forum have a right to defend themselves when attacked, and that right shouldn't be taken from anyone.  However, I think if all people on this forum will refrain from attacking others for no reasons at all, that there won't be anymore conflicts on the forum.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Summary Frank, you were right to make a call to order.  I hope that everybody on the forum will start acting in courteous and respectful ways toward others.

What right has he got to cause such offence. I use this forum for advice and do not expect to have to read such filth.

Mike, we are not youngsters. There's not two sides to this but many sides. Come on, buddy, since when was a complicated situation so cut and dried?
<br>
<br>
You say you are ready for these "attacks" to come to an end. But it takes courage to do that. Whichever way you look at it, people have taken offence, And it is up to you to deal with that. That's the thing about these forums.
<br>
<br>
Yes, maybe people do have friends who tell one another this and that. But such is only natural. Anyhow, if you wish to continue this conversation then please do so in private.

<section>
As you can see
<br>
<br>
Jacob is a prime example of what I'm talking about.  He enters a forum is not aware of what all has transpired, and based upon people posting non-beneficial replies on the forums, replies that the person posting it may have been the one that stirred everything up from the beginning, and then another fight or argument breaks out on the forum.
<br>
<br>
I'm not going to fight or argue with Jacob.  But the situation shows how if one person on the forum has pull with another person, and they don't like somebody else for whatever reason, they try to get as many people as they can to attack the one person and stir up a lot of stuff on the forums concerning that person, so that when a new person or someone else jumps on the forum, without having any idea of what has been going on or what has transpired, they jump into the atmosphere of conflict and argument that has already been created on that forum, not knowing who started everything to begin with or not, and the arguments and fighting continues.
<br>
<br>
That is why if anything is going to be worked out, it's beneficial for old non-productive posts to be deleted.  Otherwise you are going to have your Jacobs and a lot of others just coming in and stirring something up that has already settled down.
<br>
<br>
Frank again, you were right to call a call to order.  And you are right that once the moderators see that the forum members can't courteously and professionally interact with each other without someone starting something else with somebody for no reason at all.  Then the moderators or going to step in for the first time and do certain things, and once that first step has been done, the moderators will react much quicker next time with even minor things that they see could get out of hand, and when they originally felt the forum members could professionally interact amongst themselves, they will now think that is not the case.  If we want the moderators to think we can handle these situations on our own, then we need to realize we all maybe contributed our part, and act like adults and treat all new members with respect and helpfulness.

Jacob
<br>
<br>
what you fail to understand is that I originally got on this site looking for certain answers, and had beneficial topics on the forum.
<br>
<br>
Then a small tight nit groups started attacking with attempted invalidating comments for no reason at all.  Who is the more justified the person who first gets offended, or the person who gets offended because someone would dare defend themselves and say something back to them.
<br>
<br>
I got offended before any of these in the tight nit group did.  I actually got attacked and offended a couple of times before I finally started saying something, back or defending my self.  If that is called being mad, defending yourself, when someone tries to mess with you for no reason at all.  And sane means letting people walk all over you.  Then I would rather be mad under those definitions.
<br>
<br>
So you can say what you want Jacob, as you have not seen everything that has transpired.  But if anyone has been vindictive or hateful which started all these things, I'm not the one in first place under those terms.  I have always, with all intentions, had came on to the forums just to mind my own business, and to find out new information and to share knowledge with others.  I just got pushed to my limit by certain people, and I lost it.  And out of response I just wished that God would give them back everything they deserve.  There was no death threats, just a strong wishing that God would give them what they had coming to them. What God chooses to do or not to do is up to God, and if he does choose to do something who can question him for it, and who can hold others liable for it.  God defends the weak, those at a disadvantage, and the minority.
<br>
<br>
I just got pushed to my limit and lost it.  I apologize that there were people on this forum who could push me to my limit.  But there is one thing that is true in all of this, if there was anyone who was offended, I was the first to be, and the second to be.  Finally I started defending myself only to find that there were to many people in the tight nit group to defend myself against.  I probably had about as much as a chance as Spirit gurl did.  I think she is smart and has moved on to other forums and topics and has been able to avoid certain people all together.
<br>
<br>
have a good day

   I see that age has become a factor yet again.  If nobody is lying (which I don't see how that can happen), Frank, Nay, and negremoval are way older than the average age of people that come here.  These are the people that have experienced it all.

   As many people will learn in this world, people are people.  The phrase "civilized" has lost its vigor.  Civilized now has stooped to a new low.  Acting like people is also not a great way to characterize it.  People were designed to act on primal instincts, and we all still do.

She's BAAAAAAAACK . . . [}:)]
<br>
<br>
I must say.  I don't even want to read those nasty little passages.  I'll state my point in a general sense.
<br>
<br>
It's OK to call it like you see it.  For instance, statements like, "I think you are wrong,"  or "In my opinion you really need a visit to your psychiatrist immediately" are fair game.  These are opinions, and opinions are OK.  They are allowed to offend.
<br>
<br>
It is OK if you are offended by someone's opinions.  That's your right as a reader.  And it is okay to respond, "what you said just offended me."  It gives the offending individual a chance to clear up any misunderstandings and/or apologize.
<br>
<br>
[
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
!]WHAT IS NOT OKAY:   Aggessive, profane text intended to frighten, belittle, or obliterate other Astralpulse members.  It doesn't matter what the offending person did to offend you.  Remember, OFFENCE IS AN AFFECTATION ANYWAY . . . if you are feeling overly-offended by someone, you've got ego issues and need to spend more time on your personal development.
<br>
<br>
WHAT WILL GET YOU IN MORE TROUBLE THAN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE:  Statements to the effect that "God" is "on your side" and willing to smite your enemies.  You will be laughed off the boards.  By the way, laughing at people's inane posts is OK.  Embarrassment can be very educational.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank, for your call to order.  Astralpulse is the best forum I've ever been involved in, and I'd like all of us to keep high standards.  As the forum gets bigger and bigger, it's going to get more difficult - - - rather like herding cats.  I just hope the mature (I won't say old; maturity can hit at any age) individuals involved with this forum take on the responsibility of reigning in other people's post-pubescent ego-rants as much as possible.  It's either that, or slink of into the sunset, and THAT would be the biggest sin of all.

<section>
Well it looks like some are on this board sincerely knowing there needed to be a call to order, and others are on this board seeking to get one in for their friend who created the conflicts to begin with.
<br>
<br>
I won't mention any names.  But concerning whether or not someone can ever want God on their side.  I think it would be better to have God on yourside than the devil or negs.  And concerning if someone was under attack from someone, if God did happen to be on their side, and they did need help because of an outnumbered situation, whether meaning it or not they may ask God to help them with there enemies.  People ask Spirit guides all the time to help them combat their enemies, negs or anything else.  I think we should all go laugh at those people, because as we know, God nor spirit guides are never on anyone's side in a conflict, let alone will they go stop or smite some enemy or adversary who has chosen to engage in conduct that has harmful purposes for other entities.
<br>
<br>
the question is when God or spirit guides harm some entity or entities does it therefore make God or the spirit guides bad people because they sought to stop, harm, or imprison certain entities that were engaging in things that were not right.
<br>
<br>
Is force ever justified in stopping oppression, whether the force or words used by the person is meant by the person or not.  If those words can actually put an end to the oppression, and insure that those certain entities never do things like that again.  Maybe in the Bible God never really intends to send anyone to "hell" even though he may punish some, he just said what he did as a deterrant so that he could hopefully restrain entities with "free wills" from going out and messing with other people.
<br>
<br>
It's a contradiction to take shots at someone out of one side of one's mouth, and then to talk about we need to have high standards out of the other side of their mouth. If people have tough skin they don't need to be embarrased about something, if they feel they did what was right to stop some kind of a oppression.  Some people can deal with a situation one on one, but when they see others messing with others they won't speak up because they do not have the guts to confront a small nit group, who may be causing the problems.  I stood up for what I though was right to put an end to the abuse that sometimes happens to new members who just come on the forum to try to find help for something.  If it comes down to it actually, I bet you, everybody on this forum thinks God and spirit guides are on their side, and will help them if they are ever attacked by one harmful entity or a group of harmful entities, and will put a stop to those entities or imprison them, or whatever.  Maybe we should laugh everyone off of this board according to the logic of some people, because everyone holds those beliefs.  At least they hold to them until someone dares to say something to one of their friends, because their friend is out starting things with people for no reason at all.  In that situation those people don't care if there friend was in the wrong or not, they are going to attack the person that their friend is in conflict with even if it means they are attacking a good spiritual guide, a Holy Angel, a good person, or God himself. Their attitude is, "Let's show these new people that we run the forum, and they better not speak up when someone violates their rights".  That is the way some people are thinking.  It's only a small minority of people, but those people need to learn to quit doing that.
<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this, don't mess with other people and don't go around starting things with other people for no reason at all, and you have a good chance of being able to safely interact on this forum, except for those certain people who will start something with you whether you want to be a part of it or not.
<br>
<br>
But then again as some people think maybe we should be dressed to kill, and not just to maim.  I think such an attitude will not help a call to order.  I think any more response on this call to order should seriously address this issue, if anyone really is sincere about not stirring things up, and getting everything back to normal.

Dear neg removal5,
<br>
<br>
God cannot speak clearly to and through us until we clean up our innerself.
<br>
<br>
A person with a clean inner self does not pack baggage or have big hot buttons that can be pushed to cause reaction.  I do not care who started what or what you said.  All I see is you are still reacting. We all have work to do in this department.
<br>
<br>
As long as your inside has negative baggage you will attract and attack the same energy.  You will not be a clear conduit to the God you love.
<br>
<br>
All I see is a person reving themselves up and then burning themselves up in their own fumes.  Inner hatred, anger, bitterness from our past usually brings us to this point.  The important thing is to face this within ourselves. Then other people's actions or reactions will not bother us as much.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
I may have issues to deal with, but so do all people.  But you are talking to the wrong person.  You should be talking to the people who are going around taking shots at people and still trying to stir everything up.  Do you not think that people who take shots at people and go around stirring things up have any negative baggage?  Or do you think those people are crystal clean?  Why are you not addressing those people, when those people are the cores of the problem all together?
<br>
<br>
Which person do you think has the most negative baggage, the person who takes a shot at someone and starts something for no reason at all, or the person who doesn't like people trying to walk all over him and minds his own business most all the time but defends himself when attacked. Which of those people have the most baggage, and which of those people would someone who really cared about a situation address their comments to in order to find a solution to the problem or conflict.
<br>
<br>
If someone came up and physically attacked you, and I was close by, I wouldn't just say to you that you need to just quit reacting, and that by reacting you are showing negative baggage.  I would confront the other person instead and try to stop them so that they didn't harm you further.
<br>
<br>
I would not tell you that you are reving yourself up and buring yourself up in fumes.  Nor would I tell you that by reacting to the person that you are responding to your feelings of anger and hatred.  What I would do would be to analyze the situation, and try to determine who started what, and who was right and who was wrong.  If I thought that you were in the wrong even though you clearly showed that you did not want to be a part of the fight.  I guess I could sit back and address all my comments only to you and tell you not to react because it shows your inner baggage.  Or if I thought the other person or group was in the wrong, I would step and and immediately address them and help you.  If by chance you happened to injure your attacker by hitting him in the eye thereby saving your life, before I could get in and help you get him off.  I would still ask you if you were okay first, and get you help.  Only after first making sure you were okay, would I then seek to get the other person help who started it all in the first place.  I then would take him either to jail or the hospital.
<br>
<br>
But in no wise would I say to you just don't react because you are showing your inner baggage, and watch you get creamed.  I would address the attackers whether it was one or whether they were a bunch of friends attacking you.  And try to put a stop to it.  Becasue I would know that after I dealt with those people or attackers, there would no longer be a problem anymore anywhere, because you never wanted to be engaged in what you were in anyway, but in a way had no choice.
<br>
<br>
I really do not want your help in this situation, just like you would not want my help in a situation if all I was going to do was stand by and watch someone attach you, and say don't react because it shows your inner baggage.
<br>
<br>
If possible some of the other people on this forum who need help on inner baggage like the people making attacking comments might welcome your help.  You can check with them and see, if they want you to help them with their inner baggage.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I would just like to assure everyone that the type of thing that has been going on will not be tolerated.
<br>
<br>
We do not want to be seen to be supressing free speech etc., and indeed, until recently it was academic anyway, but with this number of members and increasing by a few hundred every month it was intevitable that some would come along and abuse the these forums.
<br>
<br>
We are on the verge of taking drastic action against certain member(s), and they know who they are.
<br>
<br>
My apologies to everyone else for having to tolerate this. We fully intend to return the forums back to their previous state ASAP.
<br>
<br>
I would also encourage everyone to send me a pm if you see anything unacceptable. It will be taken very seriously I assure you.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

A general point about negative situations: they exists by drawing more energy in to feed themselves, without this inflow they simply wither into nothing, fade and dissipate. In this case its people and posts.....
<br>
<br>
The situation can only be changed if all the parties involved change the negative to the positive (inflow -&gt; outflow again). Based on what has happened, and the state of things now, can anyone here really see this taking place? - everyone learning from their mistakes and moving on? Sometime people are not looking to learn, only disrupt. Feeding them more energy can never be constructive.

I'm sorry, Mike, but that is not the bottom line. The bottom line here is, if you keep switching into offensive-mode then you run the serious risk of being barred from posting further.

<section>
Frank there is no contradiction in what I said and what you said
<br>
<br>
I haven't been in the offensive-mode since I have been on this forum.  I have been jammed into a "defensive-mode", which I would prefer not to be there either. But I've been jammed in that mode only by a small tight nit group.  Most all the people on this forum have been nice and helpful, and I've had no problem freely interacting with those people.
<br>
<br>
As I said the bottom line is that people just mind their own business, and not going around starting things with people for no reason at all, and a person's interactions on the forum should go just fine, except for the few people who will attack you for no reason at all (the few people who stay in the offensive-mode all the time)
<br>
<br>
We said the exact same thing Frank, there were no contradictions in our terms (you're just playing with semantics), and I agree people should be barred from this forum that are only on here to play around and cause problems with other people for no reason at all.  However people in the "defensive mode" should not be barred.  The people that should be barred are the people who are always actively in the "offensive mode".  Once the "offensive mode" people are not all there in their tight little nit gangs or whatever, no one will ever have to be in a "defensive mode" again.
<br>
<br>
However those gangs in the "offensive mode" shouldn't be barred until they are first given a chance to know what they are doing to new members and current members is wrong, and are given the opportunity to stop their behavior all together, and begin mutually respectul dialogue.
<br>
<br>
Those in the offensive mode should be given a chance first, and if then one or more of them still like going after a sheep like a pack of wolves, then something should be done.  But they should first be given a chance to change their ways before that happens.

<section>
Frank
<br>
<br>
If those things were not important then why did we even bother saying them.
<br>
<br>
There are definately different subcultures on these forums.  There are the tight nit groups, some are nice and respectful, some are not. Amongst all the people on the forum there is a minority that should not be, but that is in the "offensive mode" concerning new members or people whose beliefs they disagree with.
<br>
<br>
Also profanity is not the only thing that people should work on, they also need to work on not calling other members stupid, all out idiots, ignorant, Pieces of ?, or whatever other terms that many of the "offensive mode" minority members like to use.  Along those lines they also need to refrain from trying to attack people until they finally push them to their limits.  We all have cussed every now and then when someone won't quit causing us problems, and pushes us to our limits.
<br>
<br>
My view on everything now is I'm just going to find people on the forums who are respectful and want to learn things and share information, and if a wolf happens to jump on that topic and start something with someone for no reason at all, I'm just going to e-mail a moderator.  I'm no longer going to try to use their own medicine to defend myself back.  I will just ignore their attack, and hope a moderator will deal with them if the moderator sees that they are on a particular forum not to be useful, but to just play around and cause problems.  That's my view of things from here on out.  I came on here to find beneficial information that I was looking for, I guess I had to learn how to wade through the different subcultures that are on the sites (even the ones that are looking to cause problems), and find the best method for dealing with those people who enjoy operating in the "offensive modes".

Do you see, my point exactly.
<br>
<br>
You can describe a person that jumps into a conversation like you and me are having, and says the things that you just saw the person say, as one of the people who are on this forum who enjoys always engaging in the "offensive mode".
<br>
<br>
There is a minority of people who whether because of maturity or some other reason like to cause things and act in a "offensive mode", even when someone is trying to engage in a serious or mutually respectful conversation.
<br>
<br>
However, I'm not going to report him to a moderator.  But I think you see my point.  I'm here to learn things, and I'm just going to find people who are interested in the same thing.

<section>
Frank
<br>
<br>
I never said that people of all ages weren't allowed to engage in conversations on the forum.
<br>
<br>
Our conversations has been about how to handle difficult situations that may sometimes occur on the forum, because of the interaction of "offensively mode" type people, who are usually in the minority.
<br>
<br>
I think in our conversation we found the answer to that question, but it did kind of help that while we were looking for the answer, we had an example of a person who engaged on the forums in a "offensive mode" posture, to shed light on our conversation and the answer.
<br>
<br>
Just as that person had a right to interact in our conversation, so do people on the forum who are looking for answers and information have a right to find the best way to defend themselves from "offensive mode" people who might come to their sites or forums to cause problems or take shots at other people.
<br>
<br>
From talking to you, I believe an answer that we can somewhat agree on is to report such an individual to a moderator if their behavior is going to keep being a source of problems.  The solution is not to give them their own medicine back, but to just let the moderators handle "offensive mode" people who just won't let up on new members or others who believe differently than them.  Another answer is to realize there are a lot of different subcultures, some that maybe aren't very nice, and just the awareness of that fact alone will help you not let people bother you or push you to your limits.
<br>
<br>
We all have things to work on, as again my only intent when coming to this forum was to gain information and share things with others.  I did not expect to encounter many of the things that I encounterd, and it has taken me a little bit to know how to properly respond to things going on that I saw were not right, and to not let those things affect me.

Dear Ronaldo,
<br>
<br>
How are you helping this situation?
<br>
<br>
There is always a bigger fish.  Perhaps I will play the bigger fish and ask you, "Why did you post the same boring, button-pushing dribble.  Then someone else will come along and ask me the same stupid question.  What a FUN game![
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>
]
<br>
<br>
We all have buttons Ronaldo. Some are easy to find because most of us have the same ones.  For example: We all want to be respected, we all want to be important.
<br>
<br>
It is one thing to stubble across a button and accidentally push it hard and react disproportionately when our buttons are pushed in return.  Another to intentionally push buttons.
<br>
<br>
The only solution is to not point the finger at others but to encourage self reflection.  We all need to self reflect more - you and I are included in that 'we'.
<br>
<br>
All you have suceeded in doing is once again encouraging NegRemoval5 to look at the stupid world around him AGAIN.  This will solve nothing.  We have to straighten out the world within before the stupid world outside starts making sense.  We start realizing we all suffer from the same root problems. INSECURITY spawns a desire to be right, a desire to defend ourselves to maintain our precious commodity -- our image of being respected.  INSECURITY also spawns a desire to look OR THINK we are better than the next guy -- so we can look IMPORTANT.  We cannot respect and understand others until we respect and know ourselves.  We cannot love others until we love ourselves.
<br>
<br>
Look within instead of pointing outside yourself.  You and I are no deeper or better than the next guy.  We just have different buttons with different degrees of response.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>

Hi Neg Removal5
<br>
I can see your point of view sometimes!... but I wouldn't keep it as it's a no win situation for all concerned. when I first posted I asked for replys defined by my own expectations..I imposed rules on others on what I wanted to hear and was a bit rude when it fell short. I learnt quickly that this was wrong of me and I was very lucky to get any replys at all. These forums are open for anyone to reply to so you can't get angery if someone jumps in with there opinion, if you want a private chat use the the option for it. I can see just from this thread that we are all going round in circles hence the no win out come. It's not wrong to express an opinion differing from others but it is tragic when confusion and ego clouds the mind. Wrong words were obviously used by ppl but there are no sides, we are all on the same side in laymans terms.
<br>
Getting back to your oringal post in hindsight you could have used the search option and read past post to answer many of your questions then implemented that knowledge and then posted for help with those experiences there by giving all concerned a clear path to grow in knowledge for the best possible out come. For whats it's worth I think we all have learnt something from all this but that 'something' is up to the indivdual to realise. IMO[

Hi Frank
<br>
<br>
I'm going to briefly respond to Ronaldo's comments.  Yes before when someone came at me for no reason at all in a totally inappropriate way, I gave them their exact same medicine back as a deterrant to leave others alone.  They attacked me for no reason at all and used strong words against me, and I used strong words back.
<br>
<br>
I was not like the people who attacked me, in that I'm the type person who believes you should mind your own business and not going around starting things with other people.  However there are people on this forum that do not hold the view that I have there, and me and a couple of those people clashed.
<br>
<br>
I made a mistake, I should have avoided the clash and handled it a different way.  Instead of giving them their medicine back and returning strong words for strong words, I should have just contacted a moderator instead before they were able to keep causing me problems to where I reached my limit.  Actually I'm a little concerned there, because I did do that, and no moderators responded to the one or two emails that I sent.  I think this situation is one in which we all will learn from even the moderators.  They should respond when someone sends an email for help before something gets out of hand.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to learn from my mistakes whether any of the other people involved who were attacking me choose to learn from their mistakes or not.  They might choose not to, and continue to go around starting things with people for no reason at all.
<br>
<br>
Now that I understand the forums a little bit better, I am going to use a different view and approach when I encounter people who want to cause problems. I'm going to choose to learn from my mistakes, and just not let certain people try to get to me anymore.

<section>
Timeless and Frank
<br>
<br>
I just realized something else, that one should consider.  The people on these forums are from many different countries.  Do you remember your comment about the French.  Well I guess maybe it's possible that the peoples of certain countries have certain tendencies in their behavior.  You can not apply it to all the citizens of that country, but as an overall picture certain people of certain countries may be known for certain things.  For example Ronaldo is from England.  I do not know much about the English people.  But I cannot always expect someone to be rational as I may see things through my American Culture, and expect them to try to be the type who wants to eventually resolve conflicts.  Maybe people of certain countries and cultures are known by certain habits throughout the world.  Maybe some people are known for striving on conflict or trying to stir conflict up.  I hope that is not the case, but it might be so, and may take a lot more work with certain people because of the cultures they are from.
<br>
<br>
If that is a case, then having an good understanding of the different cultures, may help you put things in a better perspective in not letting certain people get to you, by just realizing that is the behaviors of that culture in many areas of it, and that those people grew up in that culture, and may or may not have been influenced by certain aspects of that culture.  You won't be able to really know until you interact with them.  But I feel that even in situations where culture has affected someones personality in a way, that they still have the ability to change, and to learn from their mistakes if they choose to; However, there will be those who opt not to choose to.  It's their choice but we shouldn't let it affect us either way.

Dear ronaldo,
<br>
<br>
Why do you think you pointed the finger at NegRemoval5 at the end of your sentence?  Was it to get yourself off the hook?  Deflection (pointing the finger) is a common tactic to take the heat off ourselves so we do not have to look within. For some bizzare reason people are terrified of self reflection -- of seeing their faults.
<br>
<br>
Many people spend a lifetime pointing their finger so they do not have to look within.  Typically, that which we hate most in others, is what we hate most in ourselves.

Dear Negremoval5,
<br>
<br>
Culture does have an affect but I do not think it played any role in this situation.
<br>
<br>
The important things to understand are:
<br>
- We cannot change others
<br>
- We can only change ourselves
<br>
- We cannot expect others to change, that is their responsibility
<br>
- We can see ourselves (US) in THEM.  Anything we dislike about their behaviour likely stems from a flaw we have within.  Better to examine the flaw within then try to make them change.  If we fix the flaw then THEY will not bother us anymore because we will have gained wisdom and compassion for THEM. We realize we could do exactly the same silly thing if we did not know ourselves better.  Trying to change others and rationalize ourselves is an exercise in frustration and futility -- better to go the root inside with humility.

Dear Nay,

No Nay.  Kromeknight made it clear from the very beginning that he took no side.  However, it would seem odd to talk nicely to someone who insulted your friend.  I could see myself wanting to reasure the friend.  I did not say you wanted anyone to take your side.  However, you must admit when we feel insecure it is a relief when someone does.
<br>
<br>
Nay if there were no sides, there would not have been an arguement. Instead there would have been people helping each other take the scary step inwards to look deeper at what we all suffer from to some degree or other.

Dear ronaldo,

Why are you worried about what Negremoval thinks.  That is not the important question.  The important question is why are you still trying to deflect?

What is playing out here is an externalization of the war within all of us.  The same play will be repeated again and again and again.  Just in different forms with different players until finally we 'get it'.  The problem is within...not outside ourselves.

deja vu o.o.. i wasnt planning on replying but since i just had deja vu, oh well.
<br>
<br>
i think nay's right. you guys should try the chat room. the only thing this long topic is good for is cheaply racking up posts, which is getting in my way for world domination! er.. well, actually, yes, it is!
<br>
<br>
if everybody just stopped replying to this completely, maybe the problem would be solved. i don't think neg's gonna bring this up again in another topic unless he's provoked, so as long as no one provokes him, we're fine, right (wink wink..)? we can all learn our own lessons for ourselves. that would be easier and have more effect and meaning than being told what we should do or how our minds should work ideally, with all due respect to everyone here. i'm probably just talking out my butt, but, just a thought..
<br>
<br>
deja vu.. o.o

Kumbaya stuff aside anyone who believes God will smite people on a messageboard simply due to arguments has mental problems.  ~walks on eggshells and moseys out of here~.  I had to read how all this turned out *L*.  In actuality there are no hard feelings for me,it is all in fun.  I would still fear meeting a person like negremoval in a dark place,,especially if i stepped on his foot or gave him a reason to make me repent.

Dear Silva,
<br>
<br>
Why throw in a thorn if you are not going to talk it through and try to come to a greater understanding?  We are here to bring out the best in each other not the worst....aren't we?  Or are we here to externalize some dramatic play that is going on inside...perhaps in the hopes that if it is externalized we might actually figure it out.  That which we give is what we receive.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear No Leaf Clover and Nay,
<br>
<br>
Awww!  That was what was meant by chat. Sorry for misunderstanding. I have never been to the chatroom.  I will stop posting now.  Good luck too all.  My post count means nothing anyways....or it should mean nothing.

Man...this just goes to show how out of the loop I am.  I have to agree with Frank's original post and I echo his words when I say that I am by no means a prude but have been very disheartened by some of the foul language and utterly immature behavior by some members of the forum.

For the most part, however, the site is running as smooth as ever and I know I have a lot of friends and people willing to listen and lend advice here (or just chat).

Hello Lasher
<br>
yes it's a tricky situation, the more ppl try and work it out, help or even give there opinion the more frustrated and angry ppl get.
<br>
I had to laugh the other day as one of my old post came back to haunt me, you know what I mean it's good that ppl still reply because to them it's new, fresh but for me I've learnt from it and moved on. But for Neg Removal5 all this might keep coming back to bite him on the bum for years and nobody wants that do WE.
<br>
I'm not saying in regards to my old post that ppl shouldn't post there opinions, go for it! because new things can be learnt but if I said something 5 months ago my opinion might have changed contrary to my  original post, anyway I've said enough I wish all the best for Neg Removal5 and everyone else [

Hi everyone, I read everybodys posts and replies, nothing bad enough to report to a moderator.
<br>
<br>
Timeless
<br>
<br>
You are right about a lot of things in your post, but there is one area that might be off a little bit.  You said if a person fixes a flaw they won't bother you anymore.  I'm sorry that is not correct, even if you fix the flaw some of those people will keep trying to bother you no matter what.  I believe we have a couple of example up above.  I'm sure everyone can find the examples.
<br>
<br>
Kromeknight
<br>
<br>
No reason to worry about me buddie.  I have real tough skin.  Nothing haunts me or comes back to bite me for a time, if it does I just consider it a mosquito bite and swat it.  I could understand if people weren't use to certain people who like to stir things up, those people might continue to be bothered by those people, but I'm not.
<br>
<br>
I had to fight my way off the street a good time back.  I've had people try to rob me a couple of times. One time a guy pulled out a switchblade and tried to stick me in the stomach.  A police car came around the corner about 5 seconds later, and you know where that guy went.
<br>
<br>
I've also been robbed at gunpoint to the head.  It's not a very good feeling looking straight into a gun pointed at your head.  Since I wouldn't lie down on my stomach for them to shoot me, they decided to hit me in the face about 10 times.  I guess when they saw that I was a pretty tough guy, they decided to let me live.  Later when I talked to the police officer he was suprised that I wasn't all shook up.  I looked at him and said, "I hope I see those guys again, I'm going to offer to buy them another gun, because they can't hit worth a crap."
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've also had the opportunity to share in a number of fist fights during my sojourn on the street.  I started working for the van lines, and then eventuatlly got me a small moving business going.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Silva
<br>
<br>
You haven't said nothing bad enough to report to a moderator.
<br>
But in reply to your post, you better believe it, especially if you were going around and messing with and harming other people when I encountered you.  As long as you weren't doing anything like that you would be free to do as you chose.
<br>
<br>
I do get mental when I see injustice, as do a lot of good people including spirit guides, Angels, and God himself.  I get "mental" but the guy doing the harm to others is going to be the one having the "problems".
<br>
<br>
<br>
To all
<br>
<br>
I guess I have developed a "self-defense" mechanism whenever I encountered "belligerent", trouble making type people, who cause problems for other.  I guess my "self defense" mechanism is pretty strong, as I wish they would go to "hell" or "prison" or somewhere.  I guess some people are better at dealing with belligerent people than I am.  I for one agree that I have to work on the way I respond to such people, and I plan to do so.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes people are not themselves and react on the spur of the moment.  In those situations maybe they just aren't really thinking,  and they are not per say belligerant like that or troublemaking like that all the time.  It happens, they resolve the conflict, and then they move on.  But when you see the same people continue to do things and say things like that all the time, and they just continue and continue to act that way and try to take shots at others.  Then you have most likely run into a person who enjoys stirring up strife, being belligerent, and continuing to cause problems.
<br>
<br>
Nay went off.  I then went off.  She then refrained and apologized to forum members for her part and quit.  I then apologized to the forum members for my part and quit.  But there are other parties that were involved in the conflict who have chosen not to do what is right to resolve things and bring them back to normal. These others are wanting to continue to take the shots, and continue to stir it up, as seen from the posts above by certain people.
<br>
<br>
Everyone else can sort everything else out.  I've got some interesting subjects and topics that I have to go check on which are posted on the forums.  Hope to hear some interesting information on those subjects from some of you.
<br>
<br>
Good day all

<section>
Dear Negremoval5,
<br>
<br>
Sorry I was not clear in my explanation. I meant that even if they dog you it will not bother you.  Even if they try to push every button you ever had it will not bother you.  Because by then you have found all your buttons and understand why they set you off.  You will understand why silly things people do bother you so much.  You will realize just how silly some comments really are.
<br>
<br>
Try to ignore (not swat) people who are acting silly until you can disable as many of your buttons as possible. We can all be silly at one time or another -- making flippant comments or giving little jabs.  These jabs and comments are usually defense mechanisms born out of old wounds. You say something that seems harmless and then they associate what you have said with some horrible jackass they knew. You are not a jackass but with just one or two key trigger words they can suddenly imagine you are just like so and so who did this and this to me or my friend.  Brandishing an even bigger weapon will only make them remember a bigger wound and then bigger defense mechanisms will be pulled out.  When we start understanding these defenses inside ourselves we can start feeling more compassion for others as we watch their defense mechanisms in play...even as they are yelling at us.
<br>
<br>
People have strong reactions to different things.  Imagine someone who had a stern unloving strict minister as a father.  They might have a wild reaction to someone claiming to know God.  We do not know each others buttons only guess at them.  We can all accidentally step on a each others buttons and set off chain reactions.  Just try to be aware each person here is bringing in their own personal garbage.  Handling this requires patience and a cool head.
<br>
<br>
The great thing about this forum is you can work on ignoring silliness.  No one here can hold you at gunpoint fortunately.  There are no corners except a nice Writer's Corner -- so no reason to feel trapped.
<br>
<br>
I am so glad to here you want to work on developing new strategies to deal with others[

Timeless I see your point
<br>
<br>
Some of those people may choose not to do the right thing, and continue to try to bother someone, but even in that case the person should just ignore it and go on.
<br>
<br>
I also agree with you someone or some people stepped on my buttons when I was just on here minding my own business and trying to find information, and in self-defense I stepped back on their buttons, hence a chain reaction.
<br>
<br>
I think from this thread everyone can see that we all have areas to work on.  I for one plan to work on the areas that I need to work on, no matter what others may choose to do.  And in quoting you timeless, even if certain others do not choose to work on the areas they need to work on, we should not let it bother us, and just go on.
<br>
<br>
See all of you on the interesting topics out there.  I think we have reached the answers on this thread that we were looking to find.

<section>
OK it's obvious to me that all of my inane posts to the Chat section of this Forum are not going to send this string to the bottom of the heap.  RATS.  All that work typing for nothing!  Anyway, my little pinch of wisdom for the day:
<br>
<br>
Many moons ago, a high priest from a Scottish tradition told me, "All magic is done with mirrors."  It was a quote from someone else, I don't know whom.  An old Craft saying by now.
<br>
<br>
"All Magic is done with mirrors."  If you meditate on this phrase long enough you will realize, it's REAL deep. Everyone, write it on a piece of paper and stick it on a wall somewhere so you don't forget!
<br>
<br>
Most of the beings we interact with are actually holding mirrors up to us, so that we can see ourselves.  Sometimes we don't like what we see, and we strike at the mirror!  (Actually Timeless, we might have had this discussion before, because I'm getting flashbacks).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, one must work with the "mirrors" that are presented to us if we're to be successful at changing reality according to our wills, or changing our consciousness in accordance with our wills.  Sometimes looking into the mirror can be painful.  But we can't skip it - - - because ALL MAGIC IS DONE WITH MIRRORS - - - there is no other way to tranform your life.  So take a peek!

  Timeless I see your point
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of those people may choose not to do the right thing, and continue to try to bother someone, but even in that case the person should just ignore it and go on.
  <br>
  <br>
  I also agree with you someone or some people stepped on my buttons when I was just on here minding my own business and trying to find information, and in self-defense I stepped back on their buttons, hence a chain reaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  I think from this thread everyone can see that we all have areas to work on.  I for one plan to work on the areas that I need to work on, no matter what others may choose to do.  And in quoting you timeless, even if certain others do not choose to work on the areas they need to work on, we should not let it bother us, and just go on.
  <br>
  <br>
  See all of you on the interesting topics out there.  I think we have reached the answers on this thread that we were looking to find.

Before you judge others you should look within - one of the most important aspects for progress is to "know yourself".
<br>
<br>
Now please let this whole saga terminate right here and now.
