<br>
A woman was very distraught at the fact that she had not had a date or any sex in quite sometime. She was afraid she might have something wrong with her, so she decided to employ the medical expertise of a sex therapist.
<br>
<br>
Her doctor recommended that she go see Dr. Chang, the well known Chinese sex therapist. So she went to see him.
<br>
<br>
Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang immediately said, "Okay, now take off all your crose."
<br>
<br>
The woman did as she was told.
<br>
<br>
"Now, get down and craw reery reery fass to odder side of room."
<br>
<br>
Again, the woman did as she was instructed.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Chang then said, "OK, now craw reery reery fass back to me."
<br>
<br>
So she did.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Chang slowly shook his head and said, "Your probrem vewy bad, you haf Ed Zachary Disease, worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or dates."
<br>
<br>
Confused, the woman asked, "Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Ed Zachary Disease?"
<br>
<br>
Dr. Chang looked the woman in the eyes and replied, "Ed Zachary disease is when your face rook Ed Zachary rike your butt."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours,
