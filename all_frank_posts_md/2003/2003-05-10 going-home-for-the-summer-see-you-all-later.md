Hello everyone. I had a really good time this year and enjoyed the discussions I have had with you all, but unfortunately I must go back home for the summer and will not be on as often. I'll try to post occasionally though.
<br>
<br>
You are an intelligent group of people and it is beneficial in many ways to have discussions with you. I can't wait to come back in the fall so I can start posting again.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
<br>
Matt
