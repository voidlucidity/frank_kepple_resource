I have recently been interested in having an OBE. I have read a few texts and have decided that the ROPE method would be best for a beginner. I get to the vibrations but then my eyelids start to spaz and my concentration disappears as my eyes open. Can anyone help me?

The only consolation I have for you is to say what you are experiencing is very normal. At first, all kinds of unexpected events can occur which have the unwelcome effect of zapping you out of it. Problems specifically regarding the eyes are common.
<br>
<br>
When I began investigating the Monroe Phasing approach a while ago, for example, at Focus 12 it is common to percieve all kinds of abstract shapes and wispy foggy colours. For ages the moment I'd perceive some shape or other my physical eyes would immediately try and snatch a glance at whatever it was. Most frustrating. But overcoming these kinds of hurdles is often just a case of practice makes perfect.
