I have gone on whining and now i can stop! lol.  Last night, about 2am, took place what i believe was my-first-OBE!! Words are impossible to describe the intensity, exhilaration and the freakiness/scariness of the whole experience! Most of what i went through didnt completely abide by the protocol, but i am 99.9% it was an OBE:
<br>
<br>
i was lying on my side and had a strong intent on OBE'ing, but wasnt really trying hard. I was 1/4 asleep, and kept doing reality checks and WILD'ing.  Then it happened, all of a sudden i kept feeling what felt like goosebumps (energy?!) going up and down my whole body...started to tinkle me off a little lol.  But i remembered to keep calm and i then heard, what kinda sounded like a motor, maybe it was my fan, but my fan never sounded like this before. next thing i knew it i felt my head just stick out! i mean, just kinda nod forward and at that point i knew i was in an OBE.  My whole room was completely dark, but i could see pretty well, every detail i could see.  But i only looked at what was infront of me: my desk, computer, and monitor, all of which for some reason had (wicked hard to explain) blue flashes across them [:O]. I then got really scared, but knew there was nothing to be scared of, and opened my eyes...but the funny thing is that when i was looking at the desk, my eyes were closed and when i opened them (reality eyes) i woke up.
<br>
<br>
It was amazing! i had finally successfully OBE'd! After that i quickly wrote the whole experience down. Duration of the OBE was maybe 30 seconds (lol cuz i got scared).  Anyway, what kinda makes me doubt the OBE is that i never felt any "vibrations", and i kept expecting them.  If someone could answer that question, it would deeply relieve me.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading my Success and best of Luck to ALL of yall!!!!

Well done for the experience.
<br>
<br>
One of the "problems" people have to face up to when beginning to explore the non-physical, is the fact that these realms are populated by all manner of people. And once we become attuned to these realms, we naturally begin to perceive them.
<br>
<br>
It has got to the stage with me, that I have now got more non-physical friends than Physical. And I am by no means some kind of "loner". Quite the opposite, in fact.
<br>
<br>
Some people may try to "latch on" to you for one reason or another. It's normally because they are scared. I come across people all the time who have died, physically, and they have great problems dealing with it. Often, all it takes is a kind word to raise their understanding and off they go to some better place.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, at first, one of the BIG problems people have when dealing with these kinds of non-incarnates, is they have the tendency to project their fear onto you. But they don't really mean to do it. It's the only way they have of, "crying out for help" so to speak.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Confusion and fear are actually quite common during the first out of body projection. The way that most people get over this Fear Barrier is simply to experience those situations enough times to become comfortable and to stay calm.
<br>
Because confusion can turn to fear and that can lead to panic. And panic can end an OBE pretty quickly, Yet after experiencing a few out of bodys it is much easier to stay calm. Confusing situations are then less threatening and curiousity overcomes fear. That is when some very interesting things can happen. [8D]

First of all, congrats.  The first one is a wicked wierd experience (by the way, are you from MA?).  About wondering whether it was an obe or not, it probably was.  It seems that some people get only Vibrations, some get only buzzing while others get both.  It just depends on the person.

I have had a few OBE but I only have 2 confirmed ones that I knew were not lucid dreams.
<br>
<br>
I had one where I slipped out and fell down not realising I was obe. My other longer experience happened when I awoke OBE. Met a women and her children on the street. Not sure
<img alt=":-\" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/undecided.png" title="Undecided"/>
. Anyways, Im happy to hear you finally beleive 100% in OBE and experienced it. My first experience was weird as hell and while trying to fly, I remembered I have had OBEs in the past while asleep that I could barely remember. Anyway. Good luck
