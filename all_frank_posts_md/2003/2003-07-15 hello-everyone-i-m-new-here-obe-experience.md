<section>
Good Morning and hello to everyone here and a special hello to Robert Bruce. It was by chance alone that I wondered into the metaphysical store at the flea market last weekend and found his amazing book Astral Dynamics. I like everyone I presume has read and read book after book on astral travel, but none like this and I'm pleased to have found it (or did it find me?) and to be here in this forum with like minded people. My first experience was scary because at the moment I didn't understand what had happened until it was over.
<br>
" I always had a fascination with the stars, moon, etc. One nite as usual I was staring at the stars and wished I could just touch one, just once. I lifted my arm as if to reach for them but I noticed a bright light coming from the right side of me it kept getting brighter and brighter almost blinding. as I looked towards the source of this light to my amazement it was the moon! I was so close to it I was startled but not as much as when I looked and saw the Earth as big as basketball down below (I was at awe) I couldn't help it, I panicked and whosh I felt as I was dropped in my bed, I jumped out of bed shaking and realize that it was just a dream, or was it. While I was looking towards Earth I did notice a white string sorounded by a misty glow emanating from me (didn't notice from where in my body) and kinda wigly but I didn't see it comming from Earth (me down below)"
<br>
Well thats my story and to tell you the truth I don't like telling it to anyone. So I started reading on the subject but weary of trying again and as I said I didn't know what took place until it was over, now I wish I could've known how to handle such experience. I have also experienced sight with closed lids. I also had a dream where I saw myself with three kids and a cat, and when I saw me in this dream she(me) freaked out as if she really saw me, then I awoke. Years went by when I was in the kitchen feeding my three kids and a Himalayan cat and I saw a 'presence' staring at me, I screamed at it to leave me alone. I always had sight to these things and always knew how to deal with it, this is when I realized it was me and not a spirit(?). Anyhow, I'm taking too much space as it is. I'm pleased to be here and you don't know how good it is to get this off my chest.
<br>
Thank you guys for letting me be me.[

BM1209, have my warmest welcome to AstralPulse.
<br>
I quoted the above from your post to warn you that there're a lot of chintzy, niggardly, and finicky people here. Don't take me wrong, I love them all, however they tend to be a little fastidious treating the newcommers, and maybe your statement has ruffled some few feathers. Please take note that Robert Bruce is held here in extremely high regard, at the level of prophet, and to say 'you bumped into his book at a flee market by chance', is tantamount to heresy. Maybe you should also take note that all the scientific jargon used here to describe the various metaphysical and magical procedures is purely metaphorical, so don't make the mistake to fall into discussions concerning things like chakras, astraldynamics, uncertainty principles, preons, muons, and strange particles.

BW..Welcome to the forums..That is a wonderful account!  If I remember correctly, I think Robert Monroe had a similar experience.
<br>
(the one where you were in the kitchen) that is soooo incredible!
<br>
<br>
As for Mirador..tsk,tsk..I don't know what possesed you to say such things unless, you, yourself has gotten your "feathers ruffled"..[B)]
<br>
I have been reading your post lately and it seems YOU are trying to start some kind of conflict..[?]...please stop trying to scare the wonderful new people whom have chose to come to the forum!
<br>
<br>
BW..I hope you do not take Mirador's words to heart..search for yourself..there is plenty here!  P.S..I think chakra work is a great thing to learn..I have found it has helped in my OOBE's.
<br>
<br>
Nay. [

Welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
I had a similar experience myself when I "by chance" happened to come across Monroe's

 Journeys Out Of The Body
</i>
20-odd years ago. It was a major turning point for me.
<br>

Yours,

welcome to the forum BW1209 !
<br>
<br>
I've only had a few "OBE"'s....I've never noticed anything emanating from me, e.g. a silver cord...But I've read that it happens to others frequently !

Welcome here, the funny thing is that I also ticked at your "by chance" comment [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
] I don't believe anymore that things happen by chance. Many years ago I also found some great paranormal books at a flea market. The guy said he didnt need them anymore. Was so excited and it was very cheap, anyway... [

<br>
<br>
I also noticed your last remark "get this burden off my chest". I really hope you're not considering your wonderful experiences as something shameful or "bad". Here, on this forum, you are free to tell your experiences without having anyone make fun or laugh or raise brows so please feel at peace and relaxed [

Oh My!
<br>
I feel at home already, lol.
<br>
Thank you Mirador for pointing this out and for all who found my post offending please take a chill pill. It wasn't my intention to offend anyone. By chance I meant by 'chance' the last thing on my mind that day was buying another metaphysical book since I already have a mini library at home. Please allow me: Before we left the Flea Market I had a strong urge to go to the other side of the market towards a wiccan booth I hadn't noticed before so I entered and asked the owner for literature in Astral Travel, don't know why because I haven't thought about this subject in quite some time, most of what she had I had already read and lost interest in the urge when I saw Anne Rice-Vittorio The Vampire as I paid for my purchase I caught a glimpse of Robert Bruce's book Astral Dynamics it looked out of place because it was on the floor leaning against the shelf (
<img alt="Insert" border="0" height="15" icon:="" oops!="" speech="" src="images/icon_speech_oops.gif" width="29"/>
,did I do it
<br>
again?) I picked it up and my urge was elated (I call it my urge-intuition-guide) I'm wondering why since it looked like a complicated and heavy book, but I have learned to listen to this urge and paid for my two books, now if this wasn't chance then what else should I call it? But anyhow, sorry guys.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Nay for your kind words and thank you for having me here. I'm looking forward to reading up on all there is here, just wished I had taken that speed reading course, lol.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank. I have a lot to learn about OBE.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Clandestino. I just wish I could've taken a better look at it.
<br>
<br>
Thank you Starfox. I don't feel ashamed about the experience in itself it's wonderful. It's the feeling of not being able to share this with anyone in real life. I have  always felt at odd with other's because I see and sense things that are not 'Normal'. I do feel comfortable here relating my experiences with you all because we
<br>
know this is real and not imaginary.
<br>
<br>
Thank you all for welcoming me here in your forum.[

Mirador "all the scientific jargon used here to describe the various metaphysical and magical procedures is purely metaphorical, so don't make the mistake to fall into discussions concerning things like chakras, astraldynamics, uncertainty principles, preons, muons, and strange particles."
<br>
<br>
When I talk about that scientific stuff, I am not speaking metaphorical. I mean it literally. Some of it sounds too weird to be literal, but as most of us know the universe is a very weird place.
<br>
<br>
starfox "I don't believe anymore that things happen by chance."
<br>
<br>
Some things have a nonphysical cause (not chance), but why isnt flipping a coin only to see what happens random? Who would want to interfere with the coin?

<section>
I guess we all experienced the feeling of not being able to tell people of our "weird" experience
<br>
<br>
A suggestion could be writing down your experience in a diary (could it be computerized or traditional paper). Rob strongly advises to do so (although it takes discipline)
