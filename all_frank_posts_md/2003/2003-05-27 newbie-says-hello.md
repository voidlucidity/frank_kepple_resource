Hello friends,
<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd introduce myself and say Hello.
<br>
<br>
Been reading through a few posts and was advised by a friend to pick up Wave I which has arrived today - looking forward to getting involved tonight *waves at Marcus*
<br>
<br>
I'll let you know how I get on over the coming weeks - it's all a bit new and exciting really, having not gone any further than using meditation as 'still' relaxation.
<br>
<br>
Incidently, (and OT) has anyone here had experience of buddist Vipassana meditation - as I'm going on a 10 silent retreat soon and it's starting to scare the hell out of me

Take care y'awl and I feel free to mail me anytime.
<br>
<br>
Spencer Steel (yes, it is, honest)

   Tom enjoys reading up on the subjects, and he has mentioned that before. Unfortunately, he's been on an un-announced 3 week vacation... Â Maybe he'll come back some day.

Welcome to the forum. I did a weekend silent retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh back in the 90's and read a number of his books at the time. It was a good growth experience. Following that I gravitated over to Zen, sort of a cousin to Vipassana. They are all worthwhile, and building blocks of spiritual growth. Think of the retreat as another spiritual opportunity for you.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

I haven't been on here lately, so I figured I'd start out by saying hi to the new guys.

Gosh, Nay, thank you. I love a good chuckle. There's such good humour on this BBS.

All the very best to you.
