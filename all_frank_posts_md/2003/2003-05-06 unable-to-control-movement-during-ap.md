Last night I was attempting to AP, and at some point my astral body began moving around inside my body like it was on a roller coaster.  It was a very fast very twisted roller coaster.  I am sure that my astral body had somewhat broken free from my physical body, but I was unable to stop of even slow the movement, and I was not able to get away from my body either.  I was wondering if other people have had an experience like this, and if so do you have any suggestions?

I think I have something like that. It was during sleep paralysis state. I feel my conciousness become like a small ball and moving around my body with a high speed much like the twisted roller coster you described. To put it another way, I was orbiting my body at breakneck speed.
<br>
<br>
I can't really make it out what this means. Maybe this is some kind of training?

yesterday I tried to project and when I got several inches above my body, I started spinning in circles really fast before being snapped back into my body.  I thought maybe it was because I was still upset about something that happened earlier that day

Hey.
<br>
<br>
What exactly where you all doing to cause these expedriences? What meditation techniques, or separation techniques, etc. What order.
<br>
<br>
This is very interesting. Once while practicing the Mysticweb technique of focusing on my heartbeat while in a relaxed state (relax your body and then just concentrate on your heartbeat until separation happens), my astral head started shaking side to side on its own.
<br>
<br>
Please give the specific techniques that you use when you post. The more detailed the better. This helps everyone better understand projection and how to cause it, and helps people better answer your questions, and comment on your happenings.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>

About you question, I start out with a breathe focused meditation in my room just before I go to bed.  My room is completely black and after about 10-12 minutes I lose focus on my breathe and become aware of everything around me without thinking about it, it is all just there.  I am not sure how I make this transition, but it happens.  Once this starts I begin to feel like what you described my astral head begins to sway from side to side.  After a couple of minutes of this swaying my head becomes stationary, and I start to have a falling feeling like vertigo.  At some point during this falling it is like I land in a rollercoaster car without the impact, I don't feel like I run into anything but nevertheless the rollercoaster ride then starts.  Sometimes I remain in this rollercoaster like phase for upwards 30 minutes, but at some point the ride seems to stop and I begin to feel vibrations like I just got off of a real rollercoaster and the adrenaline is flowing like crazy.  This vibration subsides several minutes later at which time I always re-center myself and go to bed.

Training wheels? One of my first concious projections was similar, went through the process of seperation then found myself moving at a high rate of speed, this kept up for a few minutes and i felt like i came back to my body. I never did have any visuals during the journey.

The one where I speed in my body orbit is not induced actually. I'm basically in sleep paralysis state. But I've sort of found a way for me to experience floating/swaying sensation or inducing vibration.
<br>
<br>
I'm not that technique oriented. I don't even do them in specific order. Nevertheless there are something that I do most of the time and think would help.
<br>
<br>
What I found useful is to deeply relax yourself. Relax yourself, then when you think you are very relaxed, relax some more. To do this, no special technique is necessary. I found out that for me it help sometime to place my hands under the pillow supporting my head although this is not really good for your circulation. It only makes me relaxed more, in other word, the relaxation is more natural. Any position that feel comfortable to you. What I found most helpful is to relax from head to toe and not the other way around. No tense and relax technique either. I found out that it's better for me to just relax and let go. Also sometime I focus on the heartbeat just like you do but I also try to feel my pulse in any part of my body. My hand, feet, leg neck, ear, finger any part. This is actually from Sylvia Muldoon article on "how to induce incapacity" but I can't seem to find it now. You can try searching for it.
<br>
<br>
No energy work, meditation or anything when trying to project. What I do sometime is focusing on the blackness behind my eyelid and watching wake/sleep line. Doesn't matter if you do it in the broad daylight either. After some moment I will just lose awareness of my body and some parts of my body will float/move/sway. Sometime I will just float out. Also I found it helpful to concentrate on the point beatween my eye. The point where you see thing when you imagine them.
<br>
<br>
Also I don't found it necessary to do it all at the same time. The most important point is just relax, and let go. That's why I don't like rope much.[

<br>
<br>
It's better if you just forget of your body after relaxing it and just fall into the expanse of your mind.

LS: It's normal to experience fairly high-speed movement. For example, when travelling through portals, entering planes via entrance-structures, and so on. Learning how to control this movement is a skill which can take a while to develop.
<br>
<br>
Like with most aspects of AP, it all boils down to achieving a high degree of mental control. Problem is, one a circumstance is out of control it tends to remain

 uncontrollable
</i>
. At which point a person's protective sense of awareness will usually zap them back to Physical.

Frank: I think what LS is experiencing is more like around his physical body vicinity. Or did I get it wrong?

Hi, I'm new here but I know a little about Astral Projection.
<br>
I didn't know what it was at first when I first did it. I used to have seizures, and in the time I had them, I could see odd stuff and influence my dreams, because I was usually completely consious. I learned how to do it, but can only do it during the day and very rarely.

Terry B is right, it seems like I am still either in or near my body when I start experiencing the fast movements, but I have also thoughth that it could just feel that way because of duality, and my attention is more focused on my physical body than my astral body.  That is just one of the ideas I came up with.  I am not sure about what is going on, but it really doesn't matter to me, because I think that when I am ready I will finally have a successful AP, and besides it is fun to feel like I am zooming around (I am a thrill seeker).

Yeah . . . I get the roller-coaster-vertigo thing too.  It makes me want to barf.  The only way I can stop my distress is to tell myself that "it's all OK."  Then the feeling becomes less distressing.  Unfortunately it also tends to bring me back to the physical or put me to sleep.  Drat.  Not much luck with OBE lately.
