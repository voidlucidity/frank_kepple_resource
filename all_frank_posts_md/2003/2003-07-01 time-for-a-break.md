Hello Goingslow
<br>
All the best if you do take a break. Come back refreshed and full of expereinces to share, I'll miss your input.
<br>
I had to travel for a week, it  turned out to be only a couple of days (missed the little ones). I'm back now but in that time I missed out on so much. I sort of fill left behind as I try and catch up with verything. I hope this is not common...just me I guess but think about it anyway, your here and ppl know you...your apart of population. ppl  see your  nickname and would like to see what your've said...I do [
