Hey, last night I was trying to astral project, and when I was in the middle of doing it, I heard something moving in the room, so I looked at some news paper in the floor and it moved without any wind of any sort or anything to move it! I was freaked, so I sensed it and whatever it was put it's hand on my arm! I was so scared that I couldn't even think of the Lord's Prayer, so I asked God to give me a "Demon Killing" energy to put in my fist, and I punched it, it went away...... THE END! This is a true story of last night! Please tell me what was happening!

Just the usual kind of stuff that beginners tend to react towards. I call it the, "fish out of water effect." Under such circumstances a person's sense of awareness naturally tends to become polarised. With a little work, after a while this beginning phase can be overcome to the extent where it becomes possible to maintain a more neutral outlook, more and more of the time.

There is nothing to suggest that the entity you encountered was negative in any way. You may have bitten the hand that was trying to feed you. Try learn to overcome your fear or it will continue to be an obstacle for you.

Take care

No no no....... I had time to pray, I just couldn't remember the Lord Prayer. I prayed for God to give me like an energy to get rid of the thing.... As for the "You may have bitten the hand that tried to feed you" thing, I am fully ok with astral projection and stuff, I am just still trying to get used to these kinda things..... I mean, it isn't every day that a spirit grabs you....

Where did you come up with asking God for "Demon killing" energy to punch the "entity" away?  Sounds a little off the wall.

I am not used to this kinda stuff..... All I knew was that there was something moving stuff around in the house and it was grabbing me! I panicked and asked God for an energy to get rid of the thing! (Not so much of a "Demon Killing" energy)

I agree with Frank.  I reacted the same way with my first sighting of some man in my hallway, well, I didn't even have the sense to say any kinda of prayer I just screamed and kicked!! (and that is funny while in paralyzed state)
<br>
<br>
I can understand why you thought about a Demon, especially if you are into that kinda stuff.. I don't even watch scary movies anymore...don't need any of those thoughts running through my head while in Astral..!

Don't listen to them. People are not nice. Nature isn't either. Therefore, demons are not rare. Research "demon warfare."
<br>
<br>
Part of the purpose for a fighter to learn humility is in order not too be to smart to feel the punches coming. If you experience this by living your life right, your emotions will be consolidated. They are meant to be used for spiritual discernment.

ss_majin_gohan, you could have moved the newspaper by accident when you were trying to astral project, got scared and also created the arm that grabbed you. Its also possible it was a ghost, but you shouldnt attack a ghost just because its there.

pod, what you said reminds me of a book i once read about ninjas in japan. the ORIGINAL ninjas that took out whole japanese armies just by themselves.
<br>
<br>
the book was written by the first american to be accepted by the ninjas. the ninjas had a connection to nature that made them seem 'magical' to the more common citizens of japan, and even the national armies. when the american first wrote the ninjas asking to join them, the ninjas didnt even respond, because they knew he would show up either way. sure enough, he showed up right when they were expecting him.
<br>
<br>
the ninjas trained all day every day, taking a trip to a different region of japan each day. they never visited the same place twice, so that the ninja had to learn to adapt quickly to his/her surroundings. they wore clothing that made them almost invisible when used right. i even had trouble picking the ninjas out of the photos in the book sometimes, even though they were right in the center of the photo. they also used special hand gestures when coming face to face with opponents. these were thought to be magickal, and when a foe saw this, his confidence was destroyed, and that was the whole point.
<br>
<br>
and then there was their way of fighting people who had guns. this is where what pod says comes in. their way of fighting people with firearms was to *not* fight people with firearms; to avoid combat until a better situation came about. an example was shown to the american student: the head ninja called for one of his students to come sit in front of him, facing away. the head ninja took a sword, block of wood, etc., and stood behind the student, poised to strike. the student was facing away, and there was no way for him to see the head ninja. the head ninja did not make a single sound or movement until he striked. he built up a lot of rage, and very quickly yet silently forced the wood down towards the students head in a rage. the student calmly rolled over right before the block hit his head. when the american later asked the student how he knew when to move, he said he didnt really know. he just felt the negative energy, and sensed to move. the head ninja did this a second time, with another student. this time he waited even longer before striking. he stood building rage for what seemed like ages, and then, with no warning brought the block of wood back down towards his students head. again, the student calmly rolled aside before the block hit the ground.
<br>
<br>
the students had sensed the hit coming and avoided it. pretty neat. [

hehehehehe, the reason you couldn't see the ninjas in mr. Hayes' book is because they wore all black in a low quality black and white photos..... but ninja camoflauge is a useful tool, so useful that, I'm right behind you...lol
