Well, Im extremely knew to meditation, relaxation, energy raising, astral projection, etc.  I, being an engineer and a very scientific person, have had quite an interesting time swallowing all the what would seem "mystical info" that is obtained here and in Robert Bruce's book.
<br>
<br>
To me it has somewhat always been a question of whether the OOBE is just something concocted by the mind, is there empirical evidence that one truly leaves the body?
<br>
<br>
Im not knocking astral projection, in fact, I find it HIGHLY interesting.  I went out and bought Robert Bruce's book within 30 minutes of learning that it exsisted.  I read pretty much the whole thing, cover to cover, in one night.  I've also stumbled my way here, in search for other answers.  I have found a brain wave stimulation software package and presetes for F3-F27.  I assume these numbers indicate level of trance, or level of meditation and introspection.  What I did today when I tried to have an OOBE:  I started just the F27A from the presets posted by Adrian, I let them run for an hour while i worked on relaxing, clearing my head, concentrating, etc.  It is a suprising feeling, the first time in my life when my whole body goes numb and heavy and yet Im wide awake and thinking.  I believe at this point in a trance state.  Working hard to stimulate the energy in my body and in my brow center, although I dont quite "know or feel" how to do it yet, I just imagine it, and I can get to the heart beating very fast and hard stage, a point where I feel like I am floating right above my physical body.  I cannot however, project out, and If I am, Im not overcoming the mind-split.
<br>
<br>
Id like to hear comments, if any, and also I dont believe that there can be anything wrong with listening to F27 or even more stimulating low frequency binaural beats for any length of time.  Some people say, hey bud these are Theta range, dont go for longer than 15 mins.  Today, I did F27 for a straight hour, which to me only felt like 10 minutes.  There can't be any harm in that, because when I wake up, my brain should naturally restore and begin to function on whatever alertness is needed at the time.  Its a natural process.   However, I need some more expert opinion.  Again, thanks everyone.

John: Welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
I too am anything but a mystic. I'm an engineer turned scientist and first came across this topic after by chance reading Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body over 20 years ago. It was just sheer curiosity that got me reading the book when I happened to see it in a bookshop window. I figured the guy had either gone insane, or had stumbled onto something. So I put aside the tremendous tendency I had to think the former, and gave the latter a genuine try. Much to my surprise I began getting projection symptoms and I never looked back.
<br>
<br>
Problem was, when people like myself first started there were no groups such a these where we could all communicate and pass on hints and tips and so forth. So my progress was rather slow at first. You asked if the phenomenon is all to do with the mind. The answer to that is a resounding, yes. But I think what you are asking is the phenomenon merely something the physical brain concocts. In which case the answer is no (mind and brain are entirely different). Though I cannot provide you with independent proof of that fact. The best way is to discover for yourself and then decide.
<br>
<br>
Much has been written about this phenomenon over a great many years and it is all too easy to become sidetracked. But a good basic tip I give to people is that Astral Projection comes about by keeping your sense of conscious awareness awake, while you let your physical body just go to sleep as nomal. It's quite a tricky little mental balancing act to perform, and some are naturally better at it than others, but that is all you need basically do IMO.
<br>
<br>
The mental experiences people typically go through from attempting this have been isolated and labelled. Monroe (an engineer) was the pioneer in this work, so you might gain some benefit from studying the Monroe school. Bruce Moen (also an engineer) has taken Monroe's basic methods and simplified and modernised them yet further. So you may derive some benefit from his work also.
<br>
<br>
The other person I'd highly recommend, you already came across: Robert Bruce the author of Astral Dynamics. Robert takes a more traditional "obe" and "energy work" approach. These techniques generally lead you to having projections into what is known as the real-time zone. Where you typically end up looking down at your physical body whilst floating around your bedroom, etc. Whereas the other two are mainly concerned with projecting your conscious awareness into what are commonly called the Astral realms.
<br>
<br>
Within the Astral realms reside all manner of people in all kinds of circumstances, and it's quite fascinating being able to project within these places. You can sit and chat with these people, for example, in exactly the same way as you can on the Physical. (Well, those that are open to you that is.) You can discover other members of you Higher Self; visit the library within Focus 27; discover about your past lives, and so much else besides.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the greatest thing about discovering all this within yourself, is you finally begin to understand the reasons how all the mystical side of life came about. The difference today, however, is we have a very much more evolved sense of consciousness. Which gives us a big advantage when trying to work it out.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Greetings jfice!
<br>
<br>
Welcome to our forums!
<br>
<br>
I cannot really add much to the excellent words of Frank in response to your post.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to add this though. Many people are "guided" to the Astral Pulse for a reason. The beings of the higher/inner spheres, including your higher self, guides and higher beings including Masters, can influence people in physical incarnation by means of inspiration, intuition and many other ways and for reasons way, way beyond the scope of this post.
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say though, that the fact that you have found yourself here, and asking the questions you are asking, is all you need to know to pursue Astral projection, and the associated Spiritual issues of which there are many. I spent many years as a scientist before turning to technology, and I assure you that I, like yourself, Frank and everyone here am a very rational person.
<br>
<br>
You can be sure you are embarking on the most important thing in your current life, and that there are plenty of people here to assist you.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
