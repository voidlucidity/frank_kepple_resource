Hello folks!
<br>
<br>
First, I appologize for putting this message all over the
<br>
forum. But, it really is important enough for doing that.
<br>
I think you will find the below very interesting:
<br>
<br>
<br>
By using audio-technology, your brain can produce
<br>
large quantities of a given brainwave type. By sending
<br>
at tone of 200Hz into one ear, and a tone of 210 Hz
<br>
into the other ear, a part of your brain will start to
<br>
make 10 Hz brain waves, and then you whole brain will
<br>
start vibraiting in this pattern(among other, since
<br>
you have both beta, alpha, theta and delta frequency
<br>
in your brain, just of different amount).
<br>
<br>
<br>
Traditional meditators spend many hours a day in
<br>
many years, to be able to meditate in low delta. But,
<br>
using audio-technology, it is not your focusing that makes the
<br>
delta waves, but the stimulation from the sound technology!
<br>
You can even go deeper than zen-buddhist monks, but without the pracice! Traditional meditators are sceptic
<br>
to this possibility, but after trying it they are impressed!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Delta waves does something to you. It makes your brain
<br>
get more input than it can manage, which pushes your brain
<br>
to organize at a higher level. This development is very
<br>
beneficial, and makes you feel more one with the universe
<br>
(yes, it is a spiritutal development technology also),
<br>
makes you feel more content and happy, synchronizes your
<br>
brain, gives you more energy, increases mental ability,
<br>
clarity, intuition and psychic abilities, develops your energy body and more...
<br>
(Seems like a much easier way to develop your energy-body,
<br>
and can probably function as a great supplement to energy raising.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Centerpointe Research Institute was the first to discover the
<br>
importance of carrier frequency(if using 200Hz and 210Hz to
<br>
induce a 10 Hz brain wave state, then 200Hz is the carrier
<br>
frequency). Lowering carrier frequency increases input to the
<br>
brain. When the Centerpointe-people first started experimenting
<br>
with carrier frequency, they lowered the carrier frequency
<br>
substansially. At first they seemed to develop at very high
<br>
speed(which they kinda did), but after 5-6 days they got so
<br>
much input and physical, mentally and emotionally disturbance
<br>
that they were freaking out! The solution was to wait until
<br>
the brain had organized at a higher level with a certain carrier frequency, then lower the carrier frequency, wait until the brain
<br>
again had organized at higher level, then again lower the carrier
<br>
frequency, and so on. But from day one, you are in delta. The longer you stay in the program, the more you evolve(in fact, when getting longer into the program, people feels so great and has
<br>
achieved so much, that many continue the program just out of curiosity!),
<br>
but even in the beginning you evolve. I have used the program only for
<br>
a relatively small period of time, but have allready gone trough
<br>
positive changes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Centerpointe Research Insitute's Holosync Technology is the
<br>
best developing-program i have heard of, and if you would like
<br>
to read more about it and perhaps purchase it, I recommend that
<br>
you visit:

<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030526175350/http://www.centerpointe.com/" target="_blank">
 http://www.centerpointe.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you do buy it, you can mention my name, which is
<br>
"Tormod Krogh". If 10 people mention my name, I will
<br>
get my next level for free. You will not have to pay
<br>
more money by mentioning my name, but Centerpointe will
<br>
give the program to me as a "thank you" for telling people about the program. This wasn't my intention with
<br>
this message, which is to inform humans about this incredible
<br>
technology, but being a poor student, I(and my wallet)would
<br>
very much appreciate it if you mention my name "Tormod Krogh"
<br>
when perhaps buying the program, as a thanks for telling you about it!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Have fun!

Er, I'd hardly describe this sound stuff as a breakthrough. All this was started in the late 60's early 70's.

<section>
I am very sorry!
<br>
The tile of my message, BREAKTROUGH TECHNOLOGY,
<br>
was misleading.
<br>
<br>
The start of this technology was in 1972, I think,
<br>
when a guy called Gerald Oster found out that when
<br>
you send one tone of one frequency into one ear and
<br>
another tone of another frequency into another ear
<br>
(located on the other side of your head), the brain
<br>
starts producing large quantities of brain waves
<br>
with a frequency of the difference between the 2
<br>
frequencies(210Hz and 200Hz makes 10 Hz). It starts
<br>
in the olivary nucleus and spreads so your whole brain
<br>
resonates.
<br>
<br>
Robert Monroe of the Institute of Applied Science experimented
<br>
much with this technology, and I understand it so, that one
<br>
thing he did with it, was to get into a deep brain wave pattern
<br>
so he could have an OBE. The Centerpointe approach was available
<br>
to the public, trough their Holosync-technology(which they
<br>
have improved; they have also improoved their litterature)in 1989.
<br>
The Centerpointe approach is, as far as i know, uniqe with
<br>
their system of lowering carrier frequency. If there exists
<br>
other organizations which sells this technology, i would be
<br>
happy to know, but Centerpointe was the first that used this
<br>
system of lowering the carrier frequency, and I doubt that any
<br>
organization has a more professional way of dealing with this
<br>
technology, or that the litterature they send you is better,
<br>
more informative, more enlightening.
<br>
<br>
There are alot of sound tecnology out there, but technology
<br>
which creates auditory beat patterns in the brain, probably is
<br>
the most important.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in superlearning or the Tomatis Method,
<br>
I can tell you that Centerpointe will send you CD's which
<br>
with you can superlearn and enjoy the effects of the Tomatis
<br>
Method(high frequency sounds, bla bla).
<br>
<br>
Once again: I am sorry for calling it breaktrough technology.
<br>
I realize that it was a stupid title(though, maybe effective).
<br>
But, the important was that you read the message.
<br>
I will stop scribling now.

Hi Noradrenalin,
<br>
<br>
the "breakthrough" is a very natural, long known phenomena. The mind very easyly adapts to the hemi-sync signals and the carrier frequencies and the effects wear off. If you look at the Monroe hemi- sync frequencies, you can see that they use a very sophisticated setting to prevent this effect. To refer to a simple lowering of carrier frequencies as a  "breakthrough" is more a  "breakthrough" in marketing. The same counts for the free level if you win 10 new customers.  And of course this applies also for fact that you have to pay 159$ for each of the 12 following levels. Very high price I guess even for very good Brain Wave technology.
<br>
I hope it´s worth it!? By all the adrenaline you poured into this forum I guess, you are desperate for the next level?
<br>
<br>
Bye Helmut

How about this for a crazy idea? Let's all put our brains into generating large quantities of the Shuman Resonance brainwave frequency and then the global consciousness will connect itself![
<img alt=":P" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/tongue.png" title="Tongue"/>

<br>
<br>
<br>
N.B.-The Shuman Resonance is an electromagnetic frequency of about 8Hz(I think) that the planet constantly generates. Sort of ties into a global consciousness theory (I got it from Lain so if it's wrong then okay fine I didn't make it up [|)])

<section>
I didn't know the Monroe Institute used
<br>
special frequencies that doesn't make the
<br>
effects of the technology wear off, due to
<br>
adaption. Thanks for the information.

But, the effects are not the same.
<br>
I think Holosync is much better, and it
<br>
is not about the experience, but the effects
<br>
of the experience.

Hi Noradrenalin,
<br>
its difficult to judge a system from the outside and even more difficult to compair two systems you don`t know both by experience.
<br>
Let us know about your progress with holosync.
<br>
If you want my expertise on the holosync technic, send me some clips.wav from the holosync cds (2-4sec each) by e-mail and I can give you a detailed comparison of the two frequency technics used. I´ve done some research on the Hemi-sync frequencies, so it would be interesting to compair.
<br>
I am quite aware, that holosync also uses subliminals, but this is  another story.
<br>
<br>
Bye
<br>
Helmut

Hello Helmut!
<br>
Odd, your letter was so...friendly.
<br>
I feel so glad that I am a part of this community.
<br>
<br>
I am in a rush right now, but you can find
<br>
a demo of Holosync on
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.centerpointe.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.centerpointe.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
Don't think the demo takes you to delta, though.
