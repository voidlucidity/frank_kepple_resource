How's it going everybody?  I need your help.  I have been following RB's ROPE method.  I can get into a trance, and then I do my chakra work, but ROPE just doesn't seem to be working for me.  I can't get out of my damn body whenever I try to use the ROPE technique.  I was wondering if anybody could give me an easier method of projecting.  I appreciate the help.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,

Hey SBman,
<br>
<br>
Generally I'll meditate for a while by first breathing in 4, holding 2, exhaling 4, and then holding 2, repeat. Then I sit in trance for a while. I rarely ever miss these two steps. Then I relax in some way. Right now I tense and release and stretch my muscles, and I'm working on relaxing to the point that my body goes limp- really letting my body go, until the imagery comes, or I find myself in paralysis.
<br>
<br>
Then I would focus on the imagery until they drew me in and then I start to move as if I am moving physically, and be moving in my astral body. As of late I've been able to keep relaxing until the dream imagery comes, and after falling into a dream, or after realizing I am in astral paralysis, I can move, or relax more until I can move.
<br>
<br>
I'm still working on getting up and moving around. Any tips you can find, I appreciate it. [

<section>
Also...
<br>
<br>
You might want to use what I call a fixative while relaxing. It is something you can focus on while you body goes to sleep, so that you can remain aware, and eventally separate: counting over and over from 50-1, your heartbeat, your natural breathing pattern, the birds outside, etc. While doing any of these the visions, paralysis, ect. will come just the same.
<br>
<br>
Let me know how it goes.

The rope doesn't seem to do it for me either SBman. Right now I'm experimenting. I liked reading what Celestial Sounds said about "Then I would focus on the imagery until they drew me in and then I start to move as if I'm moving physically..."
<br>
<br>
I'm going to keep those tips in mind. Thanks,

Thanks a lot for the help you guys.  Also,  have one more question.  What do you think of the books
<u>
 Astral Travel for Begginers
</u>
by Richard Webster, and the book
<u>
 Astral Projection: Plain and Simple
</u>
by Osbourne Phillips?  Do you think that they have any useful advice?

SBman,
<br>
<br>
I haven't read those two books. However, if you click onto
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 amazon.com
</a>
then find those books, you will see reader reviews. Some books I'd recommend besides RB's are: Out of Body Experiences by Robert Peterson and Adventures Beyond the Body by William Buhlman.
<br>
Anyway, I'll keep subscribed to this post and see if others can tell us about the two books you're asking about.

Projection is not so much to do with techniques: it is a mental excercise which comes about from developing the right kind of mental understanding. The ROPE technique, in itself, cannot
<i>
 cause
</i>
you to project. It just serves as a little meta-physical imagery that can kickstart the natural process.
<br>
<br>
On the subject of mental understanding, from your tone, the thought crossed my mind you may be thinking too strongly along the lines of stepping out of your body. Problem being you cannot actually step "out" of your physical body. I know that's how it looks, and authors have written about Astral Projection along those lines in the past. But what you are actually doing is stepping out from within yourself. In other words, you are taking a step
<u>
 back
</u>
from the Physical not a step that is in some way "beyond" it.
<br>

along the lines of what frank said is that the purpose of the rope or any  technique(my favorite is the falling) is to generate an actual feeling of moving-this is like an actual physical sensation

im new and am trying to use the rope. I can get to when everything is fuzzy and vibrating, then my eyes twitch and my eyelids crack open a bit. I lose all concentration and im left with my ap form trapped in my physical body. I find this soooooo annoying to be so close yet so far[xx(]

Hi there dino333 !
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are doing pretty well ! If you are able to conciously bring about the "vibrations", you're not far off floating out of your body.
<br>
<br>
Whenever I've experienced these vibrations I've found it tricky to get out too....Like you, I've found myself in my astral body, but unable to move it out of sync with my physical body.
<br>
<br>
The key here (for me anyway) is to let things happen, don't try and force them. Once you feel the vibrations just accept that something is happening and that you don't need to actually do anything to help it along.
<br>
<br>
You'll find that you float up or roll out of your body. As this happens, you might try and interfere by concentrating on floating up, or moving further away. For me, this has the exact opposite effect - I end up back in my physical body ! Instead just relax and let it happen.
<br>
cheers
<br>
<br>
Mark

Why do some people always get vibration and some don't? It's quite rare for me. Those that I get is usually not very violent as some people explained and they rarely lead to OBE.
<br>
<br>
Usually an astral limb or two will just float while relaxing. Or my whole body just float or I'll just drag my non-physical body away. My body seem very hollow at that time. The funniest one would be where I keep falling from my bed left and right and absent mindedly keep climbing to my bed to continue projecting. It takes quite a while for my mind to grasp that I'm already out and should just walk away.
<br>
<br>
As for the easiest method is try to mimic sleep or what I call 'I'm going to sleep, I'm not going to sleep yet'. Just stay relaxed and when you think you're relaxed enough, relax some more. Also try to mantain your awareness so that you keep bouncing a littel bit on and off from sleep and wake.

I think the vibrations depend on a lot of things; one being how long you've OBE'd.
<br>
<br>
I remember around 5 years ago before I even heard of astral projection I'd be trying to fall asleep and start vibrating.  I even said outloud "holyshit im vibrating" of course at first i thought the bed was vibrating..  This happened for years.. but only about i'd say 7 months ago i found AD and this forum.. and strangely enough I dont get vibrations anymore at all; even the two times i consciously projected.
<br>
<br>
I personally think the symptoms such as vibration reduce in frequency over time.
