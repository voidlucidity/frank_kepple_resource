After about one month of intense practising, I finally had my first OBE about fifteen minutes ago.  I took a nap, and about an hour and a half after I fell I sleep I started to wake up.  Then I felt like the buzzing was going to start, so I decided to try to relax.  All of a sudden my teeth start to chatter like I was shivering and it scared me, so I stopped.  I thought for a second, this happens every time, so just let it.  Luckingly the buzzing came back and my teeth started chattering again, but this time I let them.  After awhile, the hynagogic imageary started to change, so I decided to try to sit up.  I did, and I felt kinda sluggish, and I opened my eyes.  I wasn't conviced that I had left my body, but then I started to fall lightly for no reason.  My vision went out w/out closing my eyes, so I knew I was probably projecting.  I thought about floating to the cieling and imediately I was floating, but I still couldn't see.  I wondered what my body looked like and then all of a sudden I was back in it.  It maybe lasted 15 to 30 seconds, but it was incredible.  Afterwords my vision was a little different b/c everything seems to flicker, especially this damn computer moniter.  Hopefully I'll be able to control myself a little better, but that'll probably get better w/ practice and hopefully I'll get more tonight.

Well done.
<br>
<br>
Please don't worry about lack of sight, this is a very common problem. So too is lack of control. You are right in thinking it will all come good with practice.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
