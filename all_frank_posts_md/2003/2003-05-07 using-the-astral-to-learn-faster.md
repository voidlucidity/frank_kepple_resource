i was wondering, this is prolly a stupid question but i have heard that time in the astral plane either is slower then regular physical time or time is just stopped. if this is true could we then use this advantage to learn things faster? like one evening could be like a week or more in the astral and we can learn something in one evening what would take a week in the physical plane.
<br>
<br>
this might seem far fetched but i was just wondering if it was possible.
<br>
<br>
thank you in advance.

I think it might be possible, but you would need some very good recognition abilities, which I know that I don't.  I mean after you finish projecting you will need to be able to recall all of the info in order for it to stick an longer than a few minutes.

Hey.
<br>
<br>
This would be easy actually. I've spend about 7 days and nights in the astral, in one 8 hour night here in the physical.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for such a good topic.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,

It is true that time can be distorted, but what you are really working toward is gaining more use of your time. It is not that you are looking for more time to use at the usual pace. Speed-reading and speed-learning courses are plentiful. They do not require astral projection or lucid dreaming. It is true, though, that practicing a skill on the astral or in a lucid dream can lead to better performance in the physical even without time dilation of any sort.

here's a related question: is it possible to directly send information from the astral (maybe the akashic records?)into your brain-like to learn a language or something instantly? I've read here somewhere that Tesla (the inventor) used to work on his inventions in the astral, then just write it all down in the physical!

<section>
Yes you are right about Tesla, he designed many of his inventions in the astral or atleast in his minds eye, but I think his understanding of astral world was much more advanced than many peoples here on this board.
<br>
<br>
I think that one could instantaniously learn something like you are suggesting, but I don't think that many peoples minds are developed or trained well enough to cope with so much information at one time.

What you dont realise is we already know everything, our bodies arnt evolved enough yet to be able to process our higher selves directly, that will likely take several more thousands or millions of years of physical human evolution - when we leave the confines of our body we're no longer trapped by the limited power of the human brain and can directly tap our higher selves more easily - to be able to do that will make you the wisest person alive therefore is not as simple as it may sound.

In the Matrix they learn things like that... it's a symbol for our upcoming jumps in consciousness. Their computer is the akashic records, and the astral planes are merging into the physical. We'll be able to download data like that and just "know" things. Soem kids can read a whole book word for word, without opening the front page. Kids these days just "know". It's going to be a crazy ride, so make sure you ride the wave!

   Here are a few questions to think about...
   <br>
   <br>
   1) What would you learn?
   <br>
   <br>
   2) How would you learn it?
   <br>
   <br>
   3) Where can I sign up?

Well I don't know about The Matrix being a prophetic symbol and I don't know much about this "fusion" between the astral and physical planes.
<br>
<br>
But yes, if this were possible, which I believe it is, that means people could learn martial arts faster[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]! I wouldn't fail math!
<br>
<br>
But of course you also need the physical strength. Which begs the question: Can people actually manipulate their muscle mass and strength by "meditating?" What I mean is - can people actually reduce or even skip muscle toning such as weight-lifting by using their mind and will power instead? I heard that loading the area you're working on with pure life energy and/or bio-energy (Chi) can make an excercise do about 30% more muscle development than the excercise by itself. That would be really cool if I could pull it off[|)]

There is no such thing as Time within non-physical realms. Plus, because there's no pressing need to earn a living to pay bills, and so forth, people there engage far more in all manner of recreational pursuits and/or fields of learning.
<br>
<br>
Individuals who are born with what people generally call a "talent" for something - whatever that talent may be - chances are have developed their skills within the 4th Density Exchange Territories (4D ET's)
<i>
 prior to becoming incarnate within the Physical
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Great sporting men and women, for example, within the Physical, will almost certainly have been great sporting men and women within the 4D ET's. It can even be the case that people choose to incarnate along the same timeline as their 4D competitors, so as to compete against them within 3D Physical.
<br>
<br>
The same appplies in many fields: renowned architects, engineers, scientists, musicians, chemists, and so forth, within 3D-Physical, chances are will have been renowned for their architecture, engineering, science, music, medicine, etc., within the 4D ET's. This is one of the big advantages of conquering the difficulties posed by the 4D environment, thus being able to live comfortably within this dimension.
<br>
<br>
The end goal of the whole process of enlightenment is learning how to operate equally comfortably and competently within multiple dimensions. The ability to do this brings a person ever greater degrees of freedom and a
<u>
 far
</u>
wider range of lifestyle choices.

   Thanks for answering my questions -.-
   <br>
   <br>
   What I was trying to get at is like to learn stuff, you need a source of information to give you the data. This in our world is a teacher or the internet. Think about it!

His inventions definitely suggest something like that. He had a handheld device that caused earthquakes big enough to bring down a skyscraper. He sent power with 99% efficiency 26 miles through open air, and we're still using wires.

I didn't realize his ideas were that advanced[8D]
<br>
does anyone know why his inventions/ideas haven't been fully accepted?
<br>
did he leave any detailied descriptions of how to go about creating his inventions?

   Look, think about it. SERIOUSLY. To learn, you have to have a source of information! That'd mean you're either going to have to invent or bring a teacher, or somehow hook up a Cable line on a computer in the astral. Otherwise, you aren't gonna learn much...
   <br>
   <br>
   That's just my advice..if anybody ever cares to read it...

Hi Squeek !
<br>
<br>
I have a funny feeling that there is no "cable" in the astral that you can just "plug-in" to find out information. Instead, your must use your mind.
<br>
<br>
You make a good point about having a teacher, though. A guide on the astral planes will often help you learn (though I don't have any experience of this yet).

I have heard many rumors that the United States Government found Tesla's plans shortly after he died and took them for their own.  No one is really sure if this is true or not, and even if they did then why we have yet to see anything very similar to Tesla's designs appear anywhere.  I personally believe that they have used his technology to develop a devastating weapons that they are scared to use for fear of the repercussions.

Nevermind the fact that I am totally out of shape, I've always been a dancer of one kind or another (I even dragged my pathetic pregnant body to lessons at NJ National Ballet until I just couldn't take it anymore I was even a professional bellydancer - excuse me, Middle Eastern Dancer - for about 5 years).
<br>
<br>
In my dreams, I dance effortlessly without my 37-year-old body dragging me down (37 is ancient in dance years).  I can FEEL every muscle in my body moving absolutely correctly and properly (technique is very important if you wish to avoid injury).  I can see how dance work on the Astral could build the kinetic memory needed for a (much younger) person to be able to build a dance fantasy into a professional reality.
<br>
<br>
Imagine:  on the Astral you have seemingly Forever to get a dance move right.  If you have the skill to bring your kinetic memory into your Ordinary waking reality, imagine all the time you could save.
<br>
<br>
Then again, by the time most of us get the Astral thing down we're old geezers.  I guess I should find another hobby.
