<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
This is a copy of a post from another topic, in which I have introduced a concept that I have been considering for quite some time. Actually it is more than a mere concept, as I am very confident that it would function as planned. It does of course require considerable planning, and hence this new topic for initial discussion purposes. Accordingly, all comments, contributions and ideas are most welcome.
<br>
<br>
Here is my original proposal:
<br>
<br>
I have been contemplating the concept of the "Astral locale" meeting place for quite some time, have researched it, and I am quite sure it could work very well indeed.
<br>
<br>
I don't want to go into too many details at this juncture, but it would work something like this.
<br>
<br>
We would find (perhaps with the help of people here) a first rate graphic artist to create an Astral locale as a detailed graphic which would be posted here in the forums under a project topic created for the purpose. We can all have a say in the construction and features. The Astral locale would anyway need to be very carefully thought out, and have a varied and interesting selection fo features such diverse features as meeting places and "doorways" to other realms, e.g. the realms of the Elements, as well as a portal for other parts of the Astral. Beyond that, we are quite literally only limited by the imagination, and the skills of the graphic artist.
<br>
<br>
The very creation of the locale itself will give it an initial Astral presence - everything created in the imagination is created in the Astral initially - but usually only transiently. The graphic would be posted here as the reference point for phasing - similar to the imagery of the Monroe tapes, except we would all us the same imagery - the Astral locale.
<b>
 Everyone
</b>
can participate in this! Those that can phase already will be able to phase to the locale in the Astral and meet with others. Those that cannot yet phase will start with a sort of meditation, which will consist of a degree of relaxation, while keeping the image in mind while imagining travelling and being there. After mentally arriving the traveller would mentally walk around the locale, observe the features and meet and communicate with others. Soon enough, a simple mental presence will be achieved which might or might not be perceivable by the other participants. Over time however, with repeated practice, the mental presence will become stronger and stronger, and soon become a full Astral phased presence perceivable by all present at the locale at the time. As more and more people participate, the Astral locale will become more and more "solid" and permanent, and more and more energetic. This is how locales are created by the Astral residents themselves - repeated use of a created locale gives it permanency.
<br>
<br>
This will not only provide the possibility for a shared Astral experience, but at the same time provide those that cannot yet phase the focal point and motivation to succeed, and supported by everyone else. Experiences and notes can be compared here. The doorways and portals can then be used for onward exploration. I think this would provide a multitude of purposes, including but not limited to assisting people in the phasing process, providing a meeting place, and performing group activities such as retrievals and exploration. I would hope that it would be possible to attract the presence of permanent Astral residents - helpers, guides and many others. It could also be potentially used as a place for meeting deceased relatives, friends and loved ones, by incorporating the methods of Bruce Moen and his friends.
<br>
<br>
I would be interested to get some feedback on this idea.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

It is a very good idea. I like it very much and want to help. Can it be based on an actual physical location which can be photographed? Maybe a combination of scenes, so that even though photoediting tools are used it will look very real already.

<br>
What types of things would you be looking for in this locale? You mentioned having portals and doorways to other realms. Also, having realms of the elements and meeting grounds. Anything else?
<br>
<br>
Tom has a nice idea of photographing scenes. That would make it easier to do if you wanted an open-air or outdoor setting.

<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Photographing an existing scene is an idea, but I am not sure how much that would "confuse" matters when it comes to the meditation and phasing process. An existing physical location will also exist in the "etheric" plane, which in fact is the same as the so called "real-time zone" which we are trying to avoid. The RTZ is neither the physical or Astral proper, although an extension of the Astral.
<br>
<br>
I believe that a custom designed locale would be better, because the participants can give the locale energy and presence, as well as designing it for our purposes. The only problem might arise if some "vistors" took it upon themselves to "alter" the locale, and in which case we would have to create a gateway accessible only by a Sigil, and which only members here would have access to.
<br>
<br>
As to what we are looking for - this is really what we need to discuss. It needs to be an interesting locale in my opinion with such peaceful features as nice pathways and flower beds, and possible with a fountain and other nice features, but also with specific simple meeting areas such as a circle of stones on the ground. Beyond that, we might have meeting places for communing with the deceased, and of course the portals to the realms of the elements, and other realms.
<br>
<br>
These are only my own initial ideas however - if this is to be a community project, which it is, then we need as much input as possible. The finished result needs to be attractive but not overly complex however - we must always keep in mind the primary objectives of creating a common Astral meeting place, while providing people of all abilities the opportunity of participating from day one, and to increase their presence through practice. An important aspect of this is that people who are in the early stages of phasing can participate with totally motivation of having an objective, and while being supported ny the advice and experiences of the other participants.
<br>
<br>
Learning phasing alone can be a lonely experience which requires considerable discipline and dedication - here people have the opportunity for real applying real motivation and which can produce tangible and measurable results as well as developing very valuable long term abilities.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
Adrian-
<br>
Your idea is a stroke of genius, I don't see any reason why it wouldnt work, especially if we get a lot of people focused on it.
<br>
<br>
I think any picture shouldnt be too cluttered however, to make it easier to focus on.
<br>
BTW both phasers and traditional obers can use this technique. Phasers can study the picture and keep the locale in mind as they phase, while traditional obers can use the Robert Bruce technique of projecting into the picture, as described in Astral Dynamics. Put the picture on the wall. Once you have projected, move towards the picure, you will begin to move *into* it, hopefuly ending up in the correct locale.

I agree that this is a great idea, as when I finally perform a real time AP I will be able to directly thank all of the people in this forum that have helped me along the way.  Also, I do think it should not be overly complex for those with weak visualization abilities.  Having to many details may make it difficult for them to focus on while attempting to project.  I agree some form of portals would be nice as well a specific meeting place within this locale for any one who just wants to chat.  I think that the image would be better made by hand and not being a picture as pictures may confuse the mind on which location it is aiming for, atleast that is my opinion.  A hand drawn image could not be mistaken as easily for some other place.  Like I said above I like this idea and will try to provide all the feedback that I can in order to make this idea a reality.

I agree that it shouldn't be too complex.  However, if we really want portals to all these realms and a fountain and such (all of which I agree on), perhaps there could be a simple central area which could be pictured by all. Those with more developed skills would be enough to make the more complex areas stable, and beginners would easily be able to picture this simple central chamber or what-have-you. Just a thought.

Hi folks,
<br>
I have a link here to a part of my website with artwork detailing Tolkien's Middle-earth (ie the setting of 'The Lord of the Rings', the books - not the recent movies).I have the work of two of the most renowned Tolkien artists, John Howe and Alan Lee. The link is:

I'm not saying we should have a Middle-earth inspired locale, its just that these pictures are infused with a certain atmosphere and enchantment that may give some inspiration and further ideas!

Actually the whole concept is an excellant idea. [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>

<br>
Amazing how many people picked up on the idea of portals or gates. That's what caught my attention as well. One suggestion is to either have large raised classic arches as gates or make them high-tech (like those found in 'Stargate'). [8D]
<br>
Perhaps some sort of large garden or Maze might work (for part of the location anyway). The idea of lush and exotic vegetation does sound quite appealing.
<br>
BTW several people at Astral Society tried this concept a while back. They created an Astral Temple though I don't know how well their experiment worked.

<section>
The reason I suggested using photographs as a basis is that it would be easier to see such a place as actually existing. My concern is that it will look like it is from a cartoon because that is the best I could do on my own. The idea of having a place to conveniently meet other people from here mind to mind is very good. I want to see it done well.

I think the simpler the better for now.  Even if its just a pond or something, but works will be great inspiration.  Maybe as time goes on you can add more features.  I dont know about the rest of the people here but even visualizing a detailed chair is very hard for me.

<section>
I would suggest that if this is to work, we would need more than an image to focus on. Most accounts of pre-arranged meetings in the Astral, or travels to meet at a common location, have one thing in common : The participants have some kind of emotional link.
<br>
<br>
Obviously we are missing this.....The closest thing we have is this bulletin board.
<br>
<br>
I suggest that any graphic showing the "astral locale" would have to include something/object that is unique to this bulletin board. This might act as a poor cousin to the emotional bond.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who has contributed with comments, ideas, suggestions, and offers of artisic work so far. I would like to let the topic continue for a while in this creative mode to see what else transpires.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to comment on clandestino's comments regarding emotional links. I do not believe this is necessary for an Astrale locale. The Astral locale imagery is the common link, and its continued visualisation and use will provide it with energy that participants can become a part of. The more people participate, the more energy will surround the locale, and all who make use of it.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again - we really have something here, and I am delighted that we have so many artists in our midsts [

wants and needs
<br>
I think we should come up with more ideas about this place. We could list all of our ideas about comfort and desirable atmospheres. What we also need to focus on is objects or symbols that have to be there. So far I understand that there should be one or more doorways.
<br>
There must be other things that NEED to be there, right?
<br>
<br>
It might be cool to have a statue centerpeice. Something with character might be easy to focus on. It could have something catchy that is easy to visualize and everyone recognizes it (for example: a rubber ducky)...that example might be inapropriate, but you know what I mean.

I think whomever should just design it and people should spend most of their energy on trying to get there.
<br>
<br>
I've seen things like this get talked to death and then people never do it because there's no consensus of even where to start.  One or two people drawing it then put it up fast, that way the idea doesn't just disappear.
<br>
<br>
Thats my opinion mostly based on my experience.

Hi Adrian and other interested adventurers.
<br>
<br>
Being a Novice Pilot [:I]here I don't want to be presumptious but feel strongly toward getting involved in your project Adrian. So here goes.
<br>
<br>
I am not yet actively phasing as yet but definitely moving in that direction with the results of my exercises thus far with Wave1. (Some uncontrolled Phases).
<br>
I am very much interested in this project of the formation the Astral Local.
<br>
Agree with the one who says it can be talked out of existence by not doing just talking and debating [|)]- or something to that effect.
<br>
I was reading some of Franks posts on Energy Exchanges and the buildings (with their portals and the purposes they served)  which he described in that locale (world) has stirred my curiosity. I've yet to read  Bruce Moens' book (my first book to yet read on the Astral)  Journey to the Unknown.
<br>
Reading the accounts on this and the afterlife forums of those courageous folk involved in retrievals has presented me which positive challenges, and others whose posts say they are involved in other??? work makes me wonder at the vastness of opportunities.
<br>
<br>
I am excited with what the future hold in store for me as I allow the  expansion of my horizons and look forward to meeting many of you at this (currently incubating) Locale when it is birthed.[
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>

<br>
<br>
Suggestions On PORTALS[?]
<br>
Portal  Symbols (need)  be universal language i.e. perhaps ancient Runes etc.
<br>
Portals - 12 (why? ) - Could be any number I gess, but to start somewhere12 seems to be very prominent number in the universal
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///language.ie" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 language.ie
</a>
12 months, 12 inches, 12 Zodiac, constellations etc etc....
<br>
As to the type of structure that has the portals
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
I'm open to have the suggestions I put forward challenged and disregarded but I am motivated by this interesting challenge to be a part of something that can be very powerful and creative. That is what brainstorming is all about - get the ideas out into
<br>
he open and build with that - brick by brick!!! Bad brick? Give it the flick!!.[^]
<br>
Next please?
<br>
<br>
Bring it on! Whos got the next brick? perhaps a better brick?LOL...or am I on the wrong planet altogether?

I reckon that we need to get something up and running here .... If the artists amongst us could possibly come up with a few different scenarios, then maybe we could choose our favourite and make it the "astral locale"??

Greetings to all,
<br>
<br>
A little idea here based on the thought that people often find it easier to realise what they don't like, rather than what they do.
<br>
Would it be possible for the artists among us to come up with several different scenarios as Clandestino suggested? Instead of picking a favourite though, having these preliminary designs would allow us to see what we definately don't like. We can eliminate what we don't see fitting, and combine elements of the designs that we do like to give us a blueprint for the perfect locale.
<br>
<br>
My own idea's for the locale can be summed up in two words ~  "Magnificantly simplistic"
<br>
<br>
Take care
<br>
<br>

Maybe it would be helpful if everyone interested puts one feature they really really want and limit it to one?  That way its not overly complex?
<br>

Personally I think having a fountain or even better a pond would be great.  There's something about water, especially in the astral that is really interesting to me.

I think it is more important that there is something there than that there is everything there that everyone agrees on. I like the idea of symbols, and the idea of a central statue. I would suggest that someone invent a unique symbol, one that is fairly simple and easy to visualize, but that you won't find anywhere else. this can be the symbol of the locale. This would then be made into a statue at the centre of the locale. it gives people something to focus on, and then other things can be added surrounding it. Think of it as a work in progress. it doesn't have to be finished BEFORE people start meeting there.

<section>
I vaguely remember reading a description of a meeting place.  The idea was to read this big descriptive paragraph about the location, then try to go there.  I wish I still had it, it created a powerful vivid image in my mind that I still remember.  The details are lost, but basically:
<br>
It incorporates three types of landmasses, like a pie graph.  Imagine one third being ocean, one third plains, and one third mountainous.  The ridge between the two lands merge softly, not sharply.  At the very center are some small cliffs, 12 ft at most, and a waterfall cascades down into a small pool in the rocks.  This pool drains out to the ocean.  The pool is about the size of a regular inground pool, with ledges for sitting, etc.  Plants and flowers wrap around the edges.
<br>
The area far from the pool really isnt important, it just gives a sense of depth.  I guess I like the feeling of seclusion it gives, like a private meeting place near the ocean among friends instead of an empty open field.
<br>
Whatever we pick, a 3d computer image of it would be great.  The computer isnt quite photo-realistic and not cartoony either.  The main advantage over paintings would be the ability to have multiple perspectives of the place, to give it a sense of depth.  We wouldnt need to actually see it in 3d, just have maybe 3 different angles.
<br>
Also, adding senses other than just sight might help.  Like the sound of the waterfall or a certain smell of flowers.
<br>
That's my 2 cents

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much to each and every one of you for your comments, observations and offers of contributions so far. I am considering everything in order that we can all discuss the best way forward soon.
<br>
<br>
For those that wish to participate, I would suggest that you might like to take some time to practice enhancing your imagination/visualisation abilities. High abilities in these are not at all vital to success in this project, because participation alone will provide ongoing practice, but imagination is one of the most powerful Spirtual forces, and well worth the time spent in enhancing your abilities in this area. Incidentally, imagination and visualisation are almost identical, with the latter usually, but not necessarily focussed on the visual aspect of the senses.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again everyone - this is looking extremely promising [

hey, sorry I haven't replied in a while. My life has been a rollercoaster lately. I honestly thought there were other artists willing to get involved with this project. I know that's still a possibility, but I'll come up with some sketchings anyway.
<br>
<br>
one idea: A tall waterfountain structure as a centerpeice, the water flows into a pool, the water from the pool folds over the cliff into the ocean. People can sit in and around the pool. There's grass all around. ....
<br>
<br>
Alright, I was gonna go into detail with all of my ideas to give you something to look forward to, but it's not turning out right. I guess I should get on the drawings and get back to you. ...Then if we come upon a decision, I'll paint the final piece.

One suggestion is to place a (relatively) small pyramid at the center of the locale. This pyramid could be about 100 feet across and 30 to 40 feet high. A pyramid could serve as a mental link between the astral locale and the focus of the group effort at Giza.

<section>
how about this:
<br>
<br>
a stone sidewalk leads up to a huge building. There are rose bushes (or any other kind of flower) hugging the edges of the sidewalk. The building holds a library and numerous doorways to other worlds. It has pillars, like a Roman style building. When you're standing on the stone sidewalk, you could explore the areas to the left or to the right. One area is very plain. It's all grass with a lot of stones set in a circular pattern, like stonehenge. On the other side is a water fountain, the water falls into the pool right beside it. They are so close, that it's almost one piece.
<br>
<br>
ok, so there are three areas to gather: a stonehenge, a building and a pool. If we choose something like this and it's drawn up, just use one of your favorite parts to focus on. Even though the place is full of stuff, you don't have to make it complicated. For example, you could just focus on the water fountain to get there.

I have been reading these forums for ages without registering but this topic has inspired me to post. Just an idea for the centre-piece: a stream running off into the distance with a white stone archway straddling it. On the front and back of the archway is engraved the symbol that we come up with. Hopefully this would give us something unique to focus on whilst the stream would provide  context for the scene.

Hi Mirador. I am new to all of this and would appreciate it if you would explain your statement against the idea of an astral locale for meeting.  You seem to very strongly suggest against such an idea and I think as many people here, including myself are interested in working on this project that you should speak up and explain what you mean for those of us who don't understand. I wouldn't want people to do something that could possibly endanger them somewho......
<br>
<br>
I myself would be interested in helping out as I am quite proficient and particularly my brother (an IT uni student) at working with pictures and surroundings in 2D and 3D on the computer to generate or manipulate the design of the astral locale.....

<section>
Hello everyone!
<br>
<br>
Sorry for my late participation in this matter, but I have had a small vacation up in the Norwegian mountains at my cabin.
<br>
<br>
Well, back to the subject to be discussed. I would really like to participate in this project.  It is a great idea I have had for a long time, but just seemed to me like to big of a task to be done. Now that I see the response to the idea, I feel quite optimistic [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
The idea of this project is simple and is very much likely "do-able". Allthough there are some obstacles we must remember:
<br>
<br>
-How we are supposed to get there:
<br>
Phasing is one way, entering it through a visual picture(RB's way of "VRP"). One thing that we must remember is that the VRP is a pretty easy bethod as long as we "enter" the picture properly.
<br>
Bet this is a problem of those who visualize to get themselves there: It is very hard to vividly visualize a picture in its enirety. If you do get there by visualization it might be that you are the only one there, as your subconcious filled the "holes" left of your memory of the picture. Other times the visualiser might offcourse "get lucky" and enter the actual place. However this gives a lot of "if"s.
<br>
One way of trying to project there is by a symbol, a symbol that we create without allowing it to be influenced by other symbols. This makes a special thing to focus on, as well as it is easy to visualize. For the projector going there "VRP" the symbol must be clearly shown at the picture. This offcourse remains to be proven and tested, but it is an idea/theory at least.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to the location: Very experienced projectors say that it takes time(or a high quantity of will/"willers") before a "thought" is properly manifested "solidely" in the astral. There is one way of solving this problem that I can thing of. Those who are experienced here should "prepare" the location: Travelling there, creating, manifesting and making all the preparations for the less experienced to follow when the location is more or less "solid". As things start to manifest, others should join in and think of a picture that has been created of the location.
<br>
<br>
The "creators" can create whatever they like, no matter how much detail they "imprint". The thing that matters is that they are a ble to manifest it properly.
<br>
<br>
Just my early ideas about this project.
<br>
<br>
P.S We should do a little research about the hazards that might occur(like mentioned earlier). HOWEVER I believe there are no hazards, only hazards that are "created" by malicious projectors or projectors that does not know any better and imprints their unsecurity and fears upon others. Just an opinion that most surely can be wrong as I do not possess quite enough information on the subject.
<br>
<br>
Sicerely,
<br>
TruthSeeker

Portals, a circle like space, central water feature, own up who's been reading my mind!

<br>
The whole site will be overhawled within six months and many of the changes I'm going to make will be of direct benifit to AP/OBers. Also some of the points you've raised in this thread have second guesed the changes to be made to the site.
<br>
<br>
Have a look at the site and tell me what you'd want to see or have changed as there is still time before I crunch it all though a new generation of computer software that will make the place look far far beyond what it does now.

This is not something I have proposed on a whim, it is based upon much more than that I assure you, much more than that I will not say.

An Astral locale such as is being proposed here is no differnt to any other place in the Astral where people can meet.

<br>
Mirador you haven't got a clue what you're talking about. Really. You probably can't even project (or deliberately project on a regular basis). It's highly likey that even if you did choose to participate that you could Not project to a group astral locale. Consider this a (much needed) flame. [}:)]
<br>
To everybody else - sorry about that rant - I couldn't resist.  I pretty much stopped visiting the Psychic Defense Forum because of all the 'I'm possessed by Demons"!! BS.
<br>
Anyway here are two useful suggestions.
<br>
1) The problems of poor visualizers and inexperienced projectors finding the locale can be addressed by emphasizing the central feature of that location. IMHO that's why a dramatic feature, like a pyramid, should be the central feature of the location.
<br>
2) Using the MicroSoft paint feature I will draw up a sketh map of the location and (hopefully) post that map for consideration. It's easier to discuss and debate actual pictures and maps after seeing them.

Also, Greytraveler's suggestion of a central dramatic feature makes a lot of sense as well. Perhaps we can all agree on having a design that would incorporate a "temple" or "pyramid" for example, as a central point. Maybe Pantalimon and Greytraveler can connect up and share some artistic ideas re this?

Pantilimon,
<br>
<br>
I remember your site. I visited a long time ago, because I'm interested in lucidity. I don't know if you changed the locale since then. The one that I saw was like a living room setting in the middle of an orange desert. It had doors all around the living room, also with two blue people who were receptionists.
<br>
<br>
I like the place as it stands for dreaming, because people don't have to stay there long. The astral locale (if you are honest about changing a little) should be a little more earthy and natural. It should be a place were people would like to hang out there. It doesn't have to have receptionists.
<br>
Otherwise, I think it's a wonderful idea and thank you so much for offering your help. ....and doorways are still a good idea!

<section>
With regard to the creation of this Astral Locale (AL?) it may be a good idea to put into this setting some kind of unique feature, which will act as a clear recognition point to everyone who goes there. For example, a statue of stone which has an original form to it (not found anywhere else - at least as far as we know). Something like this could make it easier for people to actually get to this "AL", because they will then have a very strong focall-point to  concentrate on. Also, there will be little chance of someone thinking that they are at this specific location, when in fact they have "landed" somewhere else. This feature has to be unique, and has to stand out. It can be put "in place" as the central point of the "AL" (the point where people arrive at, meet each other, etc..)
<br>
<br>
Just a thought, and one which hopefully will benefit the realisation of this brilliant idea.
<br>
<br>
Take care.
<br>

I have seen so many of these 'meeting in the astral' projects die out over the years. I really hope that we can finally have some success in this.
<br>
<br>
I think there was another project like this that had some success, it was an island created by a group of dreamers...if I do a little hunting around, perhaps I can find the details of it so that we can learn from their mistakes.

You know, one way to make this happen more quickly might be to start with a super simple meeting place.
<br>
<br>
It could be as simple as a standing stone with the letters "A.P." (Astral Pulse) carved into it.  Blue, cloudless sky abvove.  Green grass and gently rolling hills as far as the eye can see.
<br>
<br>
This way it is so simple that people should have little difficulty finding it.
<br>
<br>
All of the bells and whistles can be added later after it's proven that folks can find each other there.
<br>
<br>
Of course I have yet to have an OBE, so this is just a random suggestion.

<br>
I took a weekend to do the images of the space and it was designed as a space that had duel presence both in lucid dreams and on the astral plane. It hasn't changed much except for I put a dojo nearby as I wanted to practice my martial arts whilst lucid.
<br>
<br>
The revamp will take a while as I'm going to be really going to town on the quaility and scope of the place as well using a whole new batch of upto date software.
<br>
<br>
And yes you right it will still retain its odd but calm feel but be more natural in its surroundings. More elements will be specifically aimed at astral projectors, at mo there are the doors, mirror to leave your body into etheric projection, pool to do same. There will also be plenty to do when your there.
<br>
<br>
Anyway as I say its been there for a year now and if anyone has suggestions for the revamp mail me at the Lucid Crossroads. Impossible to please all but I'll try to take as much into account as I can.
<br>
<br>
If anyone does make another such place let me know and I'll place a specific doorway from the lucid crossroads visuals to the new area.

Ok...I havnt read the entire post yet, which I will soon..but I have a great idea (In my opinion) for the location! If it hadnt already been chosen, that is....:
<br>
What about one of those big fluffy clouds..? I saw one with the sun directly under it today...making it kinda sun-setty, but bright on top..and I thought it would be a perfect place. Remember the carebears anyone...? If it were on top of the clouds...it would be so pretttyyyyy
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>

Hi People,
<br>
<br>
I like the concept of your suggestion for creating a locale.  Although it is my experience that meeting places already exist at many 'levels'.
<br>
<br>
In my journeys I have found a number of them, more surprisingly though, is that we can access them by simply choosing to go there, even if we don't know the location in our logical mind.  Our Soul knows them all anyway.
<br>
<br>
One that we all visit regularly, whether we are aware that we do or not, is one sometimes described as a Golden City.  Within the park or gardens there, I have seen all forms of life from the cosmos and most are deep in conversation with other groups or their 'mentors'.
<br>
<br>
Another is one I describe as 'The High Ground', and exists as a most interesting place where many opportunities for advancement are offered.  And these are only two of the places that have existed for all 'time'.  So I see no reason why people cannot use what is already available for us.
<br>
<br>
Apart from that, I see that this project will work very well, as  more people getting involved with it, will help in the creation of it's space in the realms.  As a purely experimental concept, I think it is brilliant, and it shows the expansive consciousness is working well within us.  So please count me in.

The final locale needs to have a few more different features as well. We also need the portals to various other realms including the kingdoms of the elements. Such portals do not need to be doors as such, they could be trees or anything else which has been energised as a portal.

I have been letting this one run for a time to see what ideas and suggestions came up, as well as offers for graphics etc..

The pyramid island looks very good LA FORET MAUVE. The location of the large pyramid as the central feature and also a major portal is a clever idea.[

If more portals are to be added to the island I suggest that several large arches be added along the shore and amoung the trees. Or perhaps both large mirrors and arches.  [8D]

I love API, LA FORET MAUVE, it is amazing.  About adding portals and such I think that stones set across the island could have symbols on them of some sort, something that we make up.  Sort of like those rocks with writing on them that you put in gardens. For us it will be like the symbol is what gives it its ability to transport us where ever we like.  They would be our magical symbols that no one else knows of.  Just a thought.

I think API is great. I suggest that the portals be on each side of the pyrimid. So all 4 sides of the pyrimid have a labeled gateway to 4 diffrent places. Wells thats my idea, so let get this party started!

<br>
<br>
This is one of the whole points of this project.
<br>
<br>
It will provide those who are not expert at AP the focus and motivation to achieve it.
<br>
<br>
The process will work like this. The more people who visualise and focus energy on the locale, the more solid and real it will become in the Astral. This will take some time of course, depending on how many people participate and how frequently the locale is visited.
<br>
The objective is to make it totally solid of course so it remains ad-infinitum.
<br>
<br>
To start with, for those who cannot AP, it will start out as a sort of meditation where you will relax and focus all of your concentration on the locale, and imagine travelling and being there. To start with you would achieve a mental projection where you would be there, but not be perceiveble by others in an Astral body. I think this is the way it will have to be for everyone initially, because the locale needs to be created by visualisation and concentration. It would be possible to create it in the Astral, but that would not be the way to do it - we need as many different people as possible involved. Ideally everyone will perform this meditation once or twice each day, morning and nigh being the best. Soon, if all goes according to plan, people will be able to perceive others there, and what started out as a meditation and mental projection will turn into a full Astral projection.
<br>
<br>
This is actually phasing in every respect; focussing totally on an image with full concentration until your consciousness is projected there. This is the objective of all participants.
<br>
<br>
We need to finalise the design of the locale soon. I really do like API, so all we need to do is to add more details such as portals etc.. Having said that, the portals will need to be created in the Astral at the locale itself. But we can still have the doorways.
<br>
<br>
Personally I think we need a closer view of API as it stands so we can get much more detail on the beach around it, of the palm trees etc. We could also do with extending the beach to facilitate more details, although not too much detail. We need to be mindful of the fact that the locale needs to be an image which can ultimately be memorise for meditation and phasing. To start with however it will be perfectly alright to relax and simply concentrate totally on the image.
<br>
<br>
All other ideas welcome!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I think we need to start moving towards the final concept for the Astral Locale. I personally really like Astral Pulse Island, with the caveat of the modifications I mentioned before; specifically we need a closer perspective where we can see much more detail on the shoreline, more detail of the palm trees and perhaps other details as well. These are all things we can discuss however.

? What do you mean ??!(sorry for my poor english) [B)]
<br>
I think that to draw a map could be interesting but...anyway , the locale will be different for everypeople, everytime we make a visit...this is inevitable...i think it may gains more "solidity" if visited frequently and it's the only way in my opinion...
<br>
What i suggest is to simply meditate/visualise/enterwhenprojecting/whatever on the pic to GO there...and report to make the other members motivation to arise. As the picture is pretty simple it is easier to visualise than a whole thing with too much details...
<br>
I'll try to visualise it, promise...but i still can't project yet, so...[

Oh by the way !
<br>
The more people will look at the pic, the more it will "solidify" in the human mind....is it possible to access the pic without having to browse this thread ? That would be great...or maybe just send it (API spam [

<section>
gandolf's suggestion... i looked at the pics and think the one of the inner cathedral style halls is a great one.  by starting with a contained local, not too many details, it will be easier to concentrate on something simple like this, and there's room to expand to the outdoors and halls windows and doors as we create. but getting "there" to begin with should be a focal point that is less complicated. The "meeting hall" or inner sanctum...whatever. A.

p.s. why didn't we think of this sooner? with a committed concious effort, I believe i will be seeing you all real soon!

I agree we need to make a start on this with as many people as possible. What I intend to do is to make a web page just for this API project with the final picture and the objectives, instructions etc..
<br>
<br>
Regarding my comments, I was suggesting we could do with a closer view so we can see more detail to focus on. As it is, people will try to add their own details which might conflict. Once the basic locale is in place, the portals can be added in the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Is it possible to do a closer view with more details?

Thanks for all your excellent work on this!

I think in the pyramid (if API ends up being the locale, which I think would be as good as any other whatever else you want is in the pyramid) there should be an area for people to practice defence against negative entities and an area for pool[8].

Hi There,
<br>
<br>
Yesterday i projected to the Astral Pulse Island. Island was quite bigger than i expected. I was flying over the sea and getting closer to the island every second. Finally when i arrived i landed on the shore and looked for someone on the island. But nobody was there...
<br>
<br>
I tried to go to the pyramid and i just couldnt find a way. Because the trees were blocking my way. I tried to fly over the trees but I couldnt land on the pyramid. It was boring and there was nothing more to do. So i projected somewhere else....
<br>

Yahoooo !!! You did it !!! Congratulations !

Why didn't you started to build the path to the pyramid for us ? [

<br>
I am glad that someone at last could go there, even if it was boring to be alone ! The problem is that it will be difficult for us to be here in the same time (for example when you, europeans are sleeping, i am awake in Japan, etc. But it is worth the try, i think that there will be the "americans time", then the "europeans time", etc...[|)]
<br>
For the closier vew of the Island, i will see what i can do, but i think that others could attempt to draw maps or photoshoping...it is a team's work after all, our creation !
<br>
Good luck all...
<br>
Oh, just an idea: why not to write your name on the rootbark of a coconut tree when you visit the island...just a little experimental thing...
<br>

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Congratulations Birm on your trip to Astral Pulse Island!
<br>
<br>
I think it is time we started to finalise things and start to move things forward.
<br>
<br>
Once more people are focussed on API, and are visualising, meditating on the image etc., things will start to really move. Some people will have a purely mental presence to start with and progress to an Astral presence, while others will Astral project there straightway. It will soon all come together.
<br>
<br>
I think the best place to modify the locale is from the Astral, we can discuss it as we go along.
<br>
<br>
I will start to put a web page together when I get the time, and we can then decide on a launch date as it were. The sooner the better.
<br>
<br>

<br>

Adrian.

Thanks Adrian,
<br>
<br>
But i am curious about a few things.
<br>
<br>
I projected to the Astral Pulse Island a few times just to see if i can meet some others there. But i never had an experience on meeting with someone also projecting at the same time. So i dont know if it is going to work. Once i saw two people on the island. They were just standing there. They were doing nothing. They seemed like frozen to me. They were also looking like shadows. Everything around was perfectly clear and colorful but they were just gray. I tried to  communicate with one of them. But they just didnt answer me.
<br>
<br>
I dont know if i am doing something wrong...

 Thanks Adrian,
 <br>
 <br>
 But i am curious about a few things.
 <br>
 <br>
 I projected to the Astral Pulse Island a few times just to see if i can meet some others there. But i never had an experience on meeting with someone also projecting at the same time. So i dont know if it is going to work. Once i saw two people on the island. They were just standing there. They were doing nothing. They seemed like frozen to me. They were also looking like shadows. Everything around was perfectly clear and colorful but they were just gray. I tried to  communicate with one of them. But they just didnt answer me.
 <br>
 <br>
 I dont know if i am doing something wrong...
 <br>

<br>
Thank you very much indeed for describing your experiences.
<br>
<br>
No, I am sure you are doing nothing wrong at all. The project has not been officially launched, and not many people will be trying to get to the Astral locale, at least not on an oganised basis. The people you saw there were probably Astral Pulse members who were visualising the image, but there a mental presence, or semi-Astral presence. Once things get moving we will have both Astral and Mental levels of presence, with the people who start off with a Mental presence progressing to full Astral; which is one of the objectives.
<br>
<br>
I am just putting a web page together for the project as a basis for getting this project launched, at which point I will make an announcement to all members, and we wil have another topic in the forums for it.
<br>
<br>
It would be useful if you could tell everyone here what method you use to project as it seems very effective in getting to API.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With best results,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Brim you rule.
<br>
<br>
Note: I'm no expert in projection but I'm willing to bet those were newbies like me. Did you try to talk to them? Just say, "Hey! This is Brim!" or something like that. It'll freak us out but we'll *KNOW* we were there. Then we can post and you can confirm and then there's a confirmation and everyone's happy. That kind of thing is *exactly* what you guys want with this island isn't it?
<br>
<br>
Also, if you're dealing with someone like me, I'm probably not going to be able to see you or do anything anyways 'cause I can't see Astrally yet. The best I've ever been able to do is a regular blue light/fog of varying size. So, if I move there, being able to hear comments encouragement would be great! It would be best if messages to newbs were very specific though. So we can differentiate between the voices we hear "on the threshold" and... actual... useful... feedback... (MAJOR SARCASM inherent with that comment but that's personal).

Well, I actually start with meditating first. While breath meditation goes on i try to relax as i can. After a while i stop breath meditation and try to hear and see with my astral senses. At that point i may see various images and visions. If the visions are not clear enough to me. I start trying the triangle method in order to get to a higher level of conciousness. I try to look deeper to the visions next time. If the vision is clear enough i start to watch the visions. At that point i may loose my conciousness in the visions. (Sometimes i feel the seperation here, sometimes i dont) Then i realize that i am in a lucid dream at that point. (Focus 22) I start flying over an ocean. The ocean has deep blue colors. I look at the ocean while flying. Then i arrive at the Astral Pulse Island. I land on the sands first and walk around the island if i can meet someone.
<br>
<br>
Also i have to tell you that there is a small boat on the shore. But i didnt put it there. I can always find it anyway.

Well i tried to talk to them of course. But they just didnt answer. As Adrian said, I think they were people asleep or people trying to project. I read about this on Robert Bruce's articles too. But they were not at my conciousness level so we couldnt communicate.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I will try to wake you up when i see you there next time. [

<section>
Birm-
<br>
I haven't tried to visit the API yet. But regarding your experience with others there, I've had something similar happen to me. I actually saw someone I knew from waking life in some place in the astral (was 'blown' to this place by a wind of some sort -- very strange). Anyways everyone there was a light grey color, almost like cigarette smoke. I recognized her and went up to her. But she looked really 'dull', not as bright a grey as others around there. And she seemed dazed or 'out of it'.
<br>
<br>
She was conversing with someone in Spanish (she's hispanic). I said hello to her. She looked at me strangely, then she seemed to recognize me. I think she got a little 'brighter' when she made the connection. She said hello back, but quickly went 'dim' again and began talking to the other person with her.
<br>
<br>
My immediate thought was that she's dreaming and isn't conscious of what was going on. I told her the next day that I had a dream about her (she doesn't believe and/or undestand astral travel so I didn't use that word). I was hoping she'd make a connection, but she didn't say anything other than "what was it about?".
<br>
<br>
All of that to say, that either they were asleep or were not consciously aware of where they were and what they were doing.

i feel strange about the little boat...

i never been to Api yet, but when creating the image, i couldn't help thinking about a little boat to make the connection with the little...i can't say it in english...you know the thing in wood at the right of the island...you see ?

Well yes there is a small boat near the dock. But it is not tied to the dock. It stays on the sands. Only two people can fit in it. One on the back and one on the front. There is no boat in the picture though. I dont know who put it there...

I think this is an important point ! You didn't knew there was a boat there but you saw it...Why ?
<br>
Maybe because someone else saw it and made it "alive" during visualisation.
<br>
Maybe because you noticed it without knowing it ?
<br>
Or...i don't know...any idea ?

<section>
Everyone would have subconsciously caught that boat regardless of whether they consciously saw it or not, at least according to what I've read on that type of thing. So the boat being rock solid there is easy to understand. The fact that you can't get through the trees and the island is so big isn't easy to understand. Maybe someone's imagination is a little to powerful or something.

<br>
Ok i will go in detail:
<br>
<br>
As an engineer i always try to identify things, how they happen, the reasons behind them and their benefits.. I have been trying to identify my astral senses for a month and i think we can still feel these senses while we are wide awake. But in the astral these senses are far more stronger. Let me give an example: Now close your eyes and look behind your eyelids, dont try to imagine anything just watch! You started to see some images right? But they were very blurry, dark and unshaped. While i am doing breath meditation in order to relax my physical body. I also wait for these visions to become clearer. After a while they will become perfectly clear. Some times they can move into a rectangle. Just like wathcing them in a movie screen. These show me that i am achieving an altered state of conciousness.
<br>
<br>
The process is simple i think. The most important things are:
<br>
<br>
i never try to visualize anything,
<br>
i never try to have control over the visions,
<br>
i never try to feel my physical body.
<br>
<br>
<br>

 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
You can do it any time of the day. I wear a black bandage over my eyes in order to avoid daylight.
<br>
<br>
Waking early in the morning has far more benefits i think but i can only do it on weekends. When i wake in the morning, i lay on my bed and i read for about 20 minutes in order to wake my conciousness. I dont eat anything. I dont do any physical activity. I just try to wake my conciousness. After then i lay down and start the breath meditation.
<br>
<br>
When doing in the morning i feel like i am trying to stay awake and keep my conciousness aware. While on the other hand when projecting from wide awake i am trying to fall asleep while keeping my conciousness aware.
<br>
<br>
Hope this was helpful,
<br>
.

Greetings Birm,
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for clarifying your method. In fact, the method you are using is one which I rate extremely highly; no doubting its effectiveness. This is phasing in its absolute terms.
<br>
<br>
Achieving the "Astral screen" effect is crucial to success, after that it is a matter of entering the screen. This leads me to another couple of questions for the benefit of those following this method:
<br>
<br>
1) How do you "feel" for your Astral senses?
<br>
<br>
2) How many months of practice did it take you to achieve the Astral screen stage? I think many people see the hypnagogic imagery, but never reach the Astral stage from what I read in the forums.
<br>
<br>
3) Do you lose the feeling of your physical body completely during this process, or care you still aware of it while phasing?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Well I didnt know i was phasing, i thought i put it all together from what i read. So i am glad to hear that this method is known by other projectors. I think everyone can project using this method because it is easy and very effective. Especially for learning the astral senses i think.

<br>
<br>
Well i developed a technique named Triangle Method which you can find in the Astral conciousness forums. What i did was to examine the feelings and senses i am experiencing in the astral. I thought if i could get used to these feelings i would be able to travel through astral anytime i want. All i needed was to remember the senses and to concentrate on them.
<br>
<br>
So on experimenting the senses i realized a sound coming from my ears when i wake up in the morning. This sound seemed like it is always there. You can find the details on The Triangle Method topic. I experimented with the sound furhter. When i am in the astral i dont hear such sound. But on the other hand when i enter the seperation process i may hear it getting louder and louder. While it is getting louder it mixes with animal screams or human voices.
<br>
<br>
In Turkey there is a word when you hear a ringing sound in one of your ears saying "Someone is thinking about you." I wonder if this saying has any relations...
<br>
<br>
Astral senses are a lot different than physical senses so describing them is very hard. I mean i feel like i am trying to describe the seeing sensation to a blind person when i try to describe my astral senses.
<br>
<br>
There is a discussion on Astral Experiences forum i made with TheLunatic about this. You can find it. The topic is named "OOBE I just had! - Extended Discussion"...

  2) How many months of practice did it take you to achieve the Astral screen stage? I think many people see the hypnagogic imagery, but never reach the Astral stage from what I read in the forums.

<br>
<br>
It took only one month actually. I first experienced the astral screen while i was experimenting with the BWGEN. I was trying the Deep Mind IV preset. That was an experimentation so i was trying to see what happens when i use Bwgen. So i was a passive observer. I was letting the images and visions come and go just as letting the thoughts come and go when meditating. I think the hypnagogic imagery is some sort of thinking but thinking with the imagery instead of words. Seeing the hypnagogic images happens in an altered state of mind. But if you want to project you will have to move into a deeper state of mind. I dont use Bwgen. I even uninstalled the program. But it really helps for the newbies i think.
<br>
<br>
I also want to say that some people are reaching the astral stage but never realize they reached it. They think they are just seeing hypnogogic imagery. Because they dont know what they will feel or see when projecting. Also their expectations are always different than what they will encounter.

  3) Do you lose the feeling of your physical body completely during this process, or care you still aware of it while phasing?

<br>
In RTZ: I can feel my body. I can feel both my physical senses and astral senses at the same time...
<br>
<br>
In Astral Plane: I Completely loose the physical body feelings...
<br>
<br>
I had a lot of experiments on this. First of all i have to tell you that you will feel a body. But it is not your physical body. You will feel arms, legs, hands, toes... So you will feel you are still aware of your body. But YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF IT. At least in my experience... I came to this conclusion by trying to move my muscles while projecting. I was in the astral plane and i was in some sort of Lucid dream. There were people around, trees, things... I wondered if i could be able to move into RTZ from there. So as Mr. Bruce said i tried to feel my physical body at the same time. I tried to feel both of my bodies. But i couldnt feel my physical body. So i tried to raise my right hand. All the visions around me melted away and i was forcing my self to move my right hand i felt totally paralyzed. Within tree seconds i moved my right hand and opened my physical eyes at the same time. I was forced myself back into my physical body. My body was numb, i felt very tired and i wanted to sleep. I realized i was laying down on my bed that moment. I slowly started to forget about the scenery in the astral as i was focusing on the Real world.

Greetings Birm,
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for your further explanations!
<br>
<br>
Yes, the process you are using to Astral project is most definitely phasing, there is no doubts about that at all.
<br>
<br>
Andthank you once again for sharing your methods with everyone![

<br>
<br>
I would highly recommend everyone reviews this topic, it contains much useful information.
<br>
<br>
One followup question I would like to ask is regarding the Astral senses you focus on to project. I know about focussing on the brow chakra, the third eye, but could you say more about the Astral hearing. I don't really have a CD player or whatever to try as you suggested. Is the Astral noise you rfer to like a fairly high pitched tone in your ears?
<br>
<br>
It makes tremendous sense to focus on the Astral body as well if possible. The Astral body can be sensed by relaxing, and extending the awareness a few millimetres out from the physical. The Astral body can be sensed as a sort of energy glow, not easy to describe, but unmistakable when you feel it. I know someone in fact who simply feels his Astral body and then simply stands up with it leaving the physical lying or sitting down. This is definitely well worth experimenting with. And thanks again Birm for sharing your work with us.
<br>
<br>
Just a couple more questions: when you get to the Astral screen stage, do you simply get sucked into the scene in the screen, or do you have to consciously project through it?
<br>
<br>
How often did you use BWGEN with Deep Mind IV before you saw the screen for the first time, and how often did you practice this process before succeeding?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Well First of all i have to tell you that when i am in the astral i dont hear such sound. But I hear it when i lie in my bed and try to sleep. It takes about 5 minutes for the sound to start ringing. And in the morning when i wake up i can hear it before i focus into the real world.
<br>
<br>
Yes it is a fairly high pitched tone in my ears. In one of my experiments i realized that it gets louder when the vibrations come all over you. It is like you are standing on a railway and you hear a train is coming from miles away, you hear it, you wait for it, as the train gets closer the rails start to shake, you can feel the train is coming as its noise gets louder...
<br>
<br>
In my experience i think it is something like the hypnagogic images, so maybe we can call it "hypnagogic sound." Triangle method utilizes the hypnagogic sounds while phasing utilizes hypnagogic images. Here is a comparison of the two methods:
<br>
<br>
When you relax and wait for the hypnagogic images, they start to appear slowly, changing shape every moment.
<br>
When you relax and wait for the hypnagogic sound, the sound is hard to hear at first.
<br>
<br>
As you get deeper on your relaxation:
<br>
The hypnagogic images start to be meaningful to you, you start to identify the images.
<br>
The hypnagogic sound sorrounds you, you feel like you are in an other room than yours, but you can hear the physical sounds clearly so your mind confirms that you are still in your room, in your physical body.
<br>
<br>
As you get more deeper on your relaxation:
<br>
The hypnagogic images become visions, images become 3D, Scenery sorrounds you.
<br>
The hypnagogic sound becomes a part of the room you are in. You can hear a few words or sounds, but you can realize that you had heard these a few hours ago. I once heard my partner saying "We did a good work here." He told this 5 hours before and it was definitely his voice.
<br>
<br>
As you get deeper and deeper on your relaxation:
<br>
You start to loose your conciousness, it is hard to hold on and concentrate on your breathing at this point. Because you can hardly hear or feel your breathing...
<br>
The hypnagogic images move away from you, You are like in a cinema, looking at the movie screen... Hypnagogic visions are on the screen.
<br>
The hypnagogic sound is all that you can clearly hear. The physical sounds are coming from far away, Its like you are in another room and you put your ear on the wall to hear them. Just like the movie screen. You are in "somewhere you dont know" and you are hearing the physical sounds from a radio.
<br>
<br>
While entering the Astral Plane (Phasing Method):
<br>
You are sucked by the movie screen unconciously, Blackout may occur, you may loose your conciousness at this point, You may fall asleep as a reflex... If you had an intention you will find yourself there, if you didnt have an intention you will be in the void. You wont feel your physical body anymore...
<br>
<br>
While entering the Real Time Zone (Triangle Method):
<br>
The hypnagogic sounds get louder as the vibrations start all over your body, You start to hear a lot of noises, you can hear animal and/or human screams,  you can hear people talking... Suddenly all the sounds and vibrations dissapear and you find yourself in your room.

<br>
Well sometimes i do and sometimes i dont... In the Astral screen stage i dont do anything but i wait for a deeper state of conciousness. After a while two things may happen: If i had an intention to do something before i start i usually find myself there, otherwise i will find myself in the void where "nothing" sorrounds me. If i find myself in the void i conciously decide to project anywhere i want. But i have to tell you that i usually forget about the real world while i am in the void. So i may forget about my experiments and i may project to unexpected places.

<br>
<br>
Actually it was on my second trial with bwgen, I was counting the sounds instead of counting my breathing. On my first trial i felt a swaying sensation over my body, and on my second trial i saw the Astral screen. I experimented with bwgen for a week and then i uninstalled it. Because i dont need it anymore.
<br>
<br>
I learned to project in a month, every single day i worked on it, I spent three weekends at home trying to project. I read a lot, and i decided not to read so much. I decided not to use a method but to put it all together in order to learn the basics of it and discover a new method that suits me fine.
<br>
<br>
Last word: "If you want to do it, you will have to work hard."

<br>
I get the 'cinema screen effect', or focus22, fairly regularly now. Luckily for me, I am a bit of a natural nowadays, in that I randomly wake up during the night in exactly the right frame of mind to bring on the effect. This occurs about twice a month or so. I then just concentrate on the images.
<br>
In answer to your query, I find that I can just lie back and observe these scenes,  which are like 3d video except much more real, or I can try to enter the scene and enter the astral itself.
<br>
I find that in order to do this I have to will myself forwards. If I do this hard enough I will move quickly forward and enter the astral scene properly.
<br>
However, this is just my experience, others may find themselves 'sucked' towards it, but this has never been my experience.
<br>
<br>
Douglas
<br>
<br>
PS Next time I get the 'screen effect' I will try to cocus on the API. If I get a chance to walk/fly around the island I'll report back and let you know.
<br>
As I said before in another post, although its good to plan ahead and organise group visits, I think firstly we should just try to get as many people to visit it as possible, even on their own, as the more who visit it, the more solid it becomes.
<br>
<br>
btw well done Birm for making it first!

Thank you Gandalf. I hope to see other people in API soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
I started to feel a doubt about my visit because nobody else has visited there yet. So i put up two welcome signs on the sands. Whenever i go there again i find them. If anybody goes there please let me know about the signs. Read them and tell me what is written please. So i can be sure i am successful.

Btw pyramid has an entrance now but it is too dark inside... I didnt put the entrance there tough...

Greetings Birm,
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for your feedback. API is being worked on, and in due course should have some excellent features [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
I am not too surprised you haven't seen anyone, not too many people know about it as yet, and those who do will be trying to visit at different times, and many of which will be by mental projection at this stage. In an Astral state is is often difficult to perceive the much finer density of the Mental body.
<br>
<br>
I would ask people to keep API in mind as often as possible and to try to travel there by Mental and Astral projection at every opportunity. In particular, as Gandalf has suggested, if you wake up a couple of hours or so before normal, instead of going straight to sleep again, try to go straight into phasing mode by holding the image of API in mind and visualising yourself travelling there.
<br>
<br>
We will have an official launch and organised times soon.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hello Everyone
<br>
Adrian asked me to add some astral enhancements to the locale. He mentioned also that someone had been leaving signs around. I saw one that said this way to the pyramid. I also saw another one that said fish.
<br>
I added a doorway to the pyramid. I also added guides inside of the pyramid. They are depending upon what you want to see a egyptian female that looks like a tomb painting, an egyptian male that looks like a tomb painting. A representation of Anubis being the teacher about egyptian science and instructing everyone. I do have the mummy waundering around trying to wrap up his bandages and saying Hello to everyone who visits his tomb.
<br>
I had not read the comments on this subject for a while. I just told Adrian I had made enhancements. Torches will flare up once you get inside of the pyramid.

<br>
I hadn't even heard of this until just now when i saw the new section for it (man, this place is growing and growing![

]), but i have to say that it's a fabulous idea and it seems ot be coming along nicely. I can't project or phase yet, but i have been tryign breifly for the last couple of nights and had some sort of success. I look forward to making it to the island one day soon and hopefully seeing others there too![

<br>
<br>
One question: will the island be just an astral representation of the boards? What i mean by that is, will there be a specific section on island for astral chat, a section for magic, a section for general metaphysics etc or is it just a general area for people to visit, explore and converse?
<br>
I don't mind either way, i'm just curious [

Yes, i still cant believe it, i wish Nita would find them without Adrian's request to look for them. But anyway this is a real proof for myself. I am highly motivated right now on this. Everybody has their own will to believe it. I believe it and thats what bothers me.
<br>
<br>
I am very happy to prove i can project there to myself.
<br>
<br>
The sings were a little different but this is acceptable. I will go there myself to see how they look like... There must be the word "Welcome" there... And not fish but dock...
<br>
<br>
But reading is interpreting so i can accept it as true...
<br>
But i can be sure if Nita would tell us what were the signs made of...
<br>
Were they wood or metal?
<br>
<br>
I can pm anyone the correct answer before nita answers...
<br>
<br>
My Astral research goes on!!!

I think we should creat something bigger than that island. It´s a starting phase, so why we don´t put more images and ideas before the final image (the one- very good- that Foret Mauve posted).
<br>
<br>
My idea it´s that we could create something similat to Tolkien world in the Silmarillion: the house of Valares, the gods. The island it should be like great plains, with very soft grass. At the center, the meeting point, it would exist 2 trees (this ideas are from Tolkien): one with light green foliage, with golden water falling from there, and other tree with dark foliage, but with a silver liquid. The trees would produce a nice light effect, much more beautiful and oniric than the effects produced by tree in spring. The liquids falling from the trees would creat a lake, very brightness and quiet.
<br>
<br>
The trees would have a great quantity of birds of thousands of colors singing in the branches and flying around. The plains, to one side, would have a tapestry of roses or any other kind of flowers (from this point on i´m inventing). To other side, in the horizon we wculd see a giant cascade falling from the clouds and producing a very beautiful fog-like effect with a rainbow crossing it. In one of the four directions we could creat a huge planet in the horizon (a saturn-like). The other direction could have a great forest and mountains. Later we could creat some "magic" things that would give some different beauty to the island, like putting (in a specific zone of the island) raining flowers in somewhere, or a beautiful sound coming from nowwhere..anything that you remember.
<br>
<br>
These are some ideas, but i don´tknow how to show you how i imagine them. I know very little about 3d computer work creation, but if someone here worls wth 3dstudio very well, maybe i could help him doing minor objects to the island (really minor! need to learn many things).
<br>
<br>
We could give the name Valinor to the island, like in Tolkien books.
<br>
<br>
I sugest you, Adrian, that you should put (in a later stage) some kind of votation about some aspects of the island. For example, people would vote (in the first votation) if the island in a general way would be green or sandy or rocky, etc and if it would have the format of a sea island or of a flying island, etc. After we decided that, we should decide any other  aspect of the island, but not so general this time, and we would continue doing that until we have some good idea of what we would want. Them we would ask for the help of artists (how much, how better). The best picture would be voted.
<br>
<br>
What do you think about this ideas?

Greetings Kazbadan,
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your suggestions.
<br>
<br>
The objective was to keep things fairly simple but easy to visualise. Anything too complex would defeat the object of creating a locale which most people can easily visualise and project to.
<br>
<br>
The pyramid will be the focal point of lots of activities and later gateways to different realms such as the realms of the kingdoms of the four elements. It is these gateways which will lead to many interesting and infinite places. Of course, once people have achieved Astral projection, there is no reason why anyone shouldn't go anywhere they wish in the Astral.
<br>
<br>
This is a long term project and I am sure it will evolve as time progresses.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Adrian_
<br>
I agree.
<br>
The current picture we have of the API is our starting point, and for better or worse is now the picture that is circulating around the board and being used (and I for one think its great, and not too complicated or cluttered!).
<br>
<br>
We MUST allow people to spend time getting used to it and projecting to it. Otherwise, I can tell you now, the whole thing will fail. The constant urge to tinker with the picture and constant modifications is the primary reason why other attempts of this nature have failed in the past. People were just getting used to visulisng the locale when someone altered the picture with more clutter. Later additions are indeed possible but these will occur at the Locale ITSELF, not on the picture!
<br>
So of course if you have a great idea for the locale thats fine, but this can be added to the locale itself, at least at this stage.
<br>
<br>

Hi there,
<br>
<br>
Last night i projected to the island and interesting things happened... Here are the details...
<br>
<br>
After having a bath i laid on my bed and tried the triangle method. Soon the images turned out into visions and become clearer, i started to float on an ocean, and soon i came up to the API. I was high in the air, looking at the island. I saw the signs on the shore and decided to examine them. The signs were as i created them and i decided to enter the pyramid in order to see the changes. I entered through the doorway and i saw torches on the left and right walls. The light from the torches were glowing. I felt like i am in the computer game Tomb Raider III. I thought that i may be creating the experience then. I looked around and saw two people there, one male and one female. I tried to talk to the female. I said "Do you know nita?" and she said "yes." I said "Where is she now?" and she said "She is not here". (Is Nita a woman? I dont know...)I said "Can you talk Turkish?" and she said "I am not supposed to do so." Then i thought it was strange because i knew that my mind was interpreting the messages so i would understand it in turkish too. But the woman said she would talk in english only. I thought that was strange. I got outside of the pyramid. The woman came outside. I was floating upwards and she said "Come down." I said "I cant control myself." She said "Try harder" Then i floated down on the sands. I asked her "What is your name?" and she said something like "stz". I said "Stazee???" She repeated her name again and i said "Stacy?" Then i thought it would be a strange name for an egyptian woman. Then i said "Never mind, I cant understand your name..." So i entered the pyramid again in order to talk to someone else because it was the first time i talked to someone this long. There was a door on the right and there was a tomb in it and a mummy was walking around the tomb. Then i looked for the other rooms in the pyramid but i felt strange because the rooms were changing shape. I felt like they were changing shape so i got outside. I doubted on my projection. I looked at the signs again and they were the same as before. Then i realized that the signs were always looking the same because i had created them. But the things in the pyramid were experimental to me. Then suddenly i remembered about my aunt. She passed away 4 days ago. I tried to find her and she appeared suddenly. I said "How are you?" and she said "I am fine, how about you?" It was definetly her voice and we were talking in turkish. I said "I am doing fine anyway, so you died and it all had ended. How lucky you are... " and she said "Take your time, you will come here for sure." Then i said "Aunt, can you help me on projecting to the API?" and she said "Yes, lets go there..." Then we appeared in the Island. I was on the shore and she started flying over the island. I was amazed because it was the first time i saw someone flying in the astral. I said "Aunt, you have learned to move in the astral so quickly." and she said "Now i belong here and there are a lot of helpers here." Then i told her about the pyramid. I said "The room is changing shape, why?" and she replied "You are interpreting the energy of the locale. Just like listening to someone. Your mind is interpreting the message so you are understanding it in turkish. And you are seeing everything on your own way here." i said "This is amazing. You mean seeing is just like listening." She replied "Yes, thats why some places feel like heaven for some people while it feels like hell for others. For a poor man a thousand dollars worth a million and for a rich man a thousand dollars worth a dollar." I said "What about the physical life we are living? Is it some sort of Astral plane?" She said "Yes but physical plane is a little different. We are being tested there." She started to fly again in the air. I said "Aunt, What is your name?" I was trying to figure out about the Dynamics of the Astral. I had asked the woman in the pyramid about her name but i couldnt understand her name. So i asked my aunt her name, because i knew her name. My Aunt said "Valer" or "Varel" I was shocked. This wasnt her name. I said "Why is your name different? Are you someone else? Are you sure you are my aunt?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
" She said "We talk a different language here. And you are not qualified enough to understand it yet." Well everything was like in a dream but i was fully concious. So i asked her to talk in her own language. She said something like "bgkghbbhhvhhvhbh" Like someone is talking while her mouth is full of water. Then suddenly she said "Now go." I said "Why, i want to stay..." She said "You have to go now." I said "No i dont want to go. I want to explore more." She said "Go." I blacked out. I was in the void. Was that a dream? Did i projected to API? What about interpreting the island? I got confused. So until next time i will think about what i experienced.
<br>
<br>
Astral is hard to understand really. I feel like i am a stranger in a strange land.

Brim ,  That is indeed a very interesting story.
<br>
<br>
I would say that was most definitely a projection and not a dream.
<br>
When you checked back to look at the API sign you made and found that it still reads the same thing confirms that it is a
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///projection.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 projection.In
</a>
a dream , more likely than not you would find that the sign would not of read the same.

Birm_
<br>
Great post.
<br>
Regarding the man and woman you saw on the island: I think they are both astral constructs put there by someone, either on purpose or without realising. didnt someone try to put helpers there?
<br>
<br>
Because they are thought forms created by someone, 'energy programs' if you like, they can vary in their intelligence according to how well they were constructed.
<br>
<br>
I believe this is why you had problems communicating with them, as they were probably created by an english speaking person and they were not really designed with enough freedom to 'think' outside of this. Also, seeing how they were just an experiment I don't imagine they would be very helpful or intuitive either!
<br>
<br>
Interesting that the pyramid looks a bit like 'tomb raider'. This doesnt suprise me as Tomb raider is a popular game and the person who constructed the interior used this as inspirition, (esp torches that flame up!).
<br>
<br>
It makes sense that the interior is still in flux as no-one has settled on any final looks as yet. However most people are content with the outside.. this is why it is quite solid.... IMO this all fits in with the reality of the locale at the present time.
<br>
<br>
Your encounter with your aunt is very interesting. The problem is trying to figure out what she *actually said* as opposed to what *your mind* thinks she actually said; as you say, there is an 'interpreter effect' that we should take account of when communicating. I think this becomes easier as we get more used to astral realms but for a relative beginner like most of us here, is difficult.
<br>
<br>
However, from other accounts I have read, a person on the astral can sometimes adopt a different name to the one they had in their last life on earth.
<br>

  I agree.
  <br>
  The current picture we have of the API is our starting point, and for better or worse is now the picture that is circulating around the board and being used (and I for one think its great, and not too complicated or cluttered!).
  <br>
  <br>
  We MUST allow people to spend time getting used to it and projecting to it. Otherwise, I can tell you now, the whole thing will fail. The constant urge to tinker with the picture and constant modifications is the primary reason why other attempts of this nature have failed in the past. People were just getting used to visulisng the locale when someone altered the picture with more clutter. Later additions are indeed possible but these will occur at the Locale ITSELF, not on the picture!
  <br>
  So of course if you have a great idea for the locale thats fine, but this can be added to the locale itself, at least at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<br>
Yes you are absolutely correct.
<br>
<br>
The image must remain static as a starting point for visualisation and projection. All of the modifications are taking place at the locale itself and will continue to be so. The pyramid has already been given an entrance and with various "helpers" and other creations within.
<br>
<br>
This will definitely develop as time progresses, and ultimately it is for each and every person to make the most of it.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

<section>
I´m worried with something: somewhere in his last post, Birm asked if it was a dream or an API (what does that mean?: Astral Projection I...?). If astral projection is real, why does he was asking about that? Is AP like a dream or what? Many people say that obes, APs, etc, are more real that the reality itself, but sometimes they refer too that "it looks like a dream", and that is bad to listen, ´cause dream are just dreams, even if they are very beautiful (and i had in the past really very beatifull dream, amazing dreams- but they were dreams).

<br>
It all depends on your definition of 'dreams'. Most people dismiss their nightime adventures as 'just a dream'.
<br>
IMO 'dreams', 'lucid dreams' and 'astral experiences' are in fact all facets of the same thing... they are all astral experiences. The only difference between them is the level of *conscious awareness*.
<br>
<br>
The three main levels are:
<br>
<br>
Dream level: almost none, the individual is at the mercy of his/her subconscious astral creations/scenarios.
<br>
<br>
Lucid dream: higher awareness. Almost normal. The individual can take control of the immediate astral eviroment as generated by his/her subconscious and modify it at will. Another possibility is to dissipate the local suroundings and emerge in the astral proper.
<br>
<br>
Astral experience: awareness at waking level (normal) or even higher. The individual is in the astral proper... 'nuff said!

<section>
I forgot to add something:
<br>
An individual's awareness during a single session can waver between all three points during the course of the experience. Often people start at 'astral experience' level and drop down towards the end into 'dream' mode, where everything starts getting confused. In other cases the sequence might go the other way.
<br>
<br>
From reading Birm's account, I think he started off well but towards the end of the experience he dropped down to sub-lucid/dream level, which explains why his aunt started acting rather oddly towards the end; Bilm's mind would be tryng to see through the fog of confusion, trying to work out what was being said, which can lead to problems with interpretation.
<br>
<br>
I remember Frank always advised people to drop out of the expeience if they felt their awareness slip; they could then start again fresh later on.

And why is that? Why does the level of awareness drops? What can be done do avod that? Does it happens all the time that you obe? In the near death experiences relates that i read, i didn´t saw antything that indicates that drop of level.  Why in near death exps. it´s different (aand in normal obes in RTZ?)?
<br>
<br>
sorry about so many questions!! but i´m curious about everything

thanks

<br>
<br>
The difference between a conscious AP (whether into the astral or to the RT zone) and a 'near death experience' is the amount of energy involved.
<br>
<br>
You may want to refer to Robert Bruce's 'Astral Dynamics' for the lowdown on this but the jist is that during a near death experience the mind (and body) is mistaken into thinking that actual death has occured, therefor transfering huge amounts of (etheric) energy to the astral body. Of course, the individual has'nt died but gets to experience a hyper real obe, and a glimpse of what it is like when we leave our bodies behind for the last time.
<br>
<br>
In a conscious obe or phasing experience, where the individual is activly trying to bring on the experience, there is much less energy involved, hence many peoples interest in energy raising techniques (although some people have no problems with this area anyway).
<br>
<br>
To sum up, in a near death experience, the lucky individual gets to sample whats its like to be 'dead' in a physical sense, and the heightened sense of 'being alive' that goes with it. After experiencing this state, many people afterwards say that everyday physical awareness is like a half dead state in comparison. It makes you wonder just who is really 'dead'!
<br>
<br>
As for us trying to bring on such effects ourselves, the results are usually slightlty less striking but it is certainly possible with practice to achieve at least the same level of awareness as everyday life, if we practice enough.

<section>
Dear Nita,
<br>
<br>
Yes the signs are made of wood. I am very pleased and amazed about this! WOW!
<br>
<br>
Here is the latest experience:
<br>
<br>
Sunday morning. I woke up at 10:25 and decided to go to API. I started to do the triangle method, after a while i started to float over the ocean and i ended up to API. I looked at the signs first and tried to read them. I read the "to Pyramid" sign and entered the pyramid. The room was very solid this time. It was very real. There were doorways on the left and right walls. There were carvings on the opposite wall of the main entrance. The carvings looked like the eqyptian pictographic writings. In front of the opposite wall a man was standing. And a woman was standing next to the entrance. I took a look at the room on the right and the mummy was there so i decided to take a look at the other room. As i enter the room i saw a blackboard on the wall and a teacher with eyeglasses was giving a lesson. I looked around and i saw desks and students. It was a classroom. I sat one of the desks and tried to listen to the teacher. He was teaching about farming. He mentioned a big river. He told things about floods. I tried to talk to the students but they said "hush, listen to the lesson." I got out of the classroom and talked to the woman standing next to the door. I asked her name again and she said "stazz" then i said "never mind," I got out and walked to the right side. I saw a gray frozen man. I tried to wake him. I talked to him. I said "You should go deeper!" But i couldnt help. So I turned around and went to the dock. I saw someone next to the boat and he was frozen and gray too. I tried to wake him too but didnt work. So it was looking so real that i decided to enjoy the experiment and i started to examine the trees on the shore. Suddenly i saw a little boy sitting next to a tree. I said "Hi" and he said "Hi there" I said "What is your name?" He said "Andrea" I was suprised to understand his name. I said "Where are you from?" He said "Australia" I said "Are you a projector?" He said "No." I said "Are you living in the physical world?" He said "I lived once." I said "Why are you looking like a boy?" He said "Because, I want to look like this."I said can you help me to explore the island?" He said "Ok, lets go." We went to the frozen man on the shore. I tried to wake him again and I asked the boy about it. He said "No there is nothing you can do about him." I said "Why?" He said "He is not focused enough. He is in a lower level of conciousness." I said "Which focus level am i in now?" He said "Focus 27." I said "27?
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
Does Astral Pulse Island exist on Focus 27??" He said "No this place exists in all the planes. You are currently on level 27." I said "Why are you calling it 27?" He said "I am not. You understand what i am saying as Focus 27." I said "So that means your senses are different than my senses." He said "Yes. Some animals see the physical world black and white you know. But humans see in colors." I said "So which level is these frozen people?" He said "The one here is Focus 3 and the one over there is Focus 10. He is moving towards Focus 12 time to time as i see." I said "So I am seeing this place as i want to???" He said "Yes, your mind interprets the energy located here." I said "So i may not understand the things i had never seen before." He said "Not exactly. You may see a monster, but it can be someone hurt. He may be spreading negative energy around." I said "What do you see when you look at me?" A religious conversation started here. I dont want to share these conversations as they are very personal... But the last thing he said was "All of the religions point the same thing. The religions are tools for you to reach your goal." I said "What is the goal then?" He said "I would tell you but you wouldnt interpret it correctly. And I am forbidden to tell that." At that time my phone started to ring so the session had ended.

Brim....just wanted to thank you for posting your experiences with the API.  I continue to find encouragement in your posts.  I don't know if you read my attempt to reach the API, but I'm definitely getting closer.  I think my astral navigation is a little off right now, because I ended up going to some pyramid in Peru!

I am pleased you entered the pyramid. Nita had left some people there teaching things, it sounds as if there were some others Astral residents there as well. In fact, it sounds as if API could become a vacation place for Astral residents; that would be fun!
<br>
<br>
There seems to be people making it to the Island at a lower level of consciousness; if they are members here, it is only time before they level of consciousness matches API.

If you know anyone that doubts AP, you should have them read Birms post. It makes it VERY real!
<br>
<br>
Questions for Adrian and/or Birm:
<br>
<br>
How do we become residents of API? Do we have to die?
<br>
<br>
How did Nita put a teacher there? How was it done?
<br>
<br>
I plan on joining the Military, is there a way someone or me* I hope me* make a boot camp thing some place? That would be were I go 90% of the time.

  Brim....just wanted to thank you for posting your experiences with the API. I continue to find encouragement in your posts. I don't know if you read my attempt to reach the API, but I'm definitely getting closer. I think my astral navigation is a little off right now, because I ended up going to some pyramid in Peru!

Yes Jeff, I read your post and i have a few comments on it. Sometimes i end up on different islands or different places too. Whenever i realize that i am not on API, i start to float over the ocean again in order to find API. There are a lot of places to visit on the astral and API is just one of them.

  I am pleased you entered the pyramid. Nita had left some people there teaching things, it sounds as if there were some others Astral residents there as well. In fact, it sounds as if API could become a vacation place for Astral residents; that would be fun!
  <br>
  <br>
  There seems to be people making it to the Island at a lower level of consciousness; if they are members here, it is only time before they level of consciousness matches API.

Yes Adrian there are other astral residents there. This was an unexpected thing for me. I never thought i would meet with a deceased person there. It was also a very educational experience. Our Astral Locale is becoming popular. [

Hi All,
<br>
I went to the Island this afternoon,  my time, AEST....Night for most of you Americans.  And I was not sleeping at the time, I was just interested in going there to have a look.
<br>
<br>
Nice place you created, beautiful white sand and cool sea breezes.  I was to the left of the little dock and wrote with a stick in the sand..'Tay was here', couldn't help myself, LOL.[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
] I left the stick poking up out of the sand next to the 'T'.
<br>
<br>
Then I made my way to the little covered area, is that what is called a Cabanna ?  Sitting in a circle in the shade was a group of people, I finally got to meet Adrian and Nita, which was nice.  We all talked about the pyramid and how to bring it up to the way it was in it's pristine state with polished panels and internal workings etc.
<br>
<br>
After a while of sharing Loving energy I decided to go into the pyramid using it's original opening because I wanted to look at the four carved 'letters' under the Gable.  I finally got to run my fingers over them, that was a highlight for me.  Next I proceeded up the Grand Gallery to what is mis-named the King's Chamber and noticed that the stone trough (sarcophagus)was full of an energy and there was another door directly across from the Portcullis entrance, so I ventured up the steps to see what was in there.  What I saw was magnificent and I do not wish to describe it so as to not 'suggest' anything for other visitors to see.   But, it will really surprise you when you see it !!
<br>
<br>
I also discovered somethings on another part of the Island that sort of surprised me a little.  One being just how many visitors are arriving there, and many are not members of this forum.  Can't blame them though, it's got a nice feel about it already, just like any other holiday destination!  I could swear there was something like a Bar there, with people enjoying the atmosphere.  Maybe that was just my mind playing with itself, but it seemed very real at the time.
<br>
<br>
I carved something into one of the posts that hold up the roof of that little shady spot too, it is my sign.  You'd think I was over doing that kind of stuff at this age.  LOL.
<br>
<br>
Well that's my two cents worth again.
<br>
<br>
Love Always.

It would be nice if people did not talk too much about what modifications they did to the island so that other people won't be influenced by that...  It's a lot more interesting/amazing when people can tell what you did while you kept it secret.  What do you think about that?

Hey!
<br>
Were Adrian and Nita actually there at this time, what do you two have to say about this one?
<br>
<br>
If not then we have a case of astral constructs again, this time of real people; that might make things interesting when those people in question actually DO visit the island!

Yes, even if they don't consciously remember the experience, I would be curious to know what they may have been doing around that time.  If they were sleeping, or thinking about the API, I could conceive that there may have been some interaction with them on a deeper, subconscious level.
<br>
<br>
I say this because I've had many projections where I have had conversations with family members in my house when, in reality, they were not physically there.

Hi All,
<br>
I agree it would be nice if Adrian and Nita had a memory of the visit, it would serve the purpose of providing a proof that the Island is indeed a 'real' place.
<br>
<br>
The group that was sitting under the shade of that roof structure appeared to me as indistinct, shadow-like,  until I called out a specific greeting.  At that point one person stood up and introduced himself as Adrian.  He wore a long-sleeved shirt that was predominantly blue, I noticed that as we shook hands, although I do not recall seeing any other detail of him.  I said something very specific to him, so it will be interesting to see if he does have a memory of it.  He said, "And this is Nita", while pointing across to the other side of the group.  I saw a woman with darkish hair, between five foot three and five foot five tall, approximately.  It's a bit hard to guage the height as I was standing and she rose to say hello, although I am sure she was shorter than me,  As far as most males go I am short, around five foot six.
<br>
<br>
What I did notice was that the structure was like something from Gilligan's Island!  Complete with table and bench seating.  Not sure if that is what is really there, it's just what i saw.
<br>
<br>
The reason I left my 'tag' on the beach sand and on one post of the little structure was to provide proofs for my experiment with travelling there.  So if anyone else sees them and can describe which post and what the specific sign is that I carved on it, then we have proofs.  It's my logical, scientific mind looking for the proofs, so please indulge me if you will, LOL.
<br>
<br>
After investigating the Pyramid I went to what you could call the back of the Island (from the view of looking at the picture provided on the site)and at some time during that I fell asleep, so anything that came after that may be nothing more than dream/fantasy, ie:- the thing that seemed to be a Bar with people enjoying the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to reading what others have to say on their adventures to this lovely Island.
<br>
<br>
Love Always.[

<br>
P.S.  I have just had an interesting thought.  The next time I go I will take the form of a very specific Archetype, and choose a colour that would not normally be associated with it.n  Then there will be no doubting if anyone sees it.[

Hello Tayesin

You are correct that I was on the island and yes there is a cabana like something from Gilligans Island. It is a modification that was made by me so I had somewhere to sit. I am about 5ft 5 inches tall and I do have dark hair.

Last night after seeing this thread I decided I was going to attempt to reach API, I layed there in bed trying to imagine myself reaching the island and I remembered there was a dock, so I imagined myself approaching the island in a boat - within my mind the boat kept changing until it was a pretty decent boat [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
]. Anyway I ended up falling to sleep and dreaming about something or other. What happened this morning was great, I was basically in the dream and it was the usual where you dont realise you're in a dream and then I started to wake up from it and BAM! I was on my boat heading towards API and this time I was conscious of what was happening, I reached the dock and departed the boat and as I stepped onto the beach it wasnt really a beach, it was sort of part sand part grass and I thought to myself this aint right and imagined a golden beach and WAM! suddenly the beach changed to this golden beach, I remember thinking about what someone said about writing their name in the sand near the dock with a stick and was going to take a look but didnt because I wanted to get to the pyramid. I headed towards to Pyramid to see if I could look inside and as I got closer I suddenly appeared within the pyramid possibly near the entrance - before me was this great long stretch of corridor and on each side of the corridor were doors and doors and more doors - I headed down the corridor looking in each of the room but there wasn't really much in them to be honest or at least nothing I can remember, there were people in the corridor, some were ordinary folk but some were sort of like zombies, they wernt all there if you know what I mean as though they wernt aware of their surroundings - I didnt try and speak to them because I was too interested in exploring the pyramids rooms - I apprached what I think was the centre of the pyramid because at this point the corridor broke into a fork, a corridor to my north east and a corridor to my north west so to speak. I didnt go down them because I noticed a door on my left and a door on my right, I remeber they had signs on the doors, the one on my right was a CCTV camera room and a sign on the door either said out of order or no entry - but me being who I am, entered the room, I attempted to get the cctv to work and it came on I was trying to see what was on the screen but then I awoke in my bed, my mother had woken me up (even though im off work the week and wanna lay in!!).
<br>
<br>
Now personally even though it was very vivid and I was 'conscious' of the whole thing and thought of the Astral pulse etc etc I think it was likely just a lucid dream, from what has been said from those who have already been inside of the pyramid it is different from what I experienced ie. I never encountered a school etc.
<br>
But it was a great experience none the less. I hope one day to actually get there. [|)]

I want to remind the projectors about one thing. When you enter the pyramid try to exit en re-enter. Because you may end up in a different place when you enter. I dont know the reason but sometimes when i enter and exit i find myself in a different place. But When i exit if i find myself in the island i can be sure that i entered the right pyramid.

<section>
Birm, anything can be connected to anything in astral. Somebody else who entered the pyramid could have thought about that different place you went. The more links from A to B, or A to C to Z to B, the more likeley you will go to B if you start at A. If there was an A to K and a D to K, and you were thinking about A and D, you would be more likely to go to K than B.
<br>
<br>
If you find a path from A to M to N to O and back to A, then next time you can go from A straight to O. If you didnt find your way back, you have to store the memories in chain, and any break in the chain can make you forget. This way you can build a network of connected energies that you can go to, which makes it more real.

I just want to say thank you to you guys for creating a place where a newbie can work the kinks out of his/her O.B.E.'ing skills.  And as soon as I can go where I "want" to go to I'll point my way to this island as it is, everytime I try I end up somewhere else, the last time I did, I think I got close, I was in water, deep, dark water, so I imagined a raft, that raft started grow (as I am afraid of deep, dark water in real life) untill it became a bigger boat, about twenty feet long with robots rowing for me and a couple main sails.  I finally bumped into an island but all the while I was in calm seas and deep fog, I couldn't see more than probably two hundred yards in front of me at the most.  so I felt like I was being wrapped up in it.  Next time, I might have more success. Then again, it might have been a VERY lucid dream, who knows...lol!

Hi there,
<br>
<br>
I had two seperate experiences in the last weekend.
<br>
<br>
On my first experience with API i was shocked! There were two islands! You could see one from the other. I thought i was in a wrong place so i blacked out conciously and tried to deepen my conciousness after then i travelled back. But there were two islands again!!! I landed on the first one. It was crowded. There was a group people sitting on the sands. And there were a lot of writings on the sands. I fly over the island and looked at the other one. It was the same island with the pyramid. I travelled to the second island, landed on the sands. It looked more solid to me. Everything was looking like the picture. I looked at the pyramid door. It was closed. I travelled to the first island again. I looked at the pyramid door and this one was open. So i decided to talk to someone. I stood next to a man and said "Hello", He said "Hi", then suddenly i found myself in my room. I was in Real time zone. This man was standing next to me in my room. I got confused. I talked with the man but i dont remember about the conversation now.
<br>
<br>
The second experience is as follows: I laid on my bed and started the triangle method. I had the intention to deepen the trance state as far as i could in order to get a better view. I had doubts about the last experience. After 15 minutes i started to hear voices. I concentrated on the voices i realized someone was talking to me. I started talking with the voice. We started to talk in turkish. I realized that i was translating the answers to english. The voice asked "Why are you repeating me?" I said i want to remember this conversation after the projection. The voice said "it is ok" I thought i might be talking to myself and i decided to travel to API. As i arrive i saw the two islands again. I said "I am doing something wrong!" I went to the first island and saw those people there again. I saw a cabin on the right side of the island. I travelled to the second island again and pyramid door was closed. And nobody was there. I went back to the first island. I looked for Andrea. (I met with him before on API.) I found him and asked "What happened here?" He said "This usually happens..." I said "What are you doing here." He said "My job is to wait here." I said "Are you waiting the island?" He said "Yes. I keep track of the changes." I said "There is an island over there." He said "Yes they made it a while ago." I said "It is crowded here" He said "This usually happens in the astral. Some places become popular time to time." I said "I have to go, i have got some work to do." He said "See you later." I got up to write the experience down.

Well on the first island my sight was never clear enough to identify the people or entities clearly. Only the cabin was solid. There were writings on the sands but they were unreadable. But on the new island everything was clear and real.

I just made my first visit to API today. I hadn't read this thread in awhile, but I went back and read the last few pages to catch up. I'm not sure how much of my experience 'jives' with others, but I'll post what I experienced:
<br>
<br>
Went deeper into meditation. I began to visualize the island. I'm then flying over the ocean approaching it. I step onto the sand, its a white sand. I look around, but don't sense/see anyone else. I walk out onto the dock and look out over the ocean. I can barely see a reef under the water. I turn around and walk back onto the beach. I perceive a small, round hut type thing on the edge of the trees and beach. I don't sense any walls, but somehow I sense the roof. Its made of dried palm leaves.
<br>
<br>
I walk through the trees to the pyramid. I float up along the walls of the pyramid and the sides feel rough and rocky. I go up to the very top of the pyramid, and I sense the sides along the top are smoother. I also get the impression of hyroglyphs on this part. I can't see them well, but I sense a pretty blue color in them. I look down over the island, then glide down the side and back onto the ground.
<br>
<br>
I look around again and don't sense anyone. I then yell out "Is anyone there!" But I don't sense an answer. Then I yell "Novice is here". But again, I don't sense any response.
<br>
<br>
I look at the side of the pyrmaid I'm facing, but I don't see an entrance. I go towards my right and sense that there's an opening there. I walk inside and get the feeling that its dimly lit, not bright at all. I think there may have been steps leading slightly upwards, but I couldn't get a good 'read' on it. I didn't feel like I was getting anything clearly. I exit and walk back out onto the beach. I went back to the small hut type thing and made something under it. We'll see if anyone sees/senses it.
<br>
<br>
I then walked to the edge of the water and yelled out that I was leaving. But again, I didn't get any response.

Just make sure there're people you trust and can talk to in your life -- parents, teachers, a counselor, etc. You don't have to tell them what you're doing, but people like that can help you stay grounded and healthy while you're exploring yourself and beyond yourself. You might get more than you bargained for if you keep at it. But it's worth it, and lots of fun too.

I'm sure your tutor would say the same thing about reincarnation and near death experiences.  Well, check out this link to read all kinds of Biblical support for paranormal experiences:

Sometimes during an oobe/Astral projection it is possible for your consciousness to experience premenitions/witness possible future events or your astral self to even traverse time itself but it is also possible to have these occurences when in deep meditation (except the actually visiting the future part) - if you passed out your brainwaves may have altered to the state similar to that of someone in a deep trance allowing for your experience.

It doesnt really mean anything in regards to how is your best way to AP. Id strongly suggest you attempt all techniques available until you find one which best suits you and which you feel you are getting more from. Once you feel you've found your best technique continue trying from there.
<br>
Personally the rope technique for me doesnt do anything whatsoever but there are many who managed to have their first ever AP by using that method.
<br>
My advice to you would be to experiment with as many different techniques as you can.

<section>
I would just like to add one note to Hephaestus' recommendation about trying as many techniques as you can. Don't just try each one only once or twice. I would pick one and use it consistently for at least 30 days and see what results, if any, you obtain. If you feel opimistic with that, then continue. If not, then switch to another technique.
<br>
<br>
I only say this because I've seen some people post about getting frustrated after only a few days. You can't gauge something after that short a period of time.
<br>
<br>
Good luck.

Last Saturday afternoon I had an unexpected trip to the Astral Island Local. When I lucid dream I usually cannot control where I go or what I do. This particular time I swam to shore. It was dark. I thought I had arrived on the island. I climbed a rock to come to shore. I looked at the rock backing up from it, seeing it as the observer . It was two large wet boulders. It must have been the wrong place.
<br>
Later I'm flying, my hair is wet. I sighted the astral local below. I recognized the vivid color of the pyramid. I landed. Now I'm watching myself walk up to the pyramid. I was in my mental body (vivid skin tone), had sandles and a short white sandstone colored skirt or wrap. I wasn't able to see above my waist. Approaching the pyramid taking a couple steps upward is all I can remember. I was standing by one of the corners.

If you can't create things in the astral, then how do you think astral things got to be there in the first place?  In other words, if I astral project into a garden, then where did all the astral plants come from?
<br>
<br>
I agree with veliki.  If you create something in the astral, it's every bit as "real" as you make it.  In my opinion, there is no such thing as something with isn't real, because if it can be imagined, then it already has some sort of realness to it.  As an example, the monster under the bed may not be "Real" to an adult, but it's certainly "real" to the child.
<br>
<br>
From my own experiences, I look at astral creations in this aspect.  If I create, say, a chair with my mind, and then I sit on it, it's real.  Does that mean that everyone else may see that chair?  Well, if they are in the same room, then the answer is quite possible yes.
<br>
<br>
Now, if I told them to project to that chair from another location, they may not find it, because it is something I just created, with no connection to anything else.
<br>
<br>
Now take the Astral Pulse Island, for example.  This is a place, concentrated on by HUNDREDS of people, fixating on it in their minds, imagining all the details of this island.  As it is thought, so it is created.  The more people who believe in it, the more "real" it becomes, and the more permanent it will last.  This is how belief system terrorites are created (pearly gates, hell, etc).
<br>
<br>
This is all my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.  It's just what I've come to believe based on my experiences.

Astral realm is one higher way of existance, higher than physical, create things in astral is easier than in physical world, (just with thoughts) but this does not mean that created things are not real. They are not only real for me who was a creator, they are real for every man who is projected to astral, but what is imagination of creation stronger things in astral remais longer!  Oh its a rhyme!

If I could recount all of the things in my life that are real, conditions, people, etc...that started out as thoughts, stories my mom and I made up and kept talking about through my life, ideas, images I held in my mind, dreams, longings....

bottom line is: the things people and places that exist in my everyday life all started out as a thought, as conciousness...

Actually it would be pretty cool to have a waterfall down one (or more) of the sides of the pyramid. Perhaps even down the entrance and it could split in two and fall either side of the doorway or something. Just a though [

I'm surprised at how quiet API talk has gotten. A few weeks ago people were raving about it and now it hardly seems like anybody is talking about it at all. Do people still visit regularly?

An idea for those who can project but cant find/reach the Astral Pulse Island.
<br>
When you project request your higher self to give you a map to get from your location to the AP Island - I have no idea what will happen but it may help. [

I think I might have gone to AP Island last night.
<br>
<br>
I was with two of my guides, I didn't plan to go there, my guide took me there. We arrived at night and walked onto the beach. There was a wooden shack/building. It was sort of like a bar/cafe place. There was a sign above it which said Astral Pulse something? I didn't get the last word. There were about 20 or so people there. We sat down together then a younger goodlooking guy and an older guy came and sat down with us. We chatted about how beautiful it was there. I remember very clearly seeing this tribal guy dancing in the middle of the room...he had tatoos on his face..curves with dots around them. I asked who he was, the older guy said he always hung out there. He looked like he was straight out the jungle...really indigenous sort of person.
<br>
<br>
Anyone ever seen anything like this?...I'm still reading this thread, so sorry if this is a stupid question.

I had an experience where someone may have been asking me about API.  This morning I had 5 very short LD's that I kept phasing in and out of.  Then I became conscious and thought I was in the physical lying in bed because everything looked the same and I could feel the covers over me just like normal.  Then someone I couldn't see came up behind me and grabbed my hands which then started vibrating and they said something about island music and I think they asked me if I wanted to go to the island and I thought they meant API at the time.
<br>
<br>
I still was thinking I was in the physical because of how real it was and I started slowly floating across the bed which startled me and it ended.  I'm not sure if this was an LD or someone trying to take me to API or maybe some other place but it was the first time in a while that I didn't panic and screw up a AP or LD when it came on.  Edit: I just realized that I may have been pulled out by someone because I started sliding across the bed after hearing the voice and having my hands grabbed.

Its quite possable that a helper, permanant resident of the Non Physical environment, or Part of your higherself what I would call a guide was trying to help you get out of your body. Have you been thinking about visiting the Island a lot?. Its sounds like you were so close but just got a little excited.
<br>
<br>
I have read so many accounts that have this same type of experience described. Sounds like your doing great! good luck and remember there is nothing to be afraid of, If for some reason you get scared just project the feeling of love at whatever is scaring you and that should take care of it.

First off, I want to say this sounds really cool and that I encourage this.  I haven't obed (although I have lucid dreamed) yet, but this will be my first destination when I do the next of either.
<br>
<br>
I'm curious about something though.  I can understand the idea of the island existing because of all the hundreds of people focusing on the island.  However, there is a problem with leaving a mark on the island and that's that there is only person thinking on that object.  Wouldn't that make leaving and verifying signs left on the island rather difficult?  If 100s of people are needed to solidify the island, then you might need quite a few people to solidify signs too?  Just wondering.  Or do signs get a sort of extra permenence because they exist in the same realm?

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
Thought it time to introduce myself and wish you all well. I am one of those slack people who has been lurking the site since off an on for about 5 odd years now, but have put a few posts in of late. You certainly have built a great place here and wonderful rapport with each other. I for one have not consciously projected for some time as I had been working on other aspects of development, but was lucky enough to attend the Buckland Hall workshop last year!
<br>
<br>
I have been quite a number of semi-lucid dreams of late with only some minor control, but had remembered what I thought just to be a silly one within the last week or so.
<br>
<br>
I found myself at a beach bar which had a big Astral Pulse sign. There seemed to be other people there. They all looked like they were well pleased to be there (a few grins had)! Can't remember much more than that sorry to say! So on awaking I had let the memory go, because I had thought that perhaps I was overdoing my interest in the AP site generally. Let me know if am on the wrong track on this one or not? Either way it's a good lesson to learn from. Perhaps catch you there sometime (if I can remember that is).
<br>
<br>
Wishing you all well the project!
<br>
<br>
Cheers for now,
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stephen

  Greetings everyone,
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a copy of a post from another topic, in which I have introduced a concept that I have been considering for quite some time. Actually it is more than a mere concept, as I am very confident that it would function as planned. It does of course require considerable planning, and hence this new topic for initial discussion purposes. Accordingly, all comments, contributions and ideas are most welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here is my original proposal:
  <br>
  <br>
  I have been contemplating the concept of the "Astral locale" meeting place for quite some time, have researched it, and I am quite sure it could work very well indeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  I don't want to go into too many details at this juncture, but it would work something like this.
  <br>
  <br>
  We would find (perhaps with the help of people here) a first rate graphic artist to create an Astral locale as a detailed graphic which would be posted here in the forums under a project topic created for the purpose. We can all have a say in the construction and features. The Astral locale would anyway need to be very carefully thought out, and have a varied and interesting selection fo features such diverse features as meeting places and "doorways" to other realms, e.g. the realms of the Elements, as well as a portal for other parts of the Astral. Beyond that, we are quite literally only limited by the imagination, and the skills of the graphic artist.
  <br>
  <br>
   The very creation of the locale itself will give it an initial Astral presence - everything created in the imagination is created in the Astral initially - but usually only transiently. The graphic would be posted here as the reference point for phasing - similar to the imagery of the Monroe tapes, except we would all us the same imagery - the Astral locale.
   <b>
    Everyone
   </b>
   can participate in this! Those that can phase already will be able to phase to the locale in the Astral and meet with others. Those that cannot yet phase will start with a sort of meditation, which will consist of a degree of relaxation, while keeping the image in mind while imagining travelling and being there. After mentally arriving the traveller would mentally walk around the locale, observe the features and meet and communicate with others. Soon enough, a simple mental presence will be achieved which might or might not be perceivable by the other participants. Over time however, with repeated practice, the mental presence will become stronger and stronger, and soon become a full Astral phased presence perceivable by all present at the locale at the time. As more and more people participate, the Astral locale will become more and more "solid" and permanent, and more and more energetic. This is how locales are created by the Astral residents themselves - repeated use of a created locale gives it permanency.
   <br>
   <br>
   This will not only provide the possibility for a shared Astral experience, but at the same time provide those that cannot yet phase the focal point and motivation to succeed, and supported by everyone else. Experiences and notes can be compared here. The doorways and portals can then be used for onward exploration. I think this would provide a multitude of purposes, including but not limited to assisting people in the phasing process, providing a meeting place, and performing group activities such as retrievals and exploration. I would hope that it would be possible to attract the presence of permanent Astral residents - helpers, guides and many others. It could also be potentially used as a place for meeting deceased relatives, friends and loved ones, by incorporating the methods of Bruce Moen and his friends.
   <br>
   <br>
   I would be interested to get some feedback on this idea.
   <br>
   <br>
   With best regards,
   <br>
   <br>
   Adrian.

<section>
I tried to visit again last night after a failed attempt on 10/4.
<br>
<br>
I wasn' able to exit, since the energy I use to project was too low, but I did get soem snapshots of the island through phasing.
<br>
<br>
I was on ground level looking from the sea. Too low to see the pyramid. I had the impression I was looking at a very quiet section of th island. Atleast, there was noone on the beach nor any structures. The only thing that stood out was a sandbank around 40 feet from the shore in the sea. Like a a little island around 20 feet in diameter. Would be nice to hear if someone else has seen it too.

<section>
Yes, this Island is very useful. I haven't been able to project, but in meditations and visualizations, I have found that API is easy to visualize, and very relaxing very quickly. A big thank you to those who have been developing this place, and to Birm for sharing his experiences as well as the Triangle method!
<br>
<br>
I am also interesting in visiting API as soon as I am capable, and until that time, will continue to imagine it during meditations. I don't know whether anything like this is real or not, but it's certainly worth the effort.
<br>
<br>
I'd also like to ask about the island bar. Before I ever visited this website, I had a lucid dream that I was on a tropical island, and I was sitting at a table. It was an outside bar area, and I watched the bartender mix drinks (I also tasted them, and they tasted wonderful). Anyway, the bartender was dressed in a Kool-Aid pitcher suit, but when she took it off, she was a young woman, dark hair. Any likeness here, or just another dream?
<br>
<br>
Also, for the further dispursion of the API image, what about creating desktop themes? I know it's not too difficult to do, and there are plenty of desktops to theme (Mac, Windows, Linux [which includes Gnome, KDE, Window Maker, etc.]). I prefer Window Maker, and will be making a theme at least for personal use.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, hello to everyone and good fortune!

Phew! After 3 hours of reading I have finally read it all! Now, I browse these forums from time to time and usually I read about OBEs. I myself am a noobie in all this (meditation, metaphysics, OBE, AP...), I started with meditation and that's what I am doing right now. I have always wanted to AP, and try it (a little) each evening, so far I got only some 3 lucid dreams, which were pale and too realistic (I couldn't punch through walls and fly, I dunno why, but I knew it was a dream). From now on, I will train AP a lot more often, because I just want to feel it! I usually try The Triangle method and hear that sound, but no projection [}:)] I know I should not be in a hurry and everything has it's time, but anyway, I will do the following things:
<br>
1) Make that beautiful island my wallpaper.
<br>
2) Think about most of the time, so maybe I see it in a dream.
<br>
3) Read that AP manual by Bruce.
<br>
<br>
Yeah, well, wait me there! I am really a noobie, so maybe someone could give me a hand with those AP (help me get more into it, leave my body, you know [

anyways, i was first having a normal average dream and then i kinda wake out of it, and into sleep paralysis. then i decide to breath deeply and after a few seconds i rose out of my body, i also had a little trouble getting out but that's because im still very new to this. anyways, when i got out i was in this weird building.. i don't remember it 100% but i do remember that there were guards and it had the company's name on almost any wall. but it was so weird there i don't think it actually existed, maybe just my imagination actually this is why im not sure if it was real. then after i got extremely bored of the place i thought of leaving and tried to go to anywhere but there. next thing i saw was me flying to API. when i got there, i didn't see the front door so i decided to walk around. and i met these two people sun tanning or relaxing or something. anyways i politely said hello and they replied but then i said i needed to find the entrance of the pyramid and walked away. funny thing is, behind the entrance on the other side of the island things looked like they were made out of putty or clay, and it was messed up. at that moment i wasn't sure weather is was a dream or not. anyways, i decided to walk some more towards the entrance and i got there. i knew why i missed it and that's because there was a big line of trees covering it outside the pyramid. when i got inside it was a little creepy, there was a mummy statue with chains wrapped all over his body, and it seemed to be alive. also there was a lady in there, who i asked how long i could stay in the pyramid and she said just  about 5 minutes so decided to look inside the rooms. i only got through about 3 i think(cant remember well what's in them). and then i woke up or returned to my body, and when i got up out of bed i felt a little weird, like minor vibrations.
<br>
<br>
reasons why i think it may have been a dream is because the island and pyramid didnt seem real at all. infact lots of things felt out of place like the clay in te back, and even some of the people i talked to didn't seem very real... but there are other reasons that point to that it was an obe, so im confused [B)]
<br>
<br>
well, that's most of it, and im still not sure if it was a dream or not, if anyone who's been to the island can tell me that i was wrong about the island, or if i matched the description, it would be most helpful. also, if anyone could tell me why or why not it was an OBE then that would be great too![

<section>
My two cents:  It could have been a lucid dream AND an OBE.  Depending on your experience, ability to focus and energy level, you could shift back and forth between consensual experiences and your individual dream experiences without really knowing it.  You don't have to rise out of your physical body to go to the astral plane, you can also "shift" into it without going into the real time plane.  It would be hard to check what experiences were subjective and what were objective (that is, to prove to yourself you had an objective experience in API you would have to find someone who saw you there, or observe details of the island that match what other people have independently observed) but not impossible.  Another possibility (if you had a lot of control) is to befriend a disincarnate entity (i.e., ex-human) who you could visit time and again, and who could explain to you what you did last time you saw them.  Just thought I'd throw out a couple of observations/opinions.  Good luck!

Alright. Please bear with me if I skip over things said before, because although I've been visiting these forums for years, I never noticed this thread in a major way and I can't bring myself to read 18 pages of posts about it (I know... lazy... I got through like the first 6, though!).
<br>
<br>
My proposal is this. I can immediately begin work (as in, tomorrow) on the astral locale as a 3-d walkthrough game. If all you artists out there help me with the textures and skins, I can go that much faster. If not, I can always use the .wad files from counter-strike [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
] Anyhow, I've had experience programming in DirectX(windows' 3-d engine, universally used and easily obtained) and C++ as well as, back in the DAY, DarkBASIC. Anyhow, I decided to bring it up because though I thought of it before, I never really realized how plausible the idea was before I saw a post in the General Metaphysics area.
<br>
<br>
Making a game of mostly movement will be a simple task at worst. I'm a somewhat advanced 3-d artist in Milkshape3D, and Valve Hammer, both of which can be incorporated by DirectX for both levels and entities. The idea is that a "game" can give a much better impression of an area than pictures ever could, and the best part is that your brain fills in the details! I'm sure that since the graphics you see on the screen go through your imagination and subconscious before the thought waves reach the astral location, the actual location won't look polygonal and blocky at all, and most members here who don't have top of the line computers won't have to worry about having computers good enough to run things like vertex shading and such.
<br>
<br>
The inherent problem I've seen time and time again is that people think they're getting to the island, without actually doing it. It's a problem I thought of as soon as I saw the concept of the island. I have several proposals for ways to get around it (which I also posted in a sister post in the General Metaphysics forum).
<br>
<br>
Firstly, a beacon of some sort to guide wayward projectors TO the island. Since the subconscious can make up the locale itself, I'm sure it could also (accidentally?) imitate a beacon to the place. Thus, the beacon would have to be rooted to the real world. So what sort of real-world objects do we have that interact with the astral? Why, crystals, of course!
<br>
<br>
Several (or many!) similarly attuned crystals could be used to guide wayfarers to the island. The obvious choice (should anyone decide to support me in this venture) would be to have me attune the crystals and somehow distribute them to the Astral Pulse members. Concerns of cost aside, I'm sure people don't want to post addresses to the forum, so a trustworthy 3rd party (perhaps a moderator like Adrian or Nick) could maintain the list via PM. In this manner, a person could receive a crystal from the member who just had it, attune their own crystals to that one (or just go for a one-time joyride) and then send it on to the next. That way, the person who received the crystal only gets the address of the person they are to send it to next. I don't think of the people on this forum, generally, as being untrustworthy, but the reason I'd only like to send a few out is that if someone turns out to be a jerk, it's not an enormous investment lost. I don't mind giving something from my own wallet to support a venture such as this. Anyway, it's just one suggestion.
<br>
<br>
The other suggestion would be hypnotism! Since your mind has the capacity to create a "shadow" version of the API, it's definitely got to have the ability also to transport you there. If a member of the forums skilled in hypnotism (perhaps the user, "Hypnotist"?) could create an audio track of some sort and make it available for download, it would give everyone a relatively pain-free way of increasing their chances of success. By being very specific about the locale in the hypnotism, I'm SURE it would be possible to ensure your phasing goes according to plan!
<br>
<br>
So let me know what you think! I think the thought form of a game would be much different than that of a picture. You're not just appreciating art, you're interacting, a step closer to the environment and I bet that would translate into stronger materialization on the astral. This is my way of trying to get involved in this project. If I skipped over something and we already have an astral locale that people can reliably get to, I'm sorry, I can edit the post or whatever. But I think the things I have mentioned can have a higher chance of success, which is what we're shooting for, than those I've read about!

I haven't been here in a while due to Astral Pulses downtime. Cheyyne your ideas are extremely exciting and exactly what the Astral Local/other shared meeting places in the astral need. Unfortunately the steam seems to have gone out of the effort on this project a tad.
<br>
<br>
I'm the webmaster at the Lucid Crossroads (or Astral Crossroads depending how you choose to visit), click my website button, which is a long term shared thats been going over two years now and is constantly developing. I'd like to integrate (join up) the Astral Local more firmly into what we do over there.
<br>
<br>
We would love your skills over at the Crossroads... I believe all efforts on the sharing of disparate people around the globes mobilities of consciousness should be pooled into a greater effort.

Thats a good idea Cheyyne.
<br>
It would be more interesting if this "game" had multi-player support, where you could connect a bunch of users over the Internet.
<br>
That would be interesting to see if people in the astral world, could cause changes noticeable in the game world. You wouldn't necessarily need a multi-player game for that, but it would add a bit to the fun factor.

Won't the BrainWave Generator be a good tool for self Hypnotisim? Then in your mind while lying down you could just repeat in your head over and over "Mind stay up and leave the body".  Well, I haven't been able to use this method to Astral Project yet, but it helped when I was studying for a test.

I don't have much experience with the BWGen. I assume it would be a good tool if someone has the skills necessary to create the correct frequencies. I don't know if I am going to actually make the game if only a few people are interested, I was extremely tired that night and was being very optimistic at the time. In any case, I still believe the hypnotism and crystal ideas are very plausible.

Hi folks,
<br>

<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
.  I was so thrilled to find a group of people that have explored this idea of an astral meeting place...I've been looking for a place like that.  Is it open to any curious projector or is it invitation only? Does anyone have pics of what the inside of the pyramid looks like, or what some of the outside meeting places look like?  The one picture I saw is kind of dense, it would be helpful to visualize a more open area, like a wide beach, or an area cleared between the palm trees.  Thanks!

wow I'm a newbie here. I have been striving for astral travel for almost 4 years now, to mild success but never intended and full sustained astral travel! Would this really work, I mean say i was to come would i meet you people if you were astral travelling to?. also lets say off shore of this island i built a small fishing boat, would all you guys be able to see that without me telling you it were there. And lets say I entered the locale without ever posting on here would i be able to get to know you guys and then come on here and you would know who i was with some cues?
<br>
<br>
Soo many questions and as all ways when first seeing hope of success it seems like soo little time.

I've tried that. I repeated to myself 3 times aloud "Mind awake, body asleep" then I said aloud "I will remember!" three times. I just kept thinking "mind awake, body asleep" in my head several times, and pretty soon I got the sleep paralysis and floated out. ^_^ It works for me.

What is the true reason for all to question but not attempt. If your mind has gotten to a point where you need to answer such questions, then your time is what you make it. Astral projection comes with practice and challenges. Letting go is most of the first step, then letting yourself know without knowing. Understand it is much like a muscle. The more you exercise the stronger it gets. You can find anything you would like if you take your time and use it wisely. Keep it in mind for as much as you can handle, and it will develop

This is very similar to the Locale that is on the Astral that is visited by the Rosicrucians of A.M.O.R.C (Ancient Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis) where I attained the tenth degree under Dr. Ralph Lewis; Shortly after this I also joined the Confraternity of the Rose Cross under the tutelage of Gary Stewart where i attained the Tenth degree also. How many others here nave been in AMORC or other Rosicrucian Orders? I still go here on occasion to re-charge my batteries.
