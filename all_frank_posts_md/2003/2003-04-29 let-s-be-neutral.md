<section>
well... supposively if we were well-informed enough on any topic, we should form an opinion. if you have no opinion, you don't know enough about the topic to form one.
<br>
<br>
for example..
<br>
<br>
say someone came up to you and told you there were 2 girls arguing over the last piece of candy in a bag about 1000 miles away. then say they asked 'which of them should get it?'.. you wouldnt care most likely. or youd say you didnt know. but if you knew whod already eaten to most, you might form an opinion based on your beliefs.
<br>
<br>
thats the general idea, though its on a really small scale.

Nobody can be "neutral" ALL the time...in fact the idea of being "neutral" is just an illusion.
