Singapore Gives Five Stars to Toilet
<br>

<br>
SINGAPORE - Singapore's environment minister awarded the country's first five-star rating to a public restroom on Tuesday, at the start of a nationwide drive to flush out dirty lavatories.
<br>
<br>
Environment Minister Lim Swee Say launched the "Happy Toilet" campaign, which will rate public restrooms using a five-star system similar to that used for hotels.
<br>
<br>
"I am looking very forward to experiencing this toilet myself so I can walk out of the toilet feeling happy," Lim said at a news conference, before placing the award plaque outside a restroom at a suburban shopping mall in the wealthy Southeast Asian city-state.
<br>
<br>
"In total we spend almost three years of our lives on the toilet. It's natural and it's normal, so let's learn to say: 'Wow! That's a great toilet!" Sim said in the Happy Toilet program booklet.
<br>
<br>
This tightly controlled tropical island nation of 4 million people is known for its behavior modification campaigns, which have included anti-spitting drives and media blitzes aimed at making people more courteous.
