<br>
Dyslexia is hard to spell. Abbreviation is such a long word. There is no ham in hamburger and neither pine nor apple in a pineapple. French fries were not invented in France. Quicksand takes you down slowly. Boxing rings are square, and a guinea-pig is neither from Guinea nor a pig.
<br>
<br>
If a vegetarian eats vegetables then what to humanitarians eat? Why do people recite at a play, yet play at a recital? If people from Poland are called Poles, then why aren't people from Holland called Holes?
<br>
<br>
Do infants enjoy infancy as much as adults enjoy adultery? Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker? Why is a person who plays the piano a pianist, but a person who drives a racing-car not a racist?
<br>
<br>
If lawyers are disbarred and clergymen defrocked, can electricians be delighted? Musicians denoted? Cowboys deranged? Fashion models deposed, and cleaners depressed?
<br>
<br>
Why are wise men and wise guys opposites? If horrific means to make horrible, why doesn't terrific mean to make terrible? And why is it when I wind-up my watch it starts, yet when I wind-up a story it ends?

Asking humans to be consistent is like asking a monkey to do calculus. Whoever made this language are retards.
<br>
<br>
The main problems with english are:
<br>
silent letters
<br>
(whore should be spelled hor)
<br>
multiple definitions for 1 word
<br>
(Burn all fags could mean burn homosexuals or cigarettes)
<br>
multiple words for 1 definition
<br>
(I'm going to take a excrement, a dump, a crap, a load...)

i don't think it's as much of english being a language created by idiots as it is english words being created by.. unique people.

English was created by people with all to many sharp implements and amazingly short tempers in a time when the implements were considered valid arghuments (sic) and could be used to prove a point.

Greetings Frank,
<br>
<br>
That was very funny! [8D] Something else again is how the English language isn't always translated quite the way it should be.
<br>
<br>
These are actual signs translated in English (but not exactly as they thought)
<br>
<br>
From a Japanese Hotel:
<br>
<br>
"It is forbidden to steal towels please. If you are not person to do such thing please not read notes. -You are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid. -Please do not bath inside the tub."
<br>
<br>
A few more:
<br>
Acapulco: "The manager has personally passed all water served here."
<br>
<br>
Thailand notice for donkey riders: "Would you like to ride on your own butt?"
<br>
<br>
Rome laundry: "Leave your clothes here and spend the afternoon having a good time."
<br>
<br>
Zurich hotel: "Because of the unpropriety of entering guests of the opposite sex in the bedroom, it is suggested that the lobby be used for this purpose."
<br>
<br>
Swiss restaurant menu: "Our wines leave nothing to hope for."
<br>
<br>
and finally,
<br>
<br>
Copenhagen airline office: "We take your bags and send them in all directions."
<br>

LMAO Nick

I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said "Stop! Don't do it!" He said "Why shouldn't I?".
<br>
<br>
I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!" He said, "Like what?"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Well, are you religious or atheist?" He said, "Religious."
<br>
<br>
I said, "Me too! Are you Christian or Buddhist?" He said, "Christian."
<br>
<br>
I said, "Me too! Are you Catholic or Protestant?" He said, "Protestant."
<br>
<br>
I said, "Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?" He said, "Baptist!"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist church of god or Baptist church of the lord?" He said, "Baptist church of god!"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Me too! Are you original Baptist church of god, or are you reformed Baptist church of god?" He said, "Reformed Baptist church of god!"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Me too! Are you reformed Baptist church of god, reformation of 1879, or reformed Baptist church of god, reformation of 1915?" He said, "Reformed Baptist church of god, reformation of 1915!"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Die, heretic scum", and pushed him off.

My friends,
<br>
<br>
English is bad, but help is on the way.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; The European Union commissioners have announced that an agreement
<br>
&gt;&gt; has been reached to adopt English as the preferred language for
<br>
&gt;&gt; European communications, rather than German, which was the other
<br>
&gt;&gt; possibility.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; As part of the negotiations, the British government conceded that
<br>
&gt;&gt; English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a
<br>
&gt;&gt; five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro
<br>
&gt;&gt; for short).
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; In the first year, "s" will be used instead of the soft "c".
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve this news with joy.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Also, the hard "c" will be replased with "k". Not only will this
<br>
&gt;&gt; klear up konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the
<br>
&gt;&gt; troublesome "ph" will be replaced by "f". This will make words like
<br>
&gt;&gt; "fotograf" 20 per sent shorter.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be
<br>
&gt;&gt; expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are
<br>
&gt;&gt; possible.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have
<br>
&gt;&gt; always ben a deterent to akurate speling.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of silent "e"s in the languag
<br>
&gt;&gt; is disgrasful, and they would go.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing
<br>
&gt;&gt; "th" by "z" and "w" by "v".
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords
<br>
&gt;&gt; kontaining "ou", and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer
<br>
&gt;&gt; kombinations of leters.
<br>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Und efter ze fifz yer, ve vil al be speking German like zey vunted
<br>
&gt;&gt; in ze forst place.
<br>

"neither pine nor apple in a pineapple"

Pine = The texture

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
Plurals are also confusing to students of the English language. For example, if the plural of mouse is mice, why isn't the plural of house, hice?
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Goose/geese but not Moose/meese.

Actually after a while one's ear learns to mangle the plurals on the correct way, most of the time.
