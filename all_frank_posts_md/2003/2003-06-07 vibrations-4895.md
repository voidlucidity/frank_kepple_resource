I can`t figure it up what this vibrations feel like - when i read Monroe`s book it was a little too diificult for me to try to AP because I always got to the part where I`m suppoused to feel the vibrations but I couldn`t feel anything and my experience stopped
<br>
<br>
Now I read Robert Bruce`s book and I was wondering: The vibrations feel like your heart is beating at a very high rate ? - There is an exercise in the book when you should "imagine" the vibrations - How can I imagine them if I don`t know how the vibrations feel like

hmm... not like heartbeats to me... more like waves with no certain pattern to it. i have not much experieces of actual obe´s but i will try to explain the shaking even though. to me it´s a bit like loosing form and become under the influence of drastic waves. often they become very brutal and it feels physical but not dangerous though. maby because of the knowledge of what it is. i also find problems visualise these waves. its more like catching something that feels like motion in the body and see where it leads to me. often when i have managed i have lost control a while before and sort of woken up in the waves.
<br>
<br>
i think "rope"-technique is a good alternative. very good. it combines focus and relaxion, the rule is, keep climbing an imagined rope WHATEVER HAPPENS! and then you just ding dong dang dangelidang doodi! youre out. this robert bruce is really fantastic to me.

Imagine yourself sitting on an unbalanced spin-dryer rotating at high speed. That's what it can feel like, worst case. Or the other end of the scale is where you feel a light buzzing sensation throughout your body. Both situations are normally accompanied by a feeling of movement.

hello tao!
<br>
<br>
this is well described by mr bruce. theres no reason to look for anything or see anything. its just you, climbing a rope from your own point of view. the idea is to remember what it is like to climb a rope. what does the rope feel like, what type of movements are you doing, detailes helps me, you dont have to actually feel it, just pretend. dont try to build up pictures of things, just climb. how it feels to lift yourself up is important, the striving upwards is important, thats what makes the whole thing. once you get some of the climbingmemories, just keep it going, keep on, keep on, sometimes it just works on its own. dont let unimportant thaughts and doubts stay in your mind, just let them go.
<br>
<br>
good luck / jonas

I tried the rope method too - i got distracted by the "how should one climb a rope" i never climbed a rope so I don`t know how does it feels like.. Then I said "maybe it`s the same thing if i imagine climbing a ladder" - but still nothing ! I climb and climb and it gets really boring after 1 hour or maybe even more - and get this frustration - what am i doing wrong ?! i`m a beginner - maybe I should use a more easy to use method - a method with focus instead of concentration - because I can`t viusalise - i get distracted - i feel aware but i can`t concentrate.
<br>
I never felt the vibrations, i never felt anything out of the order - I tried different methodes of waking up in dreams - none worked

Have you ever had a lucid dream? If you did, then you can use that to initiate the vibrations. I am a beginner also, but once I had a lucid dream, and the instant you become lucid, you tell yourself that you want to be out of body. Immediately, you will start feeling vibrations and your lucid dream scene will disappear and you will find yourself awake in your room.
<br>
<br>
The vibrations will become more and more intense, and the first time, I was almost freaked out about the intensity (just like you, I've never felt such an thing before, especially not that powerful). But no fear, just remain still and let the vibrations flow. You will hear a sound like a bang, or maybe feel pressure in your ears and the sounds associated with that. It's like when you are flying in an airplane and the pressure in your ear escapes. That's what I've been experiencing. That sound will announce your total seperation, and the vibrations will disappear. You are now ready to go. Just think to yourself "I want to touch the ceiling" or "I want to fly towards the ceiling" and you will do it.
<br>
<br>
Make sure you don't think about your body, because that will force you back into it. This is a common mistake made by starters (believe me I know). But if you are ready to return, that's all you have to do.
<br>
<br>
You may experience unusual vision. My first time I had 360 degree vision, which was extremely unusual but cool. If you can't see clearly try telling yourself "clarity now" or "control now" if you can't control where you are going. Those two things haven't yet worked for me, but they may be helpful to you.
<br>
<br>
Keep us updated!
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>

hello tao,
<br>
<br>
i am not sure if the vibrations are needed to have an obe or not. all i do know is that when you do get them there will be no mistaking it. from what i have been reading from our friends on here, most beginners have intense vibrations. mine personally feel like i am being electrocuted. THEY ARE INTENSE. for the first 10 - 20 times i really thought i was dying. but after this happening many times and i was still alive i just started to ignore them as some weird dream. but after i stumbled upon books about astral traveling and reading about these sensations with so many other people and sources, i started to delve into the world of astral projection. and thus here i am today. so good luck and happy projecting.

Feeling the heart rate beating is probably the heart centre becoming active. I remember only having it once. As for inducing vibration (if I'm not mistaken) there is an exercise in Robert Peterson online books which is available for free on
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.robertpeterson.org/obebook.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.robertpeterson.org/obebook.html
</a>
Great read, by the way.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I've found out that it is not necessary to feel the vibration to OBE. I do get them sometime. It's always nice gentle buzzing vibration. Although right now I happen to remember some of my dream involving violent vibration like theme such as seeing image of train and hearing the scream quite often in my childhood. Probably they smooth out.
<br>
<br>
The easiest way to obe for me and the one I used most is try to catch myself going to sleep.

I'am a beginner also and i have try the "one-shot" rope tecnique too, without success, apart from the the usual "out of body awareness" sensation near the stomach (that is sign, at least, that the climbing motion is right). I don't know if it really work, but i think that it requires a very strong concentration that it is almost impossible to reach without training. That's because a lot of things may happen while climbing: you can be distracted by random eye-mind images (my problem), your body can move, you can simply lose your focus enough to lose every result, maybe because you can't be able to avoid "keeping an eye" with your mind at what is happening to your body. I suggest you to train from the basics, if you really want to AP, even if it may be hard[xx(]!!!

Your observations, LM, spell out many of the typical issues beginners face. It's one thing talking about it and/or reading about it... but it is quite another actually *doing* it.

Well now I know what the vibrations are, but if you don`t feel them how should i know when im in Astral(i mean you have a OOBE - i don`t know what RTZ,ASTRAL,COSMIC and all that stuff is)..
<br>
And second - how can you not get distracted ?!
