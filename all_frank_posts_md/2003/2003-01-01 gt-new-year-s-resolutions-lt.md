Although this is a bit embarassing, I am going to share with you my New Year's resolutions...I thought that if I shared them and then periodically announce how things are going that it might help me attain these goals:
<br>
<br>
1.  Lose 25 pounds.
<br>
2.  Be more patient and kind to everyone around me (don't get me wrong, I always try to do this....but I want to try to completely control my temper, even when I am driving!)
<br>
3.  Stop biting my nails (a horrible habit I've had since childhood)
<br>
4.  Stop procrastinating (especially my studies)
<br>
5.  Talk less, listen more.
<br>
---------------------------------------------
<br>
What are you resolutions??

Well, Tom asked me this on another thread so I'll answer here:
<br>
<br>
Be more patient with those who guide me. Particularly my regular guide Harath who I argue with more than twice a week, on average.

That's it.

Yours,

New Years resolutions:
<br>
<br>
1) To stop harboring negative feelings and to start being more positive and optimistic in general.
<br>
<br>
2) To stand my ground no matter what for everything I believe, but also to be patient enough to consider others' advice (except for my mom, of course, because she's always right.

)
<br>
<br>
3) To find time every day to practice Pan Gu and Kung Fu.
<br>
<br>
4) To stop dilly-dallying and be myself no matter what, and to stop over-analyzing things.
<br>
<br>
5) To work harder to achieve my goals and to raise my GPA to a 3.5.
