Hello! I'm a 22 year old guy who didn't realize how many people there are that share the same interests as I do about this metaphysical stuff. Very encouraging! I have been experiencing the pre-OBE vibrational state for as long as I can remember but never knew what it was until I was 17. Now I've learned to self-induce them using a broken sleep cycle method and tactile stimulation to induce and strengthen the vibrations.
<br>
<br>
I'm also an occasional lucid dreamer. My favorite thing to do in an LD is fly.
<br>
<br>
Wow, this looks like a very well-put-together forum. Very extensive and organized too. I hope to meet all of you, make some friends and learn a lot.[8D]

Dear GTP,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum.  I love lucid dreaming.  It is so wonderfully creative.
<br>
<br>
I am writing this while gingerbread men bake in the oven.  Mmmmm!  Sorry I guess it is kind of cruel to mention that wonderful smell but could not help myself.[

Hey there,
<br>
<br>
Welcome aboard.
<br>
<br>
When I saw GTP I was thinking about Mitsubishi Lancer GTO or 3000GT. GTO as screen name sounds mighty cool... [
