This thread is the only proof you need that I am truly, truly evil.
<br>
<br>
The question is posed in a magical context. Are men more skilled at magic, or are women?  Who's got the most power?  Or is there true balance in this magical kingdom, with no one gender possessing more "juice" than the other?  If the magic is different between the genders, how is it different?

<section>
The person who's put in the time,effort,and energy tobuild theskills is most "powerful".
<br>
Men and women think differently, hence they access energy differently.
<br>
Don't ask me how it's different, 'cause I haven't done both this timearound.

My personal opinion:
<br>
<br>
Women have more power and less inhibitions.
<br>
Men have more (self-)"control" on the little power they have.
<br>

Women are more likely to start using it,i dont know why.

But when men finally get the thumbs out of the arse they have more power.

I think women can be more focussed building up more energy for their spells and stuff.
<br>
Men can be more focussed on the thing they use magic on, so they can use less energy for the same results.
<br>
<br>
So in general: men are the better attackers and women are the better defenders.

If you use magic to fight you need to find a better use for your time.

I don't think that there is any difference between the sexes when it comes to magic but it does depend on how much they believe in it.

Concerning the occult... I have seen/met many women who had gifts, mediums, sometimes throwing spells, reading the future in a cup of coffee, etc... I haven't seen many men capable of that, however I have heard of men who knew more than what they showed... they knew about the death of other poeple before it happens, or about their own death...

Interesting thoughts, and born out by historical records.
<br>
However, traditionally the most powerful woman magically speaking is the Crone, the woman who has matured beyond the age of fertility.

I really do not see a difference between the sexes. And I think powerful is a relitive term.
<br>
<br>
Feminine energy is usually associated with mystical, spiritual, psychic energies while masculine is more grounded. Since we all have both energies within us, it is only a matter of accessing them, then the physical sex is not important.

I am not so sure that the semen has to contain the energy. I think that the man can retain the energy and still expel the semen. But retaining the semen can be beneficial and probably necessary to one that cannot retain the energy otherwise.

Namaste,
<br>
ahhh the crone!  hmmm...i didnt mean to state the womens sexuality is her
<i>
 only
</i>
power.  its not the sex itself, but it is, for me, the process in which a woman relates to and manifests sexual energies and play.  initiation is a good example to illustrate my opinion.  in australian aboriginal culture, men have elaborate and very often held "secret" magic ritual and ceremony.  words of power, gesture, and a complex mental framework in which to percieve life.  the women have their secret ritual as well, but not as often and not nearly as elaborate.  what does this mean?  for me, it is an indication of the natural process of a womans growth through life.  she bleeds.  if only men could understand, even intuitively the intensity of the, dare i say, enforced, psycho-physiological genetically catalysed initiatory processes.  men us tools and stories, and have developed great skill and art in these realms, in order to produce the processes which naturally happen within a woman.  please, please, men, dont think that i believe all woman
<b>
 are
</b>
initiates...the diagram doesnt work like that.  but
<i>
 by default
</i>
we, as men, have to work in different ways.  back to the crone...she is, for me, an archetype representing the energies necessary for a woman to integrate as she grows.  it is not healthy, imho, to
<i>
 become
</i>
an archetype, as humans were meant to be human, and not demi-gods.  but it is an imperative to integrate those archetypal energies that live within and manifest through us, because we are all and all of the Great Spirit of all things.  for me, the crone is most powerful, in that, it is that aspect of the archetypal feminine which is death, time and the eater of all things.  vagina dentata, so to speak.  have you seen older women who are this??  they are not entirely pleasant to be around and the power they wield consumes them as well...but have you also seen(or are you being?)a woman who has done to integrate the crone??  they seem to be those ladies who are older (post-menapausal even) women who are desired(sexually and otherwise) much more than young nubile women/girls.
<br>
fallenangel- i have found for myself; yes, to an extent, that the energy contained within the semen can be "extracted".  but, in my experience, it is a paltry sum to that seed of life itself.  my perspective-mind, body and spirit are One.

<section>
It was my intent to be vague; all I ask is that everyone's answers be put in a magical context.
<br>
<br>
So far, so good . . . but what about the ability to purposely manifest? to focus? to create? to DO MAGIC?  I'm talking REAL SORCERY, not armchair mysticism, and certainly not the inherent power of female sexuality (which is more a function of men's reluctance to control his urges, than of female "power" over men - - - I mean this in the historic sense, so you male individuals out there, no offense is intended!).
<br>
<br>
My opinion is based upon 20 years of observation.  In general, when it comes to sorcery and power, men are more variable than women.
<br>
<br>
The male practitioners I have met have ranged from the unimpressive to the mindblowing.  Most were pretty pathetic, having come to the occult to find power after years of being picked on by other little boys.  They read a lot of books, wore a lot of black and silver, and copped an attitude, and that's about it. Most of these men were nothing more than poseurs; they could not even be described as sorcerers or magicians.
<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.  The two most powerful sorcerers I've ever met were MEN!
<br>
WHY?  Many of the female practitioners I've spoken to wonder the same thing, i.e., why, when most witches are female, and most men in the magical community have so little power (relatively speaking), are the MOST powerful sorcerers men?  (Also, WHY, when the world's women do most of the cooking, are the best chefs in the world men? We wonder about that too!).
<br>
<br>
Women seem to hug the (mediocre?) center of the power bell curve.  In general, the female sorcerers I have met are more powerful and capable than nearly all of the male practitioners around them. However, to this day I have yet to meet a female sorcerer who comes even close the two men I mentioned previously.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps a good analogy is intelligence.  Most of the insanely-high IQs belong to men (Einstein, etc. - although many women can be classified as "genius" with an IQ over 130, there are not too many female "Einsteins").  However, there are also more retarded boys than retarded girls, and 85% of the autistics in the world are male. Men embody both extremes, while women hang out closer to the center of the intelligence curve.
<br>
<br>
At least, this is what I have seen over my 20 years observing this kind of thing.  High variability in men, low variability in women.

The most skilled person I know is female.
<br>
<br>
She can astral project on a whim if she needs to, has punched through walls (through 2x4's) without feeling a thing, can heal herself of sickness rapidly, in one case going from nearly bed-ridden to very, very few symptoms in less than 12 hours... In one case, I was at least 50-feet away through a wall or two, and she set up an energy "marker"(thats what she called it, anyway[|)]) and nearly knocked me off my feet.... I was very dizzy, lights dancing in front of my eyes, and barely stood up. There may be more skilled persons of course, but I don't know of any yet.
<br>
<br>
In spite of this, I'm keeping a neutral position[^] after all, I taught her a lot of what she knows about how to manipulate energy... Not that I can do well most of what I taught her... Student beat the teacher.[

<section>
Tisha,
<br>
<br>
by the way, do you know that tisha'/tissa' means 9 in semitic languages (hebrew / arabic,..) ?
<br>
<br>
Your question, or more precisely, the precisions you gave us in your second posting, point to an evidence that is true thru history and all over the planet (unfortunately) that man is rulling the world by sheer force and that the woman has not yet be given the place she deserves, which is either next or higher than the place of man.
<br>
<br>
You could as well ask "why most of the managers are men?", why most of the cashiers are women? why there are still women not working and staying at home to take care of the children? SOme 50 years ago women did not have the right to vote in France, .. the world is still in the process of evolving, and only recently the issue of the place of the women has started to be considered, and only in a few societies... Most of the religions have been written by men for men, most of the rules of this world are so, and even in the US there are still so many things to say about it ..... Let's not even speak of the most common sexual abuse that the "boss" is "inflicting" to his female workers, ... but even when a women want to progress in her life, in her work place, in her study , in the academic, or wherever it is, IT IS THE SAME, there are men stading there in front not letting her pass... whether it is by lying, trishery, abusing, force... etc... How come most of the senator are men? Most of the governors are men? all the presidents of the uS have been men?
<br>
<br>
It has to do with the almost "archaic" form of the society, which has been that FORCE (mere physical force) is the one that decides for many things, whether in the family or at work or at school or in the university, etc....
<br>
<br>
So your question is back to the basic and as such the answer has to be digged out from there and the answer is obvious, that no matter if the woman is performing better than the man, the man is ruling the world... It will take a long time to change, we are still far from the ideal perfection... And that starts at the very begining, in the houses of people, with things such as why if both men and women work 40 h a week and make the same money, why the hell is it to the women to cook dinner? to take care of the children? etc... Even if there are exceptions to that, I believe that everything start there.

"The soul; that's control."
<br>
<br>
Pushed to our limits there are no difference between man and women and we discover that the only limits exist in our minds.
<br>
<br>
The human with the highest IQ in our physical world (I have to say it that way.) is female.
<br>
<br>
Speaking from experience, I know that I can be very centered on my goal, almost to an obsessive degree. When I start a 'project' I devote absurd amounts of time, attention and energy to it, neglecting all else. I can not go on like this for too long as other things eventually become urgent enough for me to force a break in my concentration. Right now my 'project' is reaching the heights in the mystic world, but that's more like a life-long commitment than an actual project (Like coding an AI designed to kill other AIs. Boy did I spend time on that a few years ago...).
<br>
In regard of what Tisha mentioned, I suspect that I have a milder form of autism that basically increases concentration, and I have been told that I'm 'intelligent', but rather than beat my chest about it I'd like to let actions speak for me. So far I have next to none to show for it. I'd be a fool to claim otherwise. "Armchair mystican" suits me right in that regard. [:I]
<br>
<br>
Where was I going with this again...?
<br>
Oh yeah; concentration. Concentration is vital to focusing one's will on a goal. The greater the focus, the greater the effect. Still, concentration is not everything. Without control, concentration is wasted. One needs to learn to control one's desires, and in that regard females excel. Men on the other hand excel at concentration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
...But don't take my word for it. =P

<section>
Ha ha . . . yes, I have heard some (male) magicians explain it this way:  "Men are better magicians because men can focus better than women, men are just more capable."  Which is a joke.  Men have the luxury to focus because the women are running around for them, taking care of the minutae of mundane living!
<br>
<br>
Women are Mistresses of Multitasking. We're scrubbing the toilets, changing the diapers, buying the food, hauling the water, wiping the childrens noses and asking our men "may I bring you a beer?" althewhile fussing over our faces and bodies to keep mens' attention!
<br>
<br>
And those women who have jobs, it is usually in those career fields where they are paid to do more of the same (i.e., cooking, cleaning, nursing, attending to children and  men).  There are a few exceptions (ie., the female firefighter, independent writer, or CEO), but not enough to disprove my point.
<br>
<br>
To live a woman's life, things move much more smoothly when one DOESN'T focus.  There is too much to attend to! Where does a woman find the time to get really GOOD at something?  The answer, unfortunately, is to say "no."  Close down the store!
<br>
<br>
But the consequences of such a radical act can seem dire to a woman who has her self-worth wrapped up in meeting other people's needs.

<section>
I apologize if I expressed myself bluntly. It was not my intention to say that men a better; just different.
<br>
Still, with practice differences can be overcome. I for one am learning to control myself, and recently I have learned such fantastic things as humility. I value it greatly. I have learned that if I don't 'feel like doing something' I can convince myself that I am in control and do it anyway. I'm not letting my laziness control me.
<br>
I've got a lot of work on that laziness part. Trying to make it a habit that will change my character. [|)]
<br>
<br>
If I have understood it correctly, this is what woman have. - The ability to control themselves. Something which most men lack. Our desires take us by the nose and lead most of us through life; a journey that we have to do the work for completing anyway. I for one am learning to take control of the reins, and hepfully I'll be able to go where I
<i>
 will
</i>
to go rather than where desire leads me.
<br>
<br>
And hupefully I'll make a good husband one day. [

<section>
don't know if anyone else has mentioned any of this yet (sorry for not reading the other posts, i'm a bit strapped for time), but there has been a study done recently which showed that men's brains were more specialized in their learning while women's are more generalized.
<br>
<br>
in other words, men tend to learn just a few skills VERY f'ing good, while women learn a whole f'ing lot of skills but at less extreme levels. whether that carries over to raw power or not, i'd tend to guess yes by just looking at the average male compared to the average female in physical strength (and it can easily be argued that whether one power or another, power is power). so likely males would win more often than females when it comes to shows of raw power (note the bell curve though).
<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, it is also well known that females are much more in tune with their emotions, and usually their energy as well. couple that with the potential for a wider variety of magical skills than males, and it strongly suggests that female magic users would more often beat male magic users in skillful competition (but once again, note the bell curve).
<br>
<br>
perhaps there is a balance overall, but when you start going down into the specific areas of magical application, some types of people just ARE better than others.
<br>
<br>
that's my opinion [|)].

I love being right. [8D]
<br>
<br>
The article does, however, show that the difference is purely statistical and not really written in stone. If, like you said, some of the most powerful are men, does this mean that they are better at controlling their emotions than the statistical woman? While the answer could possibly be 'yes' I'd rather say that there are other factors involved in this equation.
<br>
<br>
Tisha, you seem to have a lot more experience in this field than I do, so could you tell me, what about women and concentration? Certainly there are those that are very good at it, but what about the control aspect then?

Ceriel, I cannot speak on woman's behalf on this.  I can only speak for myself, and it seems I have an unusual ability to focus. However, during different times of the month (hormones!), and when I was pregnant and nursing, well, forget it! [xx(]
<br>
<br>
A funny story:  Sometimes, on the Astral, I focus so much that the object of my attention actually catches fire!  I don't quite know what that all means (and when I lose awareness of the fact that I'm on the Astral, I think it's really happening).[:O]
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my focus is laser-sharp most of the time, and as a result, I tend to be a high-achieving person (with whatever I set my mind to). [^]
<br>
<br>
However, when I allow my focus to deteriorate, it degenerates into a contrary stubbornness.  Which is a sort of focused lack-of-focus, if that makes sense. [xx(]
<br>
<br>
As for control?  Actually, I think the ability to instinctively control ones Self has a lot to do with that magical cocktail we call "hormones."  Men and women have the same hormones, only in different concentrations.  Womens hormones can fluctuate wildly, especially with PMS and menopause, so their degree of (instinctive) control sometimes can approach that of men [
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
].  I find it amusing how men can be so upset when the women they love start acting like . . . well, MEN! (my ex-husband used to schedule his business trips around my menstrual cycle [
<img alt=":o" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
)]).
<br>
<br>
But CONSCIOUS CONTROL comes from Will, and from focus!  If you have the proper focus, and it is your Will to control yourself, you Will! [

Will is motion, energy. Motion seems to be controllable by consciousness. One must be aware (conscious) of something to control it, and that is spiritual development. A circle that is actually a spiral. =)

<br>
<br>
Women's Revolt is something I find rather intreguing. Most men that I know have nothing against women in power and no one works against it. Yet women seem to fight extremely hard with... something. Most men think  in the situation "If you want the power, take it." yet few women do. I don't know why this is. What I do know that is that liberties are taken, not given. If anyone, woman or man, expects power to simply be handed over she or he is sadly mistaken. You can shout as much as you want, organize protests and whatnot, but it is _individuals_ who _take_ power. An aggressive act of independence that is for each and everyone to do by themsleves.
<br>
<br>
No, telling other women to break free is not the way to accomplish what you want. Each and every woman has to light that fire that burns in the heart, causing blood to boil in the heat of battle and realize that their restrictions only exists in their own minds. That their battles they must fight for themselves and that no one will come to the rescue, because if someone does, independence is lost and the battle with it.
<br>
The harder the casue is to accomplish the more it is worth. Gifts are worthless, only serving to tie you down.
<br>
Womems enemy exists not in men, but in the mind of each and every.

I think the coming generation is less sexist than the previous one...  Give it a few years.  Right now, I can tell you that I still see quite a few examples of sex "descrimination".  It also depends on the geographic location; country; religions; traditions...  Even in France, for equal work, women still tend to earn less.  Another "problem" is... when you get kids and have to raise them.  Again, these days, husbands start slowly to take vacations to take care of the kids/house while the wife is going to work...

Where I work, we have many female managers and many working along side the males. And I see more and more females taking those jobs. At one time I think your point was valid, and in some places it may well still be, but from what I have seen it really no longer is. Women are no longer held back just because they are women.

As I remember it (from what I read), the polarities switch for each sucessive dimension you go up. So for instance, female is negative and male positive upon the physical dimension. On the astral though (emotional base I think), the female is positive and male megaive. Then on the mental dimension male is posiive and female negative......etc etc. So the question of which is the more powerful hasn't really got an answer as it depends on which level the working is being carried out upon.
<br>
However, the bell curves show that women have a higher average intelligence than men, but men have more genuis's (genuii?) than women. Not sure how that fits into the above!
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, it also seems to me a possibility that the fundamental laws also reverse as you go up the dimensional scale. On the physical, like repels like and opposites attract (eg magnets), but the laws of the astral energies as I understand state that likes attract and opposites repel. Interesting stuff.

'Knowledge' is just subjective experience while understanding is objective.

Knowing gives birth to desire (and will tends to be to saturate desire), and thus we become slaves to the desire. Understanding frees us from desire.

KNOWING IF IT IS KNOWING, comes from the developed skill,

not accumulation of facts.
<br>
Understanding is superior to knowledge, because knowledge evolves.
<br>
so, up to this point we agree, completley!
<br>
but KNOWING if it is complete, does not need desire to fall into.
<br>
only uncomplete KNOWING leads to an desire, and uncomplete KNOWING is named KNOWLEDGE.
<br>
and knowledge longs for accumulation which is desire!
<br>
purpose of understanding is 'TO KNOW'.

Women tend to be highly emmotional, more so than men.  Also, more intuitive due to our nurturing instincts.  Men somehow trade that in for more physical strength.  Women also have major fluctuations in energy levels throughout the month and are more connected to the moon and tides.  Does this make us better?? Who knows... interesting topic though.

But who says we are limited by such things as rocks floating in space? If we base power on such a thing, what would we do if they disappeared?
<br>
Unlikely, you might say, but is dependence power? If we depend on other things, then that makes us weak, doesn't it?
<br>
<br>
So what then is true power, if not the ability recognize sources of energy and apply them in a manner suitable to your will? And if that is the case, then surely both men and women can utilize the same sources.
<br>
<br>
Personally I don't really like systems of magic dependent on events limited in time. I get the sense that the environment is controlling the magician when I would prefer it being the other way around. Sure one could argue that one is to live in harmony with nature, but in this regard, isn't that counter-productive?

IF YOU SEEK POWER in cosmos, you Will have none, you could only fall into the "pit called because"=ego.(relativity : soul against ego.)

If you do not seek it in the cosmos, you will have it, BUT ONLY IF YOU DO NOT WANT IT!!

that is neurosis, that is cosmos, that is relativity.

And who provides you with an do-not-want power?

cosmic equilibrium.-that is neurosis.

<br>
when you want it, you cannot have it!
<br>
when you don't want it-you will get it!
<br>
that is neurosis, THAT IS DESIRE! REVERSE FROM EXSISTANCE=reversed ego=soul.
<br>
SO IF "YOU DO NOT DESIRE IT, YOU WILL GET IT."
<br>
<br>
but in the Existance sense-there is no "NOT"
<br>
like "DESIRE IT NOT"-THAT IS A DESIRE!
<br>
that "not" against "IT IS" 'HERE AND NOW!'
<br>
I WILL DO IT!
<br>
instead :"I have it because I do NOT want it"
<br>
that is neurosis.
<br>
<br>
What is "not" in Existance sense?   - NOTHING!
<br>
there is no 'not' mathematicaly - - = +
<br>
there is + + = +
<br>
<br>
And to Exist and seek power:
<br>
"if you have a stick, I will give it to you,
<br>
if you do not have a stick, I will take it away from you."
<br>
<br>
that is only thing which is NOT an DESIRE,
<br>
speaking from the relativity.
<br>
<br>

A silly question in my opinions.
<br>
We are all extant reflections of the same singular existence.
<br>
Thus each are inherently equal and equally capable subject only to the lessons we have selected for the given lifetime.
<br>
<br>
If one understands magick as the appplication of one's Will to effect some desired, or more often, a needed change in the physical reality there is no difference in effectiveness attributable to physical sex.
<br>
<br>
To think, in spiritual term, of differences between the physical sexes, is to succumb to the illusion of us being in some respect different and separate from one another.
<br>
<br>
Think in terms of who it is that does.

Doesnt one of Carlos Castanedas books (cant remember which one now) talk about how mens energy needs to be directed while womens energy needs to be contained?
<br>
<br>
And also that female sorcerors are more powerful because their periods (PMS) create a crack between the worlds infront of them? An ability males dont have?!
<br>
<br>
If anyone knows what book I am talking about, it would be great to remember.

Also, I dont know if any of you have heard of the scientific proof that says the female brain wave activity asleep is equal to the same as the males brain wave activity while they are AWAKE! If anyone can find me this also, I would love to remember it again.
<br>
<br>
Basically, they measured the brain wave activity and realised that with females they used more parts of their brain equally, whereas the men used less parts but had a larger concentration of energy in that part.
<br>
<br>
From this, one could suggest that if females could concentrate as much energy as the males do in one part into all the parts of the brain... they would be much more powerful.
<br>
<br>
The different magical arts in both males and females demonstrate to me the different brain activity that is required for different magical paths. How ones brain is accustomed to working determines greatly which path they follow and what kind of skills and abilities they actually possess.
<br>
<br>
As for the use of ethnogenic plants and the like... do they not affect ones brain wave activity?
<br>
<br>
Think about it!
<br>
<br>
How many times have you women spoken to a male watching sport on tv or using a computer without him even realising you even said anything?

There a few types of people in these forums.
<br>
<br>
1) People that are here for a serious discussion and talk about things that are related
<br>
<br>
2) People that are here to have a little fun while learning something new and know when NOT to joke
<br>
<br>
and
<br>
<br>
3) Bloody MORONS such as yourself Azaithoth999 the red that A) talk crap B) are not worth time and space and C) confirm to everyone they are type 3)
<br>
<br>
As for those that are type 1) and 2) I am happy to share, discuss and learn things with.
<br>
<br>
Azaithoth999 the red, you not only lack respect for other peoples sexual preferences and gender, you have an ego and need to grow up. Dont think I havent dealt with your type before!

Thanks for the info Nagual.
<br>
<br>
Im not quiet sure why Carlos Castaneda or Don Juan or even the Shamans of Ancient Mexico would believe that PMS is more of a magical aid than it is a burden. Maybe it increases power intensity within the female? I think the book I am talking about was saying something about PMS being able to shift the assembleage point. Its been a while since I have read those teachings, I am a bit rusty. Maybe someone can bring me up to scratch?!
<br>

I agree with Jilola to a certain extent.  I remember reading somewhere that kundalini is different for different sexes, different sexual energy.  But then again, that is just something I read, truth is I don't know, and I doubt anyone here actually 'knows', but it is interesting to discuss.

I am definitely more powerful when I have PMS.  It also makes me more dangerous.
<br>
<br>
My dreams and flash-visions are more frequent intense the week before my period.  I also have more out-of-body experiences.  I feel things more keenly, and pick up on people's emotions and their intent much more easily.  My Force is laser-sharp and my magic slams hard!
<br>
<br>
Fortunately for humanity, I am not a cruel person by nature, and my ego is usually in check.  My magic focuses on clarity of vision for all . . . it's just that when I have PMS I do not concern myself with whether or not people find this clarity upsetting or offensive.  Also, when I see injustice, sexism, stupidity, or cruelty when I have PMS, I am much less willing to tolerate it, and much more willing to take fierce and corrective action, using magical or practical means, regardless of the consequences.

Intersting Tisha -dont worry, you are not type 3 and im not saying that because I am afriad you might be PMSing
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I have noticed this kinda 'ability' in many of my female friends. Sometimes so strong that I could easily notice that they had PMS. And then when I tell them you need to relax "you are having your periods!" (not a good idea) they get angry at me for days, and then when they settle down and apologise asking me how I knew I tell them I could just sense it. I guess they just feel 'invaded' because its true- I do actually sense it sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Other times, when I am spending time with a female having PMS... I tend to feel 'altered' slightly, and I see strange things happening around me. Whether it is my perception being altered or my female friend changing things around me, I do not know. All I know that sometimes when a woman knows how to enter through the 'crack' of the worlds (or however Castanada puts it) it is enough to influence others (even put me in that world also). Some females understand that their menstrual cycle is more than just a phase or a burden without being knowledgable in magic- that alone is enough to create magic things (ones that magical ppl can see).
<br>
<br>
I believe those magical females that see it as a gift and really know how to utilise it, can far out power men.
<br>
<br>
This power measurement is ofcourse with the ratio of 1 female to 1 male and based on what I have seen.

How does being more represented and more prominent equal more power? Power in number? But that does not mean that the individual is more powerful. Being seen and known does not make one powerful, atleast magic wise.

He throws the flaming sword at you, and you have to do something.  But what?  Run to mom? Not exacly a power-response!

this is perhaps a dumb thing to say, but does it really matter who is more powerful?  why must we always focus on who's better/smarter/etc?  we can make all kinds of generalizations about male and female characteristics that may or may not be beneficial to their power, but from both sides there is always someone who is an exception to the rule.  there are guys who have more "feminine" personality traits than "masculine", and there are women who have more "masculine" than "feminine".  sure, they aren't commonplace, but they do exist.  i would think that would have an effect on things.  and then what about people of mixed/indeterminate/whatever you wanna call it gender, like hermaphrodites and such?  sometimes thinking too much in male/female, black/white is too limiting.  there are too many places where the lines get blurred.  we are all most powerful when combining our talents.  [

<section>
There are human hermaphrodites.  Usually, when a child is born this way, the parents decide what sex they want their child to be, and a sex change (? sex-reduction ?) operation is performed right away.  Sometimes the parents make the wrong choice, and then their "little girl" grows up wanting to be a boy!  Hermaphrodites, understandably, often end up in therapy.
<br>
<br>
In the native american tribes, hermaphrodites were believed to be most powerful, and they were trained to be medicine-men/women.  Even non-hermaphrodite medicine men/women adopted the dress and mannerisms of the opposite sex to merge the male-female aspects and increase their power.

Not to drift too far from the topic, I just had a thought: Now when the sun, AFAIK a masculine symbol, is highly active, and this night's (Night here.) lunar eclipse coincidence, it surely allows for some symbolical interpritation. During lunar eclipses the moon becomes red, so could one interprit this as an enforcement of the feminine aspect?
<br>
And what a wonderful thing to remember the claim of 'strange' things starting to happen now in November, wouldn't you say?
<br>
- Is this the night our most important celestials bodies become one?

Only one thing is for sure for me and that is that I am going to stay up and watch the event. (I like to watch.) [

Hey,
<br>
<br>
I'm basically female, but I have male pattern body hair and a way different concentration of hormones and feel sort of stuck between the genders at times. Where does that place me?
<br>
Also, if spirit is genderless, and you are working in a spiritual realm and not focusing on the physical, then logically it may follow that there it may be clear and neuter also.

This thread is evil, Tisha. It really is.
<br>
<br>
But since you posted it, I just have to reply. You're right about that women generally are more powerful. Actually they are more powerful in life too. Cause they have a sort of determination that men lack. However, women usually share everything they know, they instantly want to speak of everything with anybody. Men are more secretive. You could say they think more than women do. At least those who are "the best". Sure there are men who act like they are powerful, but actually are excrement. But have you heard the saying:
<br>
"Act like you're stupid, but be smart".
<br>
The most powerful are men, because they just are. And some of these "excrement" can be powerful as well.
<br>
YOu might never know where the smartest is hiding...

mmmm interesting, is it that historicaly men would take up arms so quickly and natrualy, witch (nother pun [8D]) left the ladys at home to spin somthing more sinister, thus looking back we find more female spell casters?
<br>
<br>
It seems more women are proficient mediums etc, I believe thats because many woman are more attuned to thier own love emotions and are able to open thier hearts more easily as a rule. AS for magic dunno, I think more girls are intersted in it to be honest.
<br>

Sounds right to me, wouldnt that be some one who could find balance in thier male female polarity. Physical sex has nothing to do with our soul or spirit. Just the sex we chose for this incarnations life lessons.
<br>
Native american Indians believed bisexual males or females very sacred, and reserved certain tradional ceramonies especialy to be performed by them. Believing them to have two souls in one body, making them more balanced in love, logic, and strength.

I gotta stir it....
<br>
<br>
My opinion is that each sex has their 'general' strengths in how the brain is used.  Women can access both sides of the brain, or go back and forth crossing sides easier than a male.  Women are more right-brained in their viewpoints/actions/learning.  Men are more left-brained.  So there we are.  Here is where all the trouble comes in.
<br>
<br>
Men say that women are more fickle-minded (access back &amp; forth easier); that they are too emotional (more right-brained than..uh...yep, males!).  And then of course you have the monthly hormal fluctuations.  But the other side of the coin... Women say men are too unfeeling (right-brained/logic) and not very artistic/creative (that's why Queer Eye for the Straight Guy show was created, remember?) [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]  This is just some basic stuff for the 'normal' genders.  I am not talking about gays because they are in a separate category and defy boundaries (this is a very gay topic btw).   So after saying this, I would like to add that each sex can dominate in different ways when it comes to psi-power stuff.  Also, that some people (regardless of sex) just are born with tons of it while the rest of us go about it the 'old fashioned way'.
<br>
<br>
Now someone mentioned hermaphrodites and transgendered people.  The "in" word for hermaphrodites now is "intersexed".  Like the Native American Indians, I also feel these people are very special.  And to complicate matters,now we have another category refusing to be either male or female, but a "third gender".  (My view on this is that all of us fit into the spectrum somewhere, either on the ends or somewhere in between, or maybe even in the middle like these folks!)  So, in the end, I believe gender has no meaning unless it means something to you.[}:)]
<br>
<br>
Everyone has their abilities, talents and troubles and maybe, just maybe, it all depends on what we are able to work thru in life and find at the bottom of the laundry basket.  And we all do alot of laundry!
<br>
<br>
But for some reason, no matter how much I research on the subject of sex and power useage...it always seems to come back to personal balance.

<section>
I Think women are generally more powerful then men. However I think that it is quite normal to find men who are more powerful then women. The reason being, men live life totally different from women.
<br>
<br>
Men are goal Orientated
<br>
<br>
This can be compared to the following
<br>
<br>
When a man and a women go out on a date the males goal is to end up in bed with the women.
<br>
<br>
Having men and women use the same road is a recipe for disaster.
<br>
When a male drives his car to the supermarket he tries to do it in record time anybody slower then him is wasting his time 'Road rage'. When a male goes shopping he whizzes around the supermarket in record time. Men are more competitive and fly through life without giving thought to consequences. There are many more examples sex ect. Compare this type of behaviour to the female and we get the opposite.
<br>
<br>
The Female knows weather she is going to end up in bed with the male. She has to give consent for this to occur. Therefore the female is in control. When the female drives to the supermarket she's happy to get there safely, however long it takes. Once she is at the supermarket she is happy to shop for as long as it takes. Women are multi taskers this shows that they can base the attention on different tasks at a time. Men tend to put all there attention into a single task/goal at a time. Football as an example this is why most men love football .
<br>
<br>
I expect the same behaviour with Magick study/practice as long as the goal is truth and not disire
<br>
<br>
The average male will put time and effort to proceed rapidly as long as his attention is focused on a goal.
<br>
<br>
The female is happy to proceed at any given rate sometimes fast sometimes slow. This would explain why there are more professional males and so forth. However this is just my humble male opinion. Once the truth is realised there is no limit to potential of either.

In terms of magick, niether are powerful, but women are still regarded as much lower than men. Seeing as all you're doing is calling on spirits to do your work, you don't really have any actual power. But in all rituals and history of magick, women have always been shown as basically worthless, objects of sexual pleasure.

Well I dont think its an issue of power, but occurance. Men by nature are to be "strong" and basicaly insensitive. While women tend to the children and are more caring. Because of this, men discredit the paranormal to the point where almost all psionic activity ceases.
<br>
<br>
By that nature alone, women are far more likely to become psychic. While men are far rarer. "Mother's intuition" is a great example of this. Women as a whole have a much higher degree of psionics, from the start, however....
<br>
<br>
Although men rarely devolp the "gift". The ones that do, do so strongly enough to create the illusion that men are stronger. Instead you are simply seeing the cream-of-the-crop.
<br>
<br>
Now compared side by side, using this criteria. Things change dramatically. The men are equal to the women, but are simply rarer, and are the "cream-of-the-crop", where as women is a mixed bag.

Take a look at some research and you will find

is mostly individual. For this I guess you would get the

This is a very interesting debate.  I think however that the secret to this question lies in the mysteries of mystical polarity.

As far as I can tell neither is more important or superior to the other.

They both have there place and function in the universal scheme of life. In other words they rely on each other to create harmony in the cosmos.

Male is spiritual substance and female is the over-coming of ego. Without this polarization, physical reality and astral reality does not exist. Since the paradigm, the polarization of energy was occuring with each framentation of oversouls.
<br>
<br>
The male's unlimited production of semen through his life represents the infiniteness of spiritual, whereas the female's limited supply of eggs through her life represents the finitness of physical reality.
<br>
<br>
However, in copulation, such is the opposite to have both balance and unity in God-mind. The female is represented as infinity instead, with her vortex , sucking all her mate gives. The male, her mate, however, can only give that much. The act of copulation, in addition to hopes, increases the chance of those hopes.
<br>
<br>
People or other beings who hate women are not overcoming their ego and The Ego. That is, they are creating their own illusions and not accepting God's reality. Such beings are Satan's entities and the Satan consciousness itself.
<br>
<br>
-- off topic
<br>
Nevertheless, a soul may be attracted to the same sex, just because it is either linearly or adjacently living more lives as the opposite sex. Then again, it could be from mind-control, first-and-truamatic sexual experience from the same sex (a gay rape), or childhood learning.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I admit that the above are only my theories, in addition to presented knowledge from my studies.

To be honest i think that women think that they have more intuition. It´s a kind of myth.
<br>
<br>
For example, me and my friends (male friends) we love to go into the forest and we never get lost (even in new places). We always know where are we going.
<br>
<br>
With our females friends they get lost in no time, their intuition fails.
<br>
<br>
Women are more sensible, people say. Well, if sensible its a person that hears the others and loves to breath every single piece of nature, so i am sensible. Some times i dont see that kind of sensibility in women.
<br>
<br>
Conclusion (no i am not saying that men have more intuition): they are both equal maybe with slight little differences.
<br>
<br>
Of course that you need to know that i am only provocating you because in fact, i dont know nothing about magic, consequently i dont have idea about who can be more powerful in that matter (women vs men)[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
].
<br>
<br>
DreamWeaver: about passion, i think that you are correct but not totally: we dont think with "you know what". When it comes to sex yes, but our passion does not come from our "you know what"[
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]. I think that women sometimes are a little to cold.
<br>
<br>
They are the kind of person that can "ignore" a man as a possible boyfriend just because he does not have a stable financial situation.
<br>
<br>
btw: you said that you use your hearth to much...hmmm...you are a girl with passion...give me your email ![

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I'm surprised there is even a question like this. Women have the edge by a large margin.

Everyone's individual, if one learns how to access all aspects of themself then as was mentioned earlier perhaps the physical gender becomes irrelevant.

Well, I know beans about magic (magic beans.. get it?), but I've always had the impression that "magic" happens when men and women work together, and when large diverse groups of people work together.

Twelve pages are dedicated to this one simple question, quite a controversy.  Because of this, I read each post thoroughly, and have come to the answer that can put this exhaustive thread to rest.
<br>
<br>
On the question of the sex that has the most power, the highest potential for power, the highest of intellect and the greatest of focus and will, the answer is simple.  Men.
<br>
<br>
MEN, MEN, MEN!!!.
<br>
<br>
Thank you. It is my sincere hope this can finally grant finality to this, the age old battle of the sexes.

If one of the sexes can truly be more powerful than the other on more than a temporary basis, then we are in trouble. I think it is the tension between the sexes which allows both to develop.

Magic is about making a choice to have power and to use it. Just having the interest to do this goes a long way toward reaching that goal. It is not about sex or sexuality; it is just that sex happens to be a very popular topic to discuss.

On to page 14 as everyone that hasn't had a chance to stand on the soapbox to share their opinion on this topic stands up, and some of our more long winded members make their 4th and 5th rounds.  LOL, I love the internet.

The Feminine Unmanifest is more deadlier then the Masculine Unmanifest due to the mismanagement of the Unmanifest on behalf of both sexes.

I'm not even going to read this post, what a basic (Reboot insult) idea... each sex has it's own strengths and weaknesses, and even then it's just a generality far eclipsed by our individuality.

Before I say anything else I'm going to first state that I'm firmly in the different but equal camp. Souls are genderless by nature, and need to incarnate as both as part of progress. But, there wouldn't need to be incarnations as both if there weren't inherent differences between the 2, at the very least as regards biology and social issues.
<br>
<br>
I came across something in "New Chakra Healing" (I love that book) about different emphasis on the chakras between genders. Women
<i>
 tend
</i>
to have more strongly developed 2nd and 4th chakras, while men tend more towards the 1st and 3rd. This is in part due to biological necessity. (women requiring more energy in that area for childbirth,) but the way the energy runs accounts for the more obvious differences. I suspect that this may run all the way up the internal energy system, with men tending towards the odd numbered chakras and women towards the even. This would cover quite well why women tend to be more emotional (2nd and 4th chakras) and intuitive (6th chakra) and men tend to be more passionate (1st) willful (3rd) and communicate more directly(5th)
<br>
<br>
I have no idea whether this would extend to the higher chakras, however the large number of gurus who are male could be related to an affinity for the crown chakra. Or it could be the results of more kundalini awakenings due to the 1st chakra. Or women could have more awakenings for some reason and just keep it to themselves more.
<br>
<br>
These tendencies also would show why women tend to reach the middle-ground more often, through the increase in activity in chakras 2, 4, and 6. And men may peak more frequently.
<br>
<br>
Please note that in all of this I am speaking to tendencies I have observed, and that they frequently differ from person to person. I know I have a blocked throat chakra (I just can't seem to get past the desire not to say things I know will offend, even to stick up for myself.) Any tendencies of our biological and etheric bodies in the end can be overcome and balanced.
<br>

I'd say the male guru thing extends to the fact that they're better at convincing people they're gurus in a patriarchal society. You don't need a strong crown chakra to be called a guru.

Certainly won't argue that point. And I haven't exactly seen anything that points to relative statistics of men and women with kundalini awakenings.

Men or women....
<br>
<br>
I dont know. I've heard women are better when they start, but after a long time men become better.
<br>
<br>
Doesnt make much sense to me. I dont use my body to do the most-psychic things. Maybe its the connection the body allows, so my brain can tell me what it wants.

<br>
There are around 200 people practicing Kundalini meditation in my town (I mean the ones who are established yogis and are doing this regularly and have clear results). And, indeed, the percentage of women is bigger, sometimes towards 2/1. But I wouldn't say that this in an end result, rather, when starting mediation we would focus more on the healing and balancing part, because this is what we are able to feel in the beginning. And this might appeal more to women. The philosophical insight develops as the next step, so, I believe that, as humanity is shifting towards the easiness of spiritual understanding, men will also be more involved in this.
<br>
Also, women will seek emotional and psychic balance, whereas men are to ensure material stability... so women might have a stronger sense for the non-material. (I hope that nobody will be offended
<img alt=":wink:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
!)
<br>
<br>
Still, I wouldn't say that women are better in the beginning, but men become better in the process. Rather, when balanced and natural, women have a more developed left parasympathetic (right brain hemisphere), they are more like the potential force, they act from inside towards outside, and men are the kinetic force, a stronger right parasympathetic, they draw the conclusions, so to say...
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
. that's why people see them first, and think that they have done the entire job. Also, that's why some say that women are the inspiration, because it is felt that they provide a great amount of that consciousness, which men will then express.
