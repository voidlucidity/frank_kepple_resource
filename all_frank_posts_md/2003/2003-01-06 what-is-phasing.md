<section>
Hi there, I'm new to the forum and am really glad to have found it!
<br>
<br>
I've had a number of OBE's, lucid dreams, and trance/vibration experiences but I'm fairly new to OBE literature and technique terms.
<br>
<br>
Could someone please tell me what "phasing" is? Does it have something to do with The Monroe Institute's Gateway technique?  If so, could someone also briefly explain what the Gateway system is about?
<br>
<br>
I'm eager to find new ways for developing OBE ability, especially ways to effectively and efficiently enter the trance state.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone had success using hemi-sync music?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help and time!
<br>
<br>
Cheers
<br>
Paul

I've been searching around the forums looking for answers.  There's so much jargon I don't understand.
<br>
<br>
It seems as though there are two kinds of experiences people are talking about (and probably more): The OOBE and Phasing.
<br>
<br>
What is the difference between the two?
<br>
<br>
Cheers

Let me take a stab at this one. This is what I have learnt (which may not be 100% accurate, mind you, so everyone else pls feel free to correct me).
<br>
<br>
OBE is where you actually perceive yourself as separate from your physical body, ie., you can even look back at your physical body. Separation is typically preceded by the sensation of vibrations.  This made up Monroe's experiences in Journeys Out of the Body.
<br>
From what I've observed, when you detach from your body using this 'classic' method of OBE, you (always?) first get into the "Real Time Zone", the level closest to the physical level which looks almost identical to it (ie., this is the level where you can perceive your physical body). From there, you can 'move' on to different levels (which makes up the bulk of Monroe's experiences in his second book, Far Journeys).
<br>
Robert Bruce and William Buhlman (2 other reknown OBE authors) also do it this way.
<br>
<br>
Phasing seems a little less simple to explain, as there seems to be different types of it.
<br>
In short, I believe phasing is the ability to tune your mind so that you can perceive the other dimensions, like a radio tuner. It does not involve 'leaving the body' as such, and all the while you have no doubt that you are still within your physical body.  This method seems faster to achieve.
<br>
<br>
There seems to be at least 2 different ways to experience phasing. There's a method developed by Bruce Moen (see his website and books), which has the advantage of being much more easily done, but the disadvantage of the person (at least initially) not being totally sure whether he/she had just made it all up in his/her mind.  With this method, you use your imagination first, and wait for things to 'happen' which you did not anticipate. This is probably an oversimplication so others pls share.
<br>
Then I think there's another type, where what you perceive is very real-like, full color 3-D sort of. I think I accidentally bumped into this type a few weeks back, but could only hold it for 1 minute or so.
<br>
Monroe himself spoke of a "quick-switch" method, which he used most of the time later (I think throughout the Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey books).  His Gateway Experience tapes/CDs, which take you through different "Focus" levels, are designed to achieve astral projection via phasing.
<br>
<br>
I'm still a newbie in this area, so I too would like to know how accurate/inaccurate my above understanding of the situation is.

Frank and Adrian are the local experts on phasing, which is more advanced than just astral projection. It is a way of experiencing the astral planes and higher more directly. Robert Monroe started out having out of body experiences but he then moved on to referring to levels of the astral as states of consciousness (F23, F27). Focus 23 through focus 27 are places where dead people can be found. I learned a little about these from an interview on Bruce Moen on the Art Bell show. Phasing sounds to me like seeing access to astral planes as states of consciousness instead of another body on another level of existence.

Phasing was first coined by Monroe and basically describes a process of tuning out of the physical and tuning into the Astral. Whereas the traditional obe route involves the creation of an "energy body" where you have the sensation of leaving your physical body and entering what is generally known as the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
So basically, with obe, you end up floating in your bedroom looking down at your physical body and all that jazz. Whereas, with Phasing there is no sensation of leaving your body at all. It basically feels like you are you, in the exact same body, only your surroundings changed from Physical to Astral.
<br>
<br>
Traditional obe generally incorporates the use of an "exit technique" which a person uses to help perceive themselves as being separate from their physical body. Successful "exit" is often accompanied by all manner of sounds and vibrations. Whereas, Phasing involves the experiencing of a step-by-step rundown of subtly different mental states which Monroe called Focus Levels. Generally, the phasing process (if performed correctly) is a smooth transition with next to no unusual sounds or vibrations.
<br>
<br>
With obe, as I say, you generally enter the real-time zone where it is possible to observe events happening in real-time within the Physical plane (hence the term real-time zone). However, the RT zone extends way beyond our Physical earth to the extent where it actually encompasses all Physical matter. Also, within this realm, it is possible to view what are known as Astral Plane Entrance structures of the kind described in Astral Dynamics (which are really amazing to see and to travel through!). Whereas, with Phasing, the normal destination is to project directly to the Astral.
