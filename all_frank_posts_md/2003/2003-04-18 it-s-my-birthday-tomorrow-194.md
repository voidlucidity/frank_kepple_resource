Well, I reckon I've now reached the point where birthdays have become an inconvenience rather than cause for celebration. 45 is not a number I thought I'd ever reach when in my teens. So for any youngsters reading this, I tell you, it happens! Though the consolation is, it's not at all as scary as it may seem from your perspective. The mind sort-of resigns itself to the inevitable.

That doesn't sound particularly old to me, from my perspective at 28. Do you really mean that you were planning to die before reaching 45? Fortunately it didn't happen and you don't seem disappointed.
<br>
<br>
Happy birthday.

If it's any consolation, I will be 47 in three weeks time - I hope we are living proof that there is hope for the youngsters here yet [

Regardless of age, physical time does go by fast, and it is up to each and every one to make the most of your reason for this lifetime.

As far as I am concerned, you are all toddlers.....my next one will
<br>
be 70.  It shakes me up to think it, let alone type it.
<br>
Where did the years go?  Make them all count people.  I'm not
<br>
getting older, I just keep getting better. [

i read a carlos castenada book once where don jaun was talking about why he was so old but still so healthy.  he was talking to carlos about how he never agreed to get old and therefore his body had to comply.  i think his exact words were ' i never agreed to get old'. kind of mind over matter.  he may have then went on to say that most people already 'know' that they are going to be old and when they get old they succumb to old characteristics.  i'm not old enough yet to have any experience w/ this but i keep it in mind as much as possible.  i don't really believe in celebrating birthdays anymore but i will reckognize that it's your bday and wish you a happy day.

Thank you for all your best wishes both on this thread and in the PM's. A great day was had by all, though a few of my friends did over indulge to the extent where they still haven't surfaced!

Thanks again.

LOL: not exactly planning to, Tom. But I once had a fascination with motorcycles and used to race them at Club level as a hobby. I had my share of spills and, like most people who engage in this activity, have stared death in the face quite a number of times. I always thought I'd die on a bike.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays all that's behind me. I still have a machine but no-longer ride it on the public highway as it's too crowded and too dangerous. But I still do track-days when the mood takes me.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

A belated (or very very early) Happy Birthday to you Frank.
<br>
<br>
I remember as a young teenager thinking about how old I would be when the year 2000 came around. I'd be in my 30's!! That was just too far away to bare contemplating.
<br>
<br>
Now I'm 36 and trying to remember what happened in 2000 doesn't bare contemplating.

Hi James S !
<br>
<br>
funny that - I must've been about 10 or 11 and I remember clearly thinking to myself "I'll be 24 in the year 2000". I remember being slightly worried by this thought at the time, because I knew that I'd have to cook my own meals and do my own washing !
