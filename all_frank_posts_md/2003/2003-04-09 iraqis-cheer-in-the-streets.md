<section>
Everytime I read these articles and see the images of Iraqis cheering in the streets it makes me realize how much these people are grateful to be liberated from the Butcher of Baghdad and his terrible, violent regime.  Now it's America's job to hurry up, finish up, rebuild infrastructure, assure that there is an honest gov't in place and GET OUT.

CROWDS CHEER IN BAGHDAD STREETS
<br>
11:00 - 09 April 2003
<br>
<br>
Jubilant crowds welcomed US Marines in eastern Baghdad today as Saddam Hussein's reign appeared to be ending.
<br>
<br>
And the centre of the capital was eerily quiet, with regime officials melting away and little evidence of any fighting. BBC correspondent Rageh Omaar said there were "dramatic reports" coming in from the east of the city.
<br>
<br>
"There is looting of government stores, people going out into the streets without seemingly any fear, chanting anti-government slogans.
<br>
<br>
"Really government control has ebbed away," he said.
<br>
<br>
There were reports of no police on the streets of the city.
<br>
<br>
Allied forces were tightening their grip on the city today and made further inroads in the north and south of the country.
<br>
<br>
U.S troops entered Baghdad from the north for the first time and U.S Marines moved deeper into the city from the east.
<br>
<br>
The jubilant scenes were in Saddam City, a poor Shiite district in the east of the capital, where Marines were clapped and cheered, according to reports.
<br>
<br>
Iraq's Shiites have suffered persecution at the hands of Saddam's regime.
<br>
------------------------------------
<br>
Dancing in Baghdad streets
<br>
<br>
Hundreds of Iraqi civilians danced and cheered in the streets of Baghdad today as Saddam Hussein's iron grip on the city was finally broken.
<br>
<br>
Looters raided the administration`s offices, abandoned shops and government residences in the capital, taking furniture and food.
<br>
<br>
In parts of Baghdad, men, women and their children were pictured cheering and giving ``victory`` signs to foreign TV cameras.
<br>
<br>
One man, who appeared to be in his late 50s, tore down a picture of Saddam Hussein wearing his trademark military beret and sunglasses.
<br>
<br>
In a mark of the dramatic changes that were sweeping the city, the man took off his shoe and used it to beat the image of the dictator`s face openly in the street.
<br>
<br>
``This is the criminal, this is the infidel,`` he said.
<br>
<br>
``This is the destiny of every traitor ... he killed millions of us. Oh people, this is freedom.``
<br>
<br>
The man continued to beat the image of Saddam with his shoe - an act considered to be a great insult in the Arab world.
<br>
<br>
Others joined in, pulling at the picture and kicking the canvas until it was ripped loose from its buckled wooden frame and torn into strips.
<br>
<br>
According to reports, government officials fled the city earlier in the day, and Saddam`s controversial information minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf cancelled his morning press briefing.
<br>
<br>
Some areas of Baghdad east of the River Tigris remained eerily quiet, and were still in the control of Saddam`s loyalists, according to Sky News reporter David Chater.
<br>
<br>
``This is perhaps one of the last pockets where the Americans have yet to reach and there`s still quite a lot of armed resistance,`` he said.
<br>
<br>
But elsewhere, men, women and children ran and danced in Baghdad`s dusty streets, carrying office chairs, sacks of grain and other supplies on their backs.
<br>
<br>
They stood in the sunshine beside the bombed shells of official Iraqi buildings - the now gutted, lifeless symbols of Saddam`s rule.
<br>
<br>
Children grinned and gave thumbs-up signs to TV cameras in the city.
<br>
<br>
Paul Wood, BBC World correspondent in Baghdad, said looting was happening across the east of the city.
<br>
<br>
``People are now adjusting to the new realities which we are seeing on the streets of Baghdad about a kilometre away,`` he said.
<br>
<br>
He said locals who claimed to be ``in charge`` of the uprising had told him they did not want the Americans to run their city.
<br>
<br>
``The `leader of our revolution`, one of the Shias, told me `We don`t want the Americans here. We are glad that Saddam has gone, we see this now as an opportunity to take control of our own lives`.``
<br>
<br>
ITV`s John Irvine, said by the channel to be the first reporter to meet US Marines in Baghdad, said Iraqis were hurling stones at pictures of Saddam outside the HQ of the secret police.
<br>
<br>
Others were dousing the images in petrol and setting them ablaze, displaying extreme pleasure in doing so, according to Irvine.
<br>
<br>
Irvine asked one of the Marines in the city how it felt to be there.
<br>
<br>
The soldier replied: ``Pretty good. It`s nice to represent marines here. We entered Baghdad last night, but have just got to the centre now. The reception has been great.``
<br>
<br>
For the first time foreign journalists working in Baghdad were able to work without being monitored by Iraqi officials.
<br>
<br>
TV pictures showed US soldiers seemingly at ease as they walked along roadsides, many with their rifles dropped to their sides.
<br>
<br>
Other scenes showed hundreds of Iraqis waving their guns in the air, while those without weapons took up branches and waved their clothing in displays of approval.
<br>
<br>
Ian Glover James, a reporter for ITV in Baghdad, said the scenes of celebration and looting had turned ``ugly`` in some places.
<br>
<br>
``Initially (it was) very good-natured. We saw a crowd ransacking what had been a government intelligence headquarters.
<br>
<br>
``They were coming out with office furniture, office chairs, bottles of Chivas Regal whisky and other fine blends of drinks normally unseen here in Baghdad.
<br>
<br>
``But on our return on the way out, the scene had turned rather more ugly.
<br>
<br>
``There was a man standing in the middle of the road with a very heavy calibre machine gun, the kind of thing that`s mounted on an armoured vehicle normally.
<br>
<br>
``There was at least one corpse on the ground and it did look like the crowd that had been busy looting had had an altercation and gunfire had ensued.``
<br>
<br>
Among the chants being shouted by the jubilant citizens of Baghdad were ``Saddam is god`s enemy``, and other reports said Iraqis were also shouting ``Good, good Bush``.
<br>
<br>
As news of the jubilation in Baghdad spread across Iraq, civilians in Basra and Arbil joined in celebrations of their own.
<br>
<br>
In a pooled despatch from Basra, Keith Harrison, of Wolverhampton`s Express &amp; Star, said pictures of the Iraqi dictator ``were defaced on street corners``.
<br>
<br>
Despite rumours of Baath Party officials observing the crowd, the men were finally confident enough to speak out, he said.
<br>
<br>
Abal Malam Al Fussah, a 28-year-old English student from Al Zubayr, told Harrison: ``We have waited many years for this.
<br>
<br>
``Saddam is evil and he has gone. He killed Muslims, his own people and stole our money to buy palaces and cars and guns.``
<br>
<br>
And, drawing a finger across his throat to cheers from the crowd, he added: ``He must pay the full price.``
<br>
<br>
The scenes of celebration spread to Arbil in northern Iraq, where crowds of men gathered to cheer and wave, holding aloft pictures of their Kurdish leader.
<br>
<br>
US and British officials cautiously welcomed the news.
<br>
<br>
But coalition commanders warned that there could still be significant opposition and more fierce battles as loyalist fighters continued to defend Baghdad.

TV images of crumbling regime cheer Iraqi-Americans
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br>
<br>
<br>
Iraqis in Michigan paraded through the streets waving American and Iraqi flags, while others around the nation greeted signs that Saddam Hussein's regime is crumbling with tears of joy.
<br>
Worries about relatives in their homeland persisted, but a wave of relief washed over many in the Iraqi-American community Wednesday as they saw news reports of collapsing opposition to U.S. troops in Baghdad.
<br>
<br>
"This is a day we've been waiting for 35 years," said Feisal Amin Al-Istrabadi, a Chicago lawyer who went in late to work after watching events unfold on television. "It's a tremendous relief that it seems that this is the beginning of the end. I'm very, very proud to be an American today, as well as an Iraqi."
<br>
<br>
In Dearborn, Mich., a crowd of about 200 people and dozens of honking cars paraded by the Karbalaa Islamic Center in the largely Arab Detroit suburb.
<br>
<br>
Some people stood on car roofs, others chanted slogans in Arabic, including "Hey hey, Saddam, hey Saddam, where are you going to escape to?" and "Saddam is dead, long live Iraq." At one point, the crowd used candy to pelt a large cardboard drawing of Saddam, took the picture out into the street, jumped on it and eventually tore it in half.
<br>
<br>
"Today is my birthday," said Ali Al-Ghazali, 46, a native of southern Iraq. "But it's also the birthday for all Iraqis."
<br>
<br>
Salah Flaih, who decorated his Manchester, N.H., convenience store with American flags and a life-sized cardboard cutout of President Bush, hopped up and down as he watched television images of U.S. Marines and Iraqis topple a 40-foot statue of Saddam that stood in the center of Baghdad's Fardos Square.
<br>
<br>
"Oh, the Iraqi people are happy now," said Flaih, 49, who moved to New Hampshire with his wife and sons 2 1/2 years ago. "It's the happiest moment in my life. It's my liberation day."
<br>
<br>
In Lincoln, Neb., Omar Younis watched the same images. "It's exciting, it's very great," said Younis, who has family living in Mosul. "I wish I was there to participate with the people."
<br>
<br>
Ithaar Derweesh, who hasn't been able to sleep more than three hours a night since the war started, said he woke up early to "the adrenaline rush of watching history unfold," seeing television images of people throwing flowers at American tanks, waving flags and removing symbols of Saddam's regime.
<br>
<br>
"It's beautiful," said Derweesh, 32, a Cleveland surgeon whose family left Iraq when he was 9 years old. "I cried tears of joy."
<br>
<br>
But not all Iraqi-Americans shared those feelings. Hadi Jawad, vice president and board member of the Dallas Peace Center, said he sees coalition forces not as liberators, but as subjugators of Iraq's people and resources.
<br>
<br>
"They have resorted to war, to violence, to killing thousands of Iraqi civilians," he said. "The means they have resorted to to accomplish the removal of the regime is unconscionable. It's a criminal act."
<br>
<br>
As Iraqi-Americans watched the looting in the streets of Baghdad, they also are concerned about relatives living there, and whether they have electricity or running water.
<br>
<br>
"I'd like to see calm restored," said Al-Istrabadi, whose cousins, aunts and uncles live in Iraq. "One of my nephews is 20 years old. He has never known a regime other than Saddam's. So this is where the future of Iraq lies — how are they going to be able to engender and maintain these democratic institutions?"
<br>
<br>
Now, the hard work begins, said Al-Istrabadi, who is vice president for legal affairs at the Iraqi Forum for Democracy.
<br>
<br>
"The liberation of Baghdad is in many respects the easy part," he said. "How do you go about reconstructing a civil society? How do you go about reintroducing the rule of law? While I'm optimistic about the future, I also realize that it's going to be a herculean effort."

What you said is interesting MJ-12,
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Isaiah 17:1 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
 <br>
 2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
 <br>
 3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.
 <br>
</i>
<br>
<br>
A popular prophecy in the bible is that Damascus will be destroyed completely so who knows whats in store for the middle east.

You cannot trust anything in the press about the war at the moment, about 90% it complete fabrication. I read a very good article on this and have been looking for it with no luck, but ever the BBC are getting really quite annoyed. Example 1: We were told they had taken Basra 9 times at the count of the articles writing, which must have been over a week ago. Complete BS. Example 2: Recently heard that Saddams hundreds of tanks had been reduced to estimated 17 (rather exact don't you think?) - I predict that this too, is utter rubbish. We would have heard about it and seen pictures of the amassed wreckage, but we have not. Only one of two, here and there, made to look like big breakthroughs.
<br>
I could go on, but there are numerous examples of flagrant lying and propaganda - on both sides, of course. It is interesting and quite enlightening to watch for them.
<br>
From what I can tell, I am afraid we still haven't seen the main battles - the Iraqi army is hundreds of thousands strong. As I see it (very, very limited vision!) current battles have involved at the very most a few thousand. Eg hosiptals in Baghdad are talking about being stretched in capacity with hundreds of wounded, if the main forces (many of which are likely to be hiding in the capital) had been employed by now, there would be many, many thousand of casualties.
<br>
The Iraqis are purposefully using strange tactics. It is entirely possible that they are trying to lull the invading army into a sense of false security, and using Baghdad as a trap, although I am not sure they are well enough organised, trained or equipted to be able to pull that off. I shouldn't think it would be too hard though, it is their city, after all, and they have had ample time to prepare. Of course, I could be wildly wrong.
<br>
<br>
I would strongly advise against simply believing one point of view, especially when emotions are strong - the info coming from the pentagon is bad enough and *then* the media spin it even worst.
<br>
The best site I have found so far for news is

</a>
<br>
They seem quite impartial to all this and appear to be trying to put down the facts as they are, without all the emotional gabble of the popular press. Good old Russians!! A dependable people.
<br>
<br>
all the best

People were cheering in the streets I believe that much.
<br>
<br>
If The U.S. was defeated and our soldiers had to go home there would be people in the streets cheering.
<br>
<br>
Does a group of people in the streets cheering mean all iraqi's or even most are grateful we're bombing their cities?
<br>
<br>
There are people in our streets protesting.. does that mean we're all against war.
<br>
<br>
I dont think you can assume we did the right thing because a group of people were cheering.  Im sure there were many attending funerals too.
<br>
<br>
Course people will do it anyway.  Its nice when we can see people cheering though and feel good about what we did. It makes the masses happy.  And those without the burden of deciding to look at all stories not just the ones fed to us to make the U.S. pat itself on the back for so selflessly liberating this country.

Inguma wrote: "You cannot trust anything in the press about the war at the moment, about 90% it complete fabrication."  Whoa, that number seems a little high to me buddy.  I don't think much news is FABRICATED, which means compeltely made up.  Maybe they put a spin on it, but made up?  I believe that most journalists, especially those imbedded, are reporting the truth.  Those guys are straight up FANATICAL about objectivity and truth.  I mean, Al-Jezeera and the Iraqi minister of info, now those guys fabricate information.  Up till just a few days ago the Iraqi minister of info was saying the US were not even in Iraq!  Ha!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think it's too bad how both sides of any issue try to cover up the truth or twist it to make them look good.  I do think, however, that these days much of what is reported is generally true and if you read between the lines you can get at what's really going on.
<br>
<br>
Conspiracy theories abound and they are usually more off then even the most wacky news agencies.
<br>
<br>
About American causalties in Afghanistan, 1200 US casualities seems a bit high...I am trying to find more info on that

I asked a buddy is was in the military and keeps up on the info about Afghanistan and here's what he said (and mind you this is just off the cuff, opinion):
<br>
<br>
Probably from Azzam.com.Or jhiadunspun. they tend to post a few dozen US deaths evry week.all with no tally casulties.
<br>
According to these channels of info, The "mhujadeen"in these attacks are brave and devout,the yanks run round like headless chickens firing wildly causing no kills,and the "Mujadeen" vanish immune to US surveillance,The episode is always followed by "massive indiscriminate bombing" which kills only innocent farmers.
<br>
<br>
"I think the freindly deaths all told from Op enduring freedom is apx 3 KIA,perhaps triple that WIA all all causes.Perhaps even 2 or 3 MIA's.
<br>
This is just my speculation,I tried running all the major fights through TNDM,and came out with nearly 1000 US/UK casulties for all causes &amp; all States.This seems a bit much to cover up!
<br>
<br>
BTW.Did you know that according to Azzam,the Coalition has lost over 120 helicopters!

 How does your brother feel about the Canadian arm forces? I have written my MP saying we should be spending our money on our arm forces. Of course being as I am, you can imagine it is because I want them to be able to do their job as peacekeepers.

<br>
<br>
He feels they have excellent soldiers, just really bad equipment. At the moment he's in ottawa(born in newfoundland) and all his friends said they wanted to be in Iraq already but thanks to chretian it was not so. There is a canadian military presence over there though which is kinda strange.

Hey, don't trash Al Jazeera.  I've been reading their english website and I've found nothing wrong with it at all.  It's no different than reading any left-leaning U.S. website or magazine.  Don't trash it until you try it:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://english.aljazeera.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://english.aljazeera.net
</a>
<br>
<br>
I believe that if you listen intently to both sides, you get the best overall idea of what's really going on.  In this Iraq case, you may be sure all KINDS of things are going on, both positive and negative.  Some of the Iraqis love us, some hate us.
<br>
<br>
Read the war diaries on
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.bbc.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.bbc.com
</a>
- - - first hand accounts of what's happening.  Or read the essays on
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.npr.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.npr.org
</a>
. . . I especially liked one essay where a journalist wrote of one young U.S. Marine's confusion:   The Iraqis were cheering him and clapping and joyfully dancing, but they were also showing him the bottoms of their feet, a huge insult.  Also, in Iraq and other Arab countries, the thumbs-up sign means "up yours."  Please be sure they know what they are doing by sending us their mixed messages.
<br>
<br>
Arabs worldwide are confused, conflicted, happy, sad, angry, joyful, vindicated, demoralized - - - you name it, they are feeling it.  Don't try to dump them all in the same camp, they are all over the place politically.
<br>
<br>
George Bush and Tony Blair are on trial now, and they know it.  So let's hope they backpeddal on their imperialist plans and give a good enough show for the Arab nations to have history judge them well.

  I would strongly advise against simply believing one point of view, especially when emotions are strong - the info coming from the pentagon is bad enough and *then* the media spin it even worst.

About Al Jezeera, what a freakin' joke...while one might gain valuable insights into how others think and feel, one thing you won't get from them is any objectivity, I mean they have pictures of little kids with bomber superimposed on the image....to me it's like 1920's propoganda or something.  Maybe other news ources are guilty of not being objective, but at least they do a better job of covering it up!

About the accuracy of the press, well exactly how accurate is the tripe coming from the Iraqi Sinister for Disinformation?
<br>
<br>
As to the general acuracy of the media, roughly 10 years ago one of the Uni's in Australia produced some report that stated only approximately 20% of what comes out of the various forms of news media is accurate.
<br>
At least thats what
<i>
 their
</i>
report stated
<br>
<br>
As to who's going to look after Iraq, the Aussie papers have been boasting that Australia is going to have the key role in assisting the reformation of the government of Iraq.
<br>
At least thats what the media says.

Believe it........or not!

"They WERE. Most have defected, surrendered, or been killed."
<br>
Oh? Well, foolish me! How about pointing me in the direction of, say, a photo of a few of tens of thousand of Iraqis surrendering then? If they have been surrendering en mass, the popular press would be screaming it out....but....
<br>
or if they had been just dropping arms and running, we would have seen the columns of deserters leaving baghdad but....well, they probably learned not to desert the Iraqi army after the US bombed and killed so many thousands of deserters on the "highway of death" last war.
<br>
<br>
"You betcha. There's just NO WAY that the reports could be fabricated to the extent you seem to believe possible. "
<br>
Why not? Journalists who are not imbedded get beaten and escorted out of the country like those poor Portugese blokes a while back. And the ones who are imbedded (ALL the popular press ones) are shown only what the military want to show them, which is not a whole lot, and so the press relies almost totally on news from the pentagon and london when it comes to anything important ie not just getting pretty pictures of statues of saddam statues being toppled, but actually looking at the larger picture. The embedded journalists get to see a very small part of the human side, what its like for soldiers. Thats all.
<br>
Further have the constant threat of censorship and being chucked from the country, should they step out of line. I mean, seriously, what journalist is going to write anything bad about the war when they are surrounded by marines who read their every word? It stinks.
<br>
<br>
"Yeah, the old publishers of Pravda! Sure can trust THEM for the truth! Do you really believe this?"
<br>
Hey!! I like Pravda!!!
<br>
I trust them more than the popular press, which told you about "crowds of cheering Iraqis". What they didn't tell you:
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.iraqwar.ru/iraq-read_article.php?articleId=2561&amp;lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
The bigger picture counts:

 http://www.iraqwar.ru/iraq-read_article.php?articleId=2559⟨=en
</a>
<br>
<br>
I am sticking to my guns with 90% fabrication. This comes from actual EVIDENCE rather than postulation. Even I was totally shocked by the amount of BS being released.
<br>
Like I said, at the time of the articles writing I read (which I still cant find!! ggrr!!) Basra had been taken 9 times. If it was then taken properly that leaves....90% fabrication, like I said. However, it is more than like that they lied another say, 5 times, before it was actually taken, which would give us 94% rubbish.
<br>
Then there were the chemical "weapons" which were found and touted so loudly. Eeeerrmm - pesticide?! Damn those Iraqis for killing insects!!! Murderers!!!!!!!!! hehehe. I could go on.
<br>
<br>
But, if you want to get emotional, try the other side of the coin, the REAL human cost:

! ha ha....I got that picture in my e-mail too... the title was "Just Joking !"
<br>
<br>
Now that the war appears to be coming to a conclusion (I don't believe that the iraqi troops believe in their cause, in the same way that the koreans and viets did) perhaps we can start invading a few more countries, eh ?
<br>
<br>
I'm not particularly happy with the way the Burmese are running their country - lets invade them. Also, I don't particularly like the governments of Nigeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morroco ( continue through 50% of the African countries)....Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Turkey....Move back to Asia and we can mention China, Phillipines, India &amp; Pakistan...over in Europe, a couple spring to mind, N. Ireland / UK , Romania, Serbia....
<br>
<br>
I could go on. Why should we invade these countries ? Well, "they have links with terrorism".....no, wait..."errr.. they have weapons of mass destruction. Well, maybe they don't, but they want them."......hmmmmm, that doesn't really sound tenable. How about "Yes, we're doing it for the people, we are setting them free". Yes, that'll win them over.
<br>
<br>
Why don't I believe the variety of reasons given to us by the USA and UK governments ? It should be blantantly obvious.
<br>
<br>
At the tube station yesterday a lady tried to give me a leaflet saying " this war is being fought in your name, do something about it". However I didn't take the leaflet because if the biggest peaceful demonstration in UK history can't change the government's direction then that leaflet won't either.

<section>
Yeah I'm back Frank!  My home has a new roof, ceiling, floor, carpet paint . . . whew . . . also, from the perspective of a Defense employee I've been glued to the Internet and the evening news. I  keep checking for some kind of breakthrough, hoping I'll go online  and see the words "And they lived happily ever after, The End," on my computer screen.  Fat chance, but I keep hoping.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, as to the media, I really don't think individual reporters lie.  Networks "spin," but reporters tend to simply report.  Unfortunately reporters see reality as through a drinking straw . . . . one little bit of the action, and then the Network spins reporters' stories into the Lie that this is all that's happening (i.e., Al Jazeera and its photos of dead/injured children), or that it's NOT happening by refusing to show it (i.e., Syria did not show the happy dancing Iraquis taking down the Saddam imagery).
<br>
<br>
Something I noticed that I bet a lot of people didn't:  Many journalists got the video footage of the man slapping the big poster of Saddam with his shoe.  They probably also filmed the guy lifting up his caftan to pee on the photo.   However, none of the U.S. TV stations showed the guy lifting his clothes to pee . . . but the BBC sure did.
<br>
<br>
My point:  I think U.S. TV stations draw the line at certain distateful things (i.e., they won't show blood, urine, too much nudity, etc.). As a result, they get accused of glossing over the "truth" or being prudish or whatever.  But I think TV stations in the U.S. are afraid of angry people calling the station to complain.   I wonder if TV stations in other countries have to worry about this sort of thing . . . individuals and groups threatening to boycott advertised products if TV stations show too much gore, bodily fluids or smut while they are trying to eat dinner with the kids.
<br>
<br>
The moral of the story:  Be a news slut. Get around!  Watch and read indiscriminately! Then draw your own conclusions.  If you're convinced that only one version of the "truth" should enter your mind, and read only Pravda or The Nation or the NY Times or whatever . . . then admit that you're completely deluded.
<br>
<br>
At any rate, the U.S. military in Iraq had better start imposing some law and order, the looting over there is disgraceful.  It's certainly not winning the U.S. any compassion "points."  And where is all this humanitarian aid that's been promised?  How hard is it to dig a g*dd*mn well and get some clean water flowing?
