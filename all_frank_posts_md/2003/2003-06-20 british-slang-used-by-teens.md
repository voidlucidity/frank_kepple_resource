<section>
Hi guys and gals,
<br>
<br>
I have a few British teens in my novel.  The dialogue does not include accents (too afraid of messing it up) but I want to throw sayings or slang into their dialogue.  Below is a short list. Could any of you UKers let me know whether:
<br>
- these are still used?
<br>
- the meanings right?
<br>
I am curious what you hear teens say.
<br>
<br>
Now remember I have evil guys in this novel so I can have some insulting phrases here as long as they don't have any sexual connotations...if you know what I mean.
<br>
<br>
Dead cert - dead certain
<br>
Gormless Wuss - silly person? ( I really liked this saying )
<br>
knackered - very tired?
<br>
beast - ugly
<br>
brill - for brilliant or excellent ( I like this )
<br>
cabbage - for someone slow or foolish
<br>
<br>
Thanks!
<br>

<section>
Dead cert - dead certain
<br>
I've never used it but I assume that's what it means.
<br>
Gormless Wuss - silly person? ( I really liked this saying )
<br>
Well...wuss is very common, and means 'coward' or 'chicken' Gormless is pretty irrelevant, and I've never heard it next to wuss. Means stupid or blank.
<br>
knackered - very tired?
<br>
Yes. Always used.
<br>
beast - ugly
<br>
Sometimes.
<br>
brill - for brilliant or excellent ( I like this )
<br>
No. That's so famous five.
<br>
cabbage - for someone slow or foolish
<br>
.....never heard of that use before.
<br>
<br>
Hope I've been of help! [|)]

<br>
Thank you very much! [

] Are there sayings you do hear all the time?
<br>
I am eager find British sayings said in surprise or disgust (but have no sexual connotation).  Really hope you can help me some more.
<br>
<br>
Many Thanks,

Timeless,
<br>
<br>
If your interested I would suggest checking out the following movies.
<br>
<br>
"Lock, Stock, &amp; Two Smoking Barrels"
<br>
"Snatch"
<br>
"Formula 51"
<br>
<br>
They have loads and loads of various phrases.  I don't know what a lot of them mean or if they would be okay to use, but you would be able to pick some out and then check on certain terms.

If you get some English words I'll tell you what they mean [|)] I'm not really sure which are the ones that are English-only, we use mostly the same stuff as Americans. I think the word 'bloody' as in a swear word is fairly English though. e.g. "You bloody fool!" It's quite mild, but if you want your writing to be aimed at a young audience p'raps not.

Hello Timeless
<br>
You could log on to the UK teen chats on msn and maybe throw some wording in there to gauge there reactions, phrasing and sentence formation. The only UK slag I can think of is "bollocks" but I'm geting old, lol so it might be dated.[

Thanks guys for the good ideas.  A big writer's conference will be held in mid October -- emphasis on fantasy and Si-Fi. Editors, authors and agents strongly linked to the Si-Fi industry will be attending.  Turns out a literary agent with these strong ties is what I need -- awww the taggled web.  Things are always more complicated then they first seem. Anywho, I plan to be ready for this conference -- with help from my friends.
<br>
<br>
Many Thanks, Much Appreciated![

Also along with bollocks you can also say shite, instead of sh*t. Although it has to be said that both are swear words. If somebody is going somewhere, eg to the shops they could say "I'm just popping out tp the shops", or "I'm just nipping out to the shops."

<section>
Oooooh a very common way of saying "hello" over here would be "alright mate" - which doesn't necessitate an answer ie its not necessarily a question. Simply the same replied back is acceptable. Shortens to "aight"/"a'right"/"all-right" - use more for the answer, could be the question.
<br>
Hehe I was listening to David Icke on coast to coast and some american asked him "hey how are you david" and he replied with "alright mate!" which totally confused the american caller. Small pause, then more forcefully he repeated himself "how are you doing david??!?" lol and then noory stepped in.
<br>
Also "alright mate how's it going?" and etc.
<br>
"Muppit" for referring to clueless person. "gormless wuss" - as said, gormless is good, wuss is less used but possible.
<br>
Hope this helps
<br>

'Wanker' is the best English word American's don't understand.
<br>
<br>
Someone on the credits for Buffy the Vampire Slayer was called Thomas Wanker - which always caused much sniggering in our student digs.

Fortunately I knew what wanker meant.  A 'translation' is helpful though.  I will not be using terms like wanker since risking offending the editor is likely a tad unwise for a new writer.  Kids approximately 12 and up will be reading the book.
<br>
Many thanks again you guys.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Inguma,
<br>
<br>
You nailed exactly what I was looking for.  Why I like the word gormless so much I can't say.  What a great word though.

   I think there is a big problem with their being two (or more) derivations of the english language.  Say someone from britian aims me (happens all the time) and calls me "mate".  Now in america, "mate" means someone you are in a relationship with.  So that's all like non-cool-like.  Also some of your curse words would mean nothing to us, but what if I started saying them to some little kid because I thought they meant nothing?  And the little kid (who happens to be british) would go tell his mommy all the cool new words his american friend taught him. (heh.  out on a limb with this one
   <img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
   )  Whatever.  We have a british show over here now that should clear some of this up.  "Keen Eddie" is on Fox tuesdays in DC here.

That's funny. Your post, Squeek, reminds me of the times when, now and again, people in the US have said to me something like, "Gee, I just love your English accent.". Erm, I'm speaking English. It's you guys that have the accent.
