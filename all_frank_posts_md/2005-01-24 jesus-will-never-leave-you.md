<section>
Jesus is so Great that even death could not hold Him down! The grave held no power over Christ. Hallelujah and Praise the one that will free us from this prison! Serve Him with all your Heart and Mind and you will be caught up in the clouds to meet Him someday.
<br>
<br>
What a Glorious event!
<br>
<br>
The return of our redeemer!
<br>
<br>
Pray for your friends that they may be healed. Pray for your family that they may know Him through the Bible.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Psalm 23:4 (King James Version)
 <br>
 <br>
 4Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
 <br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
He will never leave you. Just pray for understanding and follow His Law. You will be happier, healthier and ready for Heaven!
<br>
<br>
Blessed be His name!

Christianity is the Path of the Heart.
<br>
<br>
The Bible is the compass for the transfomation of your old selfish nature to the one that Christ originally planned for us.

<section>
Soma-Sight,
<br>
<br>
Christianity is the path of one who cannot accept or create his or her own identity and definition of reality.
<br>
<br>
The Bible is a vast and resourceful book which can be interpreted many ways (as with any good literature) that was concievabley written before, after and without any direct creation by Christ.
<br>
<br>
I only consider myself selfish in ways of individuality, defining what reality means to me, not the self-centeredness of one whom is concerned with pleasing and satisfying only themselves. I percieve myself to be a positive, compassionate and accepting person, which is far less "selfish" by your terms, than you or your religion would lead you to believe.

Fair enough and I understand where you are coming from.

I just have one question.........

<br>
Do you believe in Satan? The devil, Lucifer, Â or in other words the deceiver of men?

Soma-Sight:
<br>
<br>
Not only Jesus but neither death nor the grave holds down any of us. I think the problem is at the time this chap was supposedly living, it appears only he knew that. Whereas today there are an ever growing number of people who have realised what he was trying to get across all that time ago.
<br>
<br>
Profanity is not something I wish to engage in. But I would like to stress that the ability Jesus is describing, or rather what you claim he is describing, is an ability open to all of us as part and parcel of our being. I'm not sure why I should be so thankful to this one person, therefore. If he were a member here I'd post something to the effect of, "Thanks a million for the tip Jesus old chum, it was really helpful, and sorry to hear about that little tussle you had with the Romans." And he'd come back and say, "No probs, Frank, yeah the old hands are still a bit stiff and the left shoulder gives me jip on cold mornings, but I'm getting there."
<br>
<br>
I'm sure he wouldn't then go on and start insisting we all "serve" him and all that jazz. I'm sure if Jesus was posting here he would come back to you and say, something to the effect of, you sorely misunderstood the jist of what he was trying to get across. Though I can fully appreciate your enthusiasm, as I know how rapturous it feels to have a special person in my life that I can totally believe in. But Jesus doesn't cut it for me.
<br>
<br>
It's funny you should pick that one particular quote, though, and it was the main reason why I responded. I haven't got a religious bone in my body, as I have said on this forum many times before, but I have read the bible. More out of curiosity than anything. I suppose I just wanted to see what all the fighting was about, ultimately. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil" is a sentence that always sticks in mind. It is ever so poetic and holds a meaning so deep it is almost unfathomable. Many writings in the bible are like that, so beautifully profound, the prosody the poetry, repeatedly held me in awe. So how can people fight over that? How misguided can people be?
<br>
<br>
But then again they
<i>
 objectify
</i>
everything, and that's when it all starts going wrong. Oh well.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

And download the first Mike Fearon interview. The sound files on this page are of people who are dead, with their voices manifested through the mediumship of Leslie Flint. He speaks a lot about Jesus.
<br>
<br>
Next George Briggs
<br>
<br>
After this, try David2 and Dr Cosmo Lang who was a former Archbishop of Canterbury. After this listen to everything else.

First of all when you are dead you are dead.
<br>
<br>
Those voices are demons.

Mediumship and channeling could also be known as "demon channels".

Mediumship is condemed by the Bible and is Satanic.

I should have said I am sorry for you that you have a closed mind, because if you listened you would have heard Mike says very good things about Jesus. Demon?
<br>
<br>
All the spirits are full of love and kindness and are desparate to teach the truth. Nothing evil or negative is ever said. Demons?
<br>
<br>
Aren't you worried that you dismiss something without listening/studying first. Do you realise even that your mind is closed? My mind is open, it doesn't mean I believe anything. I would have total respect for you if you listened and learned about the 40+ years of Leslie Flint's work, then decided it wasn't for you. Instead your close-minded response makes you look unintelligent.

If you listened to the FREE recording I gave you links to, you'd know the answer. It is often said that death is the most wonderful and exciting thing that we can look forward to. They wouldn't dream of coming back. The afterlife is wonderful. It is said in some of the recordings. The earth is just the start, death is completely an illusion.

Spirits wonder why we bother with organ transplants and trying to prolong life as long as possible. Knowing what they know, they think this is dumb. But you don't want to know any of this anyway Soma-Sight

Do not be decieved!

<br>
There is only One Way to Eternal Life.
<br>
<br>
ONE!
<br>
<br>
This is a false doctrine straight out of the mouth of hell.

<br>
Repent and believe in The Son of God. He is your only hope for the "afterlife".

Those recordings are DEMONS not dead people.

I'm not even a christian and i know the Bible better than you.

I dare you to take this test:

<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news0203/biblelogicquiz.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 The Bible Logic Quiz
</a>
<br>
<br>
I scored perfect 10 here.
<br>
<br>
And this test:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.bettybowers.com/newtest.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 The New "test" ament Inerrancy Quiz
</a>
<br>
<br>
And again my score in this test was 10.
<br>
<br>
One more test:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news0101/sciencequiz.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Creation Science Quiz
</a>
<br>
<br>
My score - ofcourse 10 out of 10.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How could i score so high ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was possible because i know one thing about the Bible that you obviously don't know.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess what it is ?
