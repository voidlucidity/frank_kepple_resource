HI, I'm Mags.  I'm into Reiki and meditation.
<br>
<br>
I have had a lot of weird experiences in my life, seeing, hearing and sensing 'things' and people that you would normally think are not there.  I shut myself off from these things many years ago for the sake of my kids because they were starting to see them as well, even though I had NEVER told them of my experiences.  Moveing house helped!
<br>
<br>
I now feel the need to understand and accept these things and if possible get back to them cos I feel that my life has gone flat and I am missing something - not sure what.
<br>
<br>
This is part of my search.
