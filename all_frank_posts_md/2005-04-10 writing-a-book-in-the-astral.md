I'm a novelist, and I am just starting out on a new book, but I'm facing massive writers block. I'm planning to plan out and write the book in a the astral state where my conscious mind will be subdued and my creative subconscious can work unhindered. I was just wondering if this was possible, and how I could conceivably transfer my work from the astral  to waking life, any suggestions?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
You are obviously not facing writer's block when it comes to littering the forum! The multiple duplicate posts you placed apart from this one, which I am about to move to Chat, will be deleted.

Yours,

Well what you could do is go into a lucid dream.  Then start writing a really good novel and just try to remember the title or something along those lines.  Then when you wake up go into a light trance and focus on the title and just start typing away.

I think it's possible.

Let me quote part of 'Creating Your Reality' by Anne Varnes.

 Let me give you an example of this amazing creative ability that each and every one of us
 <br>
 possesses. As I was perusing an art gallery during an out-of-body experience, I couldn't believe
 <br>
 the beauty and magnificence of the paintings that were before me. Someone in the gallery
 <br>
 greeted me and stated that I, too, could create paintings of this caliber should I desire. Although I
 <br>
 am a creative and artistic person, this was something far beyond any known conscious ability
 <br>
 that I knew existed on my part. I was encouraged, however, to try and manifest a painting on my
 <br>
 own. I went over to a blank palette and started to use my will to conjure up a painting. I didn't
 <br>
 focus on what it was, just let my higher creative self come through. As I watched, the most
 <br>
 beautiful piece of art started to appear. I couldn't believe that was within me. It was heavenly!
 <br>
 You see, because I had no physical filter present, the creative forces were allowed to come forth
 <br>
 without any obstruction. If I had a physical brain that was more "open," I could have created this
 <br>
 here on earth as well. Even during intense meditation here in the physical when my brainwaves
 <br>
 have passed from alpha to theta, I am able to conjure up sublime musical pieces and imagery that
 <br>
 would rival any master here on earth. It is within us all. We talk of right- and left-brain people,
 <br>
 but what this is really saying is that one side of the brain has a filter more open than the other and
 <br>
 that their gifts are making it evident which side is less restricted.

From what this is saying, you should have no problem creating your masterpieces in the astral. You can download that book here, if you want:
