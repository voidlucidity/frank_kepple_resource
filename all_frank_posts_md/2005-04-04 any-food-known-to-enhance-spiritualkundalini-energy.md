Does anyone know of any food or other substance(herbs, drugs) that assist in raising spiritual energy, or help bring about the vibration state?
<br>
I occasionally take a sleeping pill containing melatonin and valerian root, I've noticed it sometimes seems to help me get into the vibration state faster, no luck projecting yet though, and then the rest of the night I have VIVID dreams.  Anyone have any thoughts/ideas?

Eating healthy is probably your best bet. A lot of people have iron deficiency as well (especially women) and an iron deficiency can cause Restless Leg Syndrome, which can be particularly problematic in trying to OBE or reach a vibration state.
<br>
<br>
Valerian, if taken frequently, also has a chance of giving you some withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it (not serious symptoms, but you should be aware of it nonetheless). Melatonin also shouldn't be relied on too heavily, as it can alter your sleeping patterns (melatonin naturally causes sleepiness, and it is produced when it gets dark, so sometimes introducing it artificially can mess with that schedule). Most importantly, when dealing with any kind of thing like this, it's best to consult a physician.
<br>
<br>
As for raising energy, try something like Qi-Gong, Tai-Chi, Yoga, or NEW.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Fresh spinach really does it for me, and avocado. But I'm a strict vegetarian and eat mainly vegetables and a couple of staple carbohydrates (rice &amp; potatoes) though I do eat pasta or bread when I'm in the mood. So even eating bananas can put me in an altered state as I'm not used to the sweetness. Basically, anything wholesome and earthy gets me right in the mood (in more ways than one, lol).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That's interesting, because spinach is high in iron (as are bananas). Avocado provides essential fatty acids (and calories). I think a vegetarian diet (or just making sure you eat more veggies) is probably good for OBEs because of the vitamin value. I believe I've seen a trend of more success in my personal OBE practice when I have taken daily vitamins and gotten more exercise.

For the base eat healthy foods. Select fresh foods as much moderation as possible. This way you are likely to gain all essential vitamins and minerals by moderated fruit and veg. Foods effect our consciousness their fore it will effect your chance of obeing success rate. The next thing to do is when your body is removed all junk food. You will not be feeling sleepy as you might possibly do. Use this to your advantage.  After this make a fasting for a day or two. So it increases the noun physical activity during sleep. You will have to use your will against your built in physiological eating habits in order to fast the day. You may notice the next day that you are not so desperate to eat food. This is because the built in physiological habit is broken down before you eyes thank god.  Also once again another advantage and increases the scales for success. The second step is your herb intake. Herbs effect people on a genetic level. This means that each herbal-drug has a different effect on a person. Yes I know that large groups of people in a survey may experience common linked effects. Slightly differ.  Find what fits best on you. I recommend Salvia Divinorum. It's always the best choice. Reason... Because of good dissociation properties. It's good for entering trance. Leaves you in altered state of consciousness. Good for trance and obe projection practice.  Makes you feel flouting sinking sensations good stimulation combo combined with visualization of separating out of the body techniques.  This just comes to your aid if you have access to it. Their is always pot. Used by the ancients. If it was bad for you the ancients wont be smoking it. Once again find it's legal status in your country. Some people might argue about it but I don't care. Also about herbal highs. Salvia is one of the strategies. Find what works best for you.

It all depends on how weed is been used in order to achieve any obe phenomena. Some people claim that their dreams are more intense because of it. While this giving a more bigger chance of a lucidy hint which reflects on obe increase chance. The reason why you might of not remembered it is because you have bad dream recall or you haven't experienced anything that would be labelled as important after waking. The other reason might be because you might of drank lots of alcohol with MJ this causing memory loss. I can't remember it phenomena. MJ increases meditational state their fore the chances are much higher to achieve obe. The subconsciousness is well exposed this giving advantage by using affirmations. Affirmations seem to be much stronger which strengthens your obe chance. This is because the affirmations have a faster connection with the subconsciousness that making your normal affirmations a whole lot faster more effective and more stronger as I would normally say. Also in very high doses the borderline near passing out stoned state one may experience obe.  Mixing MJ together with Salvia has proven a obe formula if done properly. Really the best advantage of using MJ is basically the more easily slip in good meditation when intoxicated or the after long term effect of it when sober.

Well, I think I have good dream recall- on average 3 dreams a night.  I didnt ever really drink alchohol while smoking MJ- so thats not a factor.

Salvia may put you in a "trance" but when not mentally projected a trace is no more than an interactive video when it comes to any sort of mental activities aka its not the real thing.

Does Anyone here happen to know anything about medicine?? Or is this stuff just been picked up off the internet and regurgitated authoritatively? Because I can tell you from several personal experiences and 8 years of medical training that pot will relax you, block your pain receptors, and make you high by scrambling your brain but will produce nothing like a natural Out of body experience. and if you are "So stoned that you are about to pass out" that it may feel like an OBE, but good luck remembering that. Because guess what. . . you're gonna pass out. Salvia might help, I've tried it a couple times and got nothing but some slurred speech and a phenomenal appreciation for a sunrise I saw while driving home at 6:30 in the morning. Quite simply the best approach is to set your alarm clock for 4:30am get up, tell yourself you're going to project, and go back to bed with some headphones on and a gateway CD. 20-30 minutes later, you'll probably have a clumsy OBE.

I find that eating the pot, then soaking it down with a lot of extra hot hot sauce is an alternative to smoking it.

In terms of raising the kundalini energy.
<br>
<br>
couple tabs of good LSD is like sticking your butt in an astral energy socket. It's like kundalini electrocution. You HAVE to go into yogic poses just to withstand the energy.
<br>
<br>
But... I mean, be prepared if you do it. The first time this happened to me it took well over a month to fully recover and come to grips with all the changes it caused.
<br>
<br>
Of course though, LSD doesn't do this to everyone. But if your already versed in kundalini, some sensations of it, know the meditations and want to experience it fully. I have little doubt that LSD will be the thing that lets it all flow.
<br>
<br>
<br>
And on the subject of pot. I find that in terms of astral work. It only ever aided me when I ate it. Whenever I smoked it the effect was just too immediate, too jarring, too 'im high' to let me relax and really drift out. Eating it though. Come up nice and smooth and you can get REALLY REALLY high if you eat it without having your heart beat like crazy and be distracting. Which is a major issue with meditations and smoking weed for me, makes the heart beat to a distracting level.

I'll remember that in case I ever want a mexican-themed hashpod
<img alt=":-D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/grin.png" title="Grin"/>
(not sure how you call these in English).
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I personally don't think MJ helps meditation, and yes I have experience (I'm dutch
<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
). You will find that if you 'play' music in your head while stoned it will sound more clear then usual (same as in deep meditation). Also it is easier to produce falling sensations, if you use them to get into a trance. These are the up sides.
<br>
<br>
But there is one major problem,distraction. I cannot focus on one thought or exercise when high. Next time you smoke and go to sleep, try and analyze your thoughts. You will find that they are incredibly stupid and are really about nothing at all. And as such I don't prefer stoned meditation, I like to keep my experiences as objective as possible, and being high distracts my mind to weird and useless things.
<br>
<br>
This is all me though, but it's something to think about

As for diet, as others have said, a healthy and varied diet will keep your body healthy, this is obviously also positively affects your energy and meditations.
<br>
<br>
Then there are certain herbs and types of food that are said to be strong in one of the elements. By observing yourself you can find out if the elements are balanced (in yourself), and if not eating the herb/food associated with that specific element might help regain the balance. Besides this, I don't know.

LSD, or some shrooms...they definitely raise energy, they took me out of the matrix of society..MJ is just a party drug but i can see how it can be used for meditation for some people. Now I hear that Ayayswah or mescaline is were it's at. I heard it's definitely and altered state of reality but very powerful stuff. DMT and Salvia are just instan alter-realities, you never know where you end up on those things..alcochol, it just for good time with buddies..it just numbs energy or holds the energy for longer periods of time like when you are enjoying it with some friends in the moment. kinda like a freeze thing. sometimes i feel like my blood rises upward my body when i laugh alot..idk just me. I deffiently need to hit up that mescaline, i wonder what you see...or even feel, i heard its euphoric like crazy...forget sex all you need is a bottle of mescaline or lsd..lol

<br>
You want to raise the energy level or do you want to raise the perception?  It may not be the energy if you dream vividly after you take melatonin.  I suggest you quit taking any over-the-counter sleep aids and go strictly with melatonin.  I don't know that much about valerian root other than it is a natural root of a tree.  Well, I just saw something which may cause a small reaction.  Valerian root is a 'inverse agonist.'  You have agonist (exciter), antagonist (repeller), and inverse agonist (returner). Methodone is an partial agonist, it partially excites the opiod receptors to battle drug addiction or some other type of addiction.  In using valerian root, you cause the receptors to bind to the other receptors of melatonin.  Melatonin is made in your brain by the seratonin secreted from your pineal gland.  But, you have 3 types of melatonin in the body.
<br>
<br>
There is a something that helps your body in the area of reception of any outside energy and that is chlorophyll or copper chlorophyllum.  But nothing beats vitamin B12 during the day to improve the nerve function, memory, and energy.  All of the other sleeping drugs mimic the chemical nature of melatonin.  I believe melatonin to be the stuff used by the Mayans.
<br>
<br>
There is another thing to help with the dreams and that is nasal spray.

Tequila.
<br>
<br>
Tequila is one of those substances that produces a flurry of unconscious activity. Sometimes vividly insane and other times enormously enlightening. Last night I had a drink containing tequila, and I dreamed only of the same person being everyone I met in the dream (I've never had a dream like this before) He was the train conductor, a shop keep and my father. Then he was a spiritual man in a field...he was everyone except for this clown with a jet pack that I kept yelling at to get out of my house.
<i>
 That
</i>
guy was annoying. I kept calling him an a--hole and telling him to get out of my house, and every time I caught him he'd turn on his jet pack and fly through a closed window.

<section>
I have a vegan diet that is mostly organic. My spirit guidance has sent me messages about the importance of eating healthy in order to keep my energy balanced.
<br>
<br>
In her book Cosmic Journeys, Rosalind Mcknight wrote about how the spirits she and Robert Monroe were working with told her and Robert that they needed to eat healthier food, because the food they were eating was making it difficult for the spirits to work with them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding kundalini, I believe it is a mistake to try to rise it with energetic techniques. I've found that if one gets over the limiting thought patterns and emotional issues that limits one's energetic flow, one's kundalini will rise naturally.
<br>
<br>
Early on during my kundalini unfoldment process I was shown this sequence of symbolic images one night. First I was shown a lifesize heavy metal rocker dude. I could see kundalini flowing within him. He said: "I use kundalini for evil."  Next I was shown a lifesize demonic image of myself. Next I was shown the face of Jesus Christ. The message was clear. If I'm going to go through the kundalini unfoldment process, make certain that I do so with Christ consciousness/love in mind.
<br>
<br>
My feeling is that kundalini represents the creative aspect of being. This creative aspect of being can used any many ways. Therefore, one needs to choose wisely. Especially since things eventually reach the point where one's subconscious becomes less obscurred, and one's tendency to make contact with spirits becomes more prevalent, after one's kundalini rises. A lot of people have had problems with their awakened kundalini.

<section>
Astral counciousness is primarily caused by a change in brain chemistry,when sleeping the body produces several endogenous components,firsly melatonin,it is an evolving compound,from melatonin pinoline is created,pinoline and melatonin can replicate dna and are bodys primary means of mitosis.
<br>
They are also endogenous psychoactives.When sufficient amount of pinoline saturates the neocortex it inhibits monoamine oxidase enzyme,which normally breaks down higher visionary neurotransmitters,5-meo-dmt and dmt.When mao enzyme is inhibited and level of melatonin is high it proceeds to further evolve to 5-meo-dmt and lastly dmt (the spirit molecule) this happens to some extent when dreaming,more so when projecting or lucid dreaming.Amazonian ayahuasca brews (used as medicine) contains exact same exogenous molecules.This also happens gradually in the course of two weeks when one is deprived of light ie.dark room retreat.Using exogenous material to some extent with meditative practise is very helpful to awaken the brain to experience higher states and to stimulate it to produce its own endogenous material.I would not take shrooms or lsd,they just are not right stuff..similar but not just quite the real thing.

toxic-free diet could make you a better filter for higher information and help you progress in meditations and/or OBEs
<br>
<br>
OBE inducing drugs are certainly NOT recommended.  I have been to a consciousness development school, and from what I learned there, apparently it is possible to have OBEs using drugs but you will attract consciousnesses with similar energy ie psychotic post mortem which are spirits who have passed on with drugs addictions, and will still get a kick by attaching themselves to humans with similar interest.
<br>
<br>
Obviously it's your choice.
