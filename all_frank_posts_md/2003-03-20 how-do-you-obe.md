Look at the main web site.

<br>
There are articles by Robert Bruce. The downloads section has "treatise on OBE v. 2" or something like that. It has the rope technique.

First you need to start reading everything you can find on the topic, which will have the effect of priming yourself. Though it is perhaps best not to take everything you read too literally as, ultimately, chances are you will need to develop a routine that suits you best.
<br>
<br>
With me, for example, I've developed a fairly successful projection rundown that's been formed from about 40% Bob Monroe, 20% Robert Bruce, 10% Bruce Moen, and the remaining 30% from my own internal research.
<br>
<br>
Though no-one please get me wrong here and think these percentage figures in any way serve to indicate the relative effectiveness of the methods employed. The figures merely indicate the approximate mix I have formed, that is aligned in accordance with my particular style of understanding.
<br>
<br>
As you come across as a complete beginner, I think maybe the first step forward would be for you to try emulating the Bruce Moen Focussed Attention approach, rather than traditional obe. Reason being, people who have repeatedly tried and failed with more traditional methods (as did Mr Moen, himself) have had fairly quick successes with Focussed Attention.
<br>
<br>
Also, a number of people who set out on the Focussed attention road, have gone on to develop more traditional skills associated with the Bob Monroe and Robert Bruce schools of thought. Which I guess is only natural as, whichever way you approach it, it's basically the same phenomenon that we are dealing with.
<br>
<br>
There's a lot of useful info given on the main site as Tom kindly pointed out. You will find out about the B.Moen approach here:

Dude...go read Astral Dynamics.
<br>
<br>
There really isn't any more logic to it. Research, attempt, and attempt some more. You don't just "do it."
<br>
<br>
Again, read Astral Dynamics. This forum would be less crowded if people just did that [

Reading is unpopular. Maybe if Robert Bruce made a cartoon out of his book "Astral Dynamics" it would be more popular. Fortunately he is too busy. Part of the problem is that there are few places where people are taught to read effectively. My problem is the opposite. It is not easy to sit through a movie or tv show.

I think it all boils down to how much you really want to learn. Â I know that i will read anything to gain me a great knowledge of a subject, simply because i *want* to learn and will put the time into doing so.

<section>
I absolutely agree. I only really care about reading through a great deal of things if I really *want* to learn about a subject. I mean, how many of you would spend hours on end reading about math whereas you could learn about something you're interested in (i.e. OBE)?
<br>
<br>
Reading isn't very popular, but it must be done for the sake of knowledge. It's too true that there are not many places where you are taught to read effectively. Most people just learn to read effectively by themselves. Teaching you doesn't do much, seeing as most members of a class wouldn't care.
<br>
<br>
And about Astral Dynamics being a cartoon? Pictures may paint a thousand words but you can't explain something like OBE or NEW in a bunch of pictures...even with a little words. The 600 page book would jump to 6000 [

My remark about making a cartoon out of "Astral Dynamics" was a joke with DBZ in mind. I hope it never actually happens.
<br>
<br>
It really is not easy to write a book with everyone in mind so that anyone can pick it up and learn things like working with energy. Teaching people individually and in person is much easier. My opinion is that the two approaches should be combined and that energy work should be a class in school along with math, science, reading, grammar, etc. With the rising costs of health care, this would help by taking some strain from the system. There would be other benefits, but the ones measurable in hard currency have more weight to them.
<br>
<br>
Part of the problem I am having learning astral projection is that the strong desire to get out of body is no longer there. It seems to weaken the effectiveness of projection techniques. At least I seem to be past my tendency to fall asleep during most attempts.

Reading books is a good start. Having read a lot of books (with more still to go like Bruce Moen - thanks Frank) I would recommend the following: Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce; Out of Body Experiences by Robert Peterson; and Adventures Beyond the Body by William Bulhman. Hope this helps. [
