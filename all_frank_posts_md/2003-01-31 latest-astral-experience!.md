An interesting one from last night.
<br>
I didnt do any mental exercises or anything, I just went to bed as usual. Anyway, some time this morning I seemed to partially awake to find I was reading some AP or phasing manual (in my dream) and at the same time this voice was lecturing me on the best way to get into the astral. I'm sure this voice was my own but I can't verify that one. The voice was saying that in order to have a higher level of concious awareness when 'dreaming' I should imagine some kind of scene and fill in all kinds of detail, such as objects that are there, people, scenery and so on, but really try to make it as detailed as possible.
<br>
You mentally do this as you drop off to sleep at night. The idea is that then you will slip into this enviroment naturaly as you go to sleep. I think that the realisation you will get as you slip into this self created world will be enough to raise your awareness up so that you can take control of it, or at least be aware enough to 'lucid dream' which is the first step....
<br>
<br>
Later I fell asleep and had several 'astral cinema screen' effects, interestingly most of these were focused on people, incredably detailed close ups of people (faces esp.) but I can't be sure if I recognise them or not but they were incredably clear and could see me, although they didnt respond as such.
<br>
These would evaporate after a while.
<br>
Finally the last astral screen effect I had was of this room, a large hall and chairs were gathered round in a large circle with people sitting on them, perhaps engaged in a discussion of some sort (kind of like a very big tutorial group).
<br>
<br>
I Conciously moved forward into the 'screen' and for the first time actually entered into it, I've been trying that for ages! I walked into the mddle of the circle, but only one or two people really noticed me I think. I was fully aware all this time, which was good but I had to remain focused as it was very easy to slip back down into 'dream mode' and I was aware of this, I was continually having to focus my attention on being 'aware'.
<br>
<br>
Then, instead of sitting down in one of the spare seats I decided to fly up into the air and I done some acrobatics, at which point the the 'tutor' of the group shouted out to me to get back down and start behaving myself!
<br>
I then came down and took my place on one of the seats, and nodded at the guy sitting next to me, who seemed friendly enough.
<br>
<br>
I can't remember what the group where discussing but I soon lost interest and started to muse on the idea that some people have had on the forum about contacting deceased relatives and so on while in the astral. I imediatly thought about my uncle who died a few years ago who I got on really well with, so I put out a thought to see if he was around.
<br>
Well, imediately from a doorway to the right he appeared, just as I remembered him, he smiled and I ran over and hugged him and asked how he was. It was only as I began questioning him that I realised that something wasnt quite right.
<br>
<br>
My uncle was very realistic and responded quite well but seemed very vague and incoherrent in his replies and it dawned on me that he was a 'thought form' rather than my uncle proper. I still held out for a while because I remember RB talking about this and suggesting that thought forms are still useful to create if you want to contact deceased relatives because sometimes the real person might come along and inhabit the shell you have created, thus allowing contact to take place. Nothing of that nature seemed to happen here however.
<br>
<br>
Well that's it.. From the amount I typed I see that quite a lot happened last night actually.
<br>
Good progress this time: for the first time I have stepped into an 'astral screen', but I'm not sure how the 'advice' I recieved first fits into this or if it is actually useful or not!
<br>
<br>
All for now,
<br>

I aggree with your message. Albeit I have only managed to have a concious projection once before, I have had a couple of near exits. Both these near exits the method I used was to imagine walking around my flat, the sights, sounds, textures and smells of it all. As detailed as possible. I believe that this approach makes your mind question whether you are laying down in bed for example or walking around somewhere else. I stress that its probably better if its a familiar place like a home or workplace.

I think that what's most interesting is that most of my progress so far has been when I have *not* been trying. It's always when I have a break that something happens!

This is "sleep school" where you can often catch yourself reading something that a guide has given you or hearing someone lecture you about a topic.

This sounds like sleep-school again only taken one step futher.

Yes, it's great when that first happens. You take a mental step forward and suddenly find yourself immersed in whatever you were viewing a moment previously. The concentration aspect gets easier the more you project. You need to try and make every action and every thought, very slow and determined. Otherwise events will have a tendency to just become a kind of whirl and off you'll pop to sleep.

Here you need to be a tad careful when getting into this kind of situation. Always bear in mind that you are within an environment where Though = Direct Action.

It may have been the case that when your uncle came about a tinge of Doubt crossed your mind as to whether or not it was truly him. Problem is, any release of Doubt causes reality fluctuations that serve to justify whatever degree of Doubt you are releasing. I'm not saying that was necessarily the case, and you may be absolutely right in what you say. But you need to always be on your guard when you are within the Astral environment.
<br>
<br>
The basic ground-rule is: Thought = Direct Action. Which also means your ability to perceive is directly proportional to your willingness to believe. Which, I'm sure you can see, makes for a bit of a tricky mix.
<br>
<br>
Overall, it sounds like you made a big step forward. All you have to do now is the same again.
