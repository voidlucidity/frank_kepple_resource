A friend who's astral travelled all her life typed this up about her experience in a place which seemed very low astral and where she got attacked - and how she got herself sorted out.

Yes, that's pretty much how it is. All very disgusting stuff by Physical world standards, but par for the course on the lower planes.
<br>
<br>
All that happened is the poster let herself be carried away by it all. The heading claims she's been an Astral traveller all her life. Well, she's either very young or a mighty slow learner.

<br>
<br>
If she'd simply increased the level of her radiation nothing would have happened. Maybe she could have rescued one or two, instead of turning into emotional jelly. Problem is, these kinds of posts tend to scare newcomers sh*tless. The implication being, "Gosh, if someone who has travelled all their lives is experiencing this sort of hellish experience, what chance do I stand as a complete beginner?"
<br>
<br>
The poster suggested a solution about getting in touch with gods and chanting, etc. Which I don't buy, personally. The simple and most straightforward thing is to ask a guide to take you around.
<br>
<br>
I used to tour the lower planes with a regular guide. It was when I was going through a phase of learning how to remain emotionally closed. It's quite simple to do once you get the knack of it. Then you just maintain an air of mild curiosity.
<br>
<br>
For anyone who may want to try and rescue these people, all you need do is: when they approach in a manner which suggests you'll be their next victim, simply radiate a strong mix of compassion and understanding. Which makes
<i>
 them
</i>
turn to jelly, not you.

It's true that these horror-articels will get people paranoid and frightened; but then again it's good to know what may happen to you and how to get out of there ... it's a 'golden mean' thing, I think.

Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.

Ive never been to a place like that.But ive been in some hairy situations.All you gotta do is think about your physical body.Its that easy.But if for some reason you cant leave,.Id take Franks advice.
<br>
<br>
Id just be careful not to project from a negative environment.She mentioned she was staying at a relatives.And there  was some drinking and nasty energy currents in the air.
<br>
<br>
I dont see how she would end up there otherwise.

<section>
if you do project to an unpleasant environment, is there any way you can make it pleasant? when you get there if you generate sincere love and compassion for those beings and the environment, is it possible to change it or help them?
<br>
<br>
i dont worry about the dweller but there are times right at the time that projection is supposed to occur that i think about what i would do if the dweller was there. i believe i would be sympathetic and kind to him and maybe ask him to help me out or something.

I was asking her more about it and she said that even though she and others had quite a few drinks that day, she's had a few strange and unpleasant things happen in that holiday spot.  Bad energy there, she thinks.
<br>
<br>
Frank - Very young or a mighty slow learner?  I don't know if I buy that.  If everyone worked from Robert's works things would maybe be easier but she's been a natural on and off since she was a kid and I don't think anything could prepare her for the shock of just suddenly ending up there ostensibly through no fault of her own.  Maybe like walking though town hundreds of times and then getting mugged.
<br>
<br>
I'll mention radiating compassion and understanding and see if she's ever tried that.  (Personally I don't know if I'd have the balls in such a situation!)  For the record, I think her friend who rescued her projected Golden Light energy or something like that, which is his regular thing and I imagine is fairly disruptive in a murky area like that.
<br>
<br>
I see the point about scaring new projectors away, but I know of two guys who were "naturals" as kids and lost the knack, then learned it later as adults.  Problem is that they both had scary experiences - one was just tormented a little with his bedsheets trying to strangle him as he was separating (which he perservered though so that was ok), but the other guy was set upon while flying about and the experience was so incredibly upsetting for him that he even took self-hypnosis to make sure he never ever projected again.  No kidding.
<br>
<br>
So my point is that even when you haven't ostensibly done anything wrong, bad things can happen.  True, it might worry people, but Robert's chapter on scary things that can happen scared the pants off me!  But it's good to be preapred.  Hopefully then people will take more precautions and be more mindful of how to look after themselves.  If you live in LA you warn your kids about the bad neighbourhoods and how to avoid getting mugged right?
<br>
<br>
More knowledge sharing has got to be a good thing - if in balance of course.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

The mistake is in thinking something is unpleasant, or pleasant.
<br>
<br>
That kind of thinking is Physical-world reality only. It's like when I project to the Astral and *still* think in terms of up; down; left; right. Call me dumb but, for some reason, I'm having a lot of difficulty getting such thinking out of my system. Which is why, I am told, by the immensly perservering souls who guide me, I'm having major Astral-navigation difficulties.
<br>
<br>
The correct emotional state to maintain, on the Astral, is to simply remain neutral. Though I have found it more productive to maintain an air of mild curiosity. Which, strictly speaking, is not a perfectly neutral state.
<br>
<br>
The key to remaining neutral is to recognise and *totally* accept that the lower-level situation that is being perceived is not real in the Physical sense. Problem is, though, these situations can (and very often do) look ever so real in exactly the way they would look in Physical-matter reality.
<br>
<br>
The woman says she was terrified as the people threatened to throw her on the bonfire. So what? What possible harm could that do? To my mind, this kind of thinking serves as a prime example of base-level Astral anthropormorphism.
<br>
<br>
The only person who can harm you, on the Astral, is yourself (as you believe, so it becomes in glorious 3D Technicolour).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Several years ago I dreamed that I was in a hell of some sort. I was inspired to use a combination of mantras. It was a magnificent experience. I chanted the mantra as loud as possible and demonstrated walking unharmed through fire. The others took up the chanting and we destroyed the hell we were in. I was shocked that no one heard me when I woke up, with all the shouting. I was living in a college dormitory.

Actually I just asked the chap who rescued her exactly what he did and how he got her out of there and he said:
<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">
 Golden Light of course, and just being there provides
 <br>
 an orientational frequency reference for the person
 <br>
 who has become lost.
 <br>
 <br>
 Change the frequency the lost one is holding by
 <br>
 sharing via resonance and they shift through the
 <br>
 sub-realms.  It's kinda like getting a jump-start.
 <br>
 <br>
 Those lower astral beings lock people in their realm
 <br>
 by lowering and fixing frequency. If one aligns with
 <br>
 the Light, then the frequency is shifted to higher
 <br>
 rate of vibration.
 <br>
</font>
<br>
<br>
I really don't quite know where he found out all about that stuff but he has done lots of work originally with the Golden Dawn (which his totally disavows these days) and the BOTA (Builders Of The Adytum) and that's where his astral travels and later clairvoyant perceptions started happening.
<br>
<br>
All pretty interesting stuff.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
