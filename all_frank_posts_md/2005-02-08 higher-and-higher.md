 It did make me cranky this morning having to go to work...

It's so true. It's times like those where I wonder if it's worth it.
<br>
<br>
Great experience.

 It can get drudgerous at times...real life that is, but I was more or less expressing some normal grumpiness with coming down from a high.

<br>
Oh, that's what I meant! It's times like those when I wonder whether dream/AP study is worth it. I mean, you get this extreme high, fantastic experience of otherworldly phenomena, and then you wake up. Does the real world change? No. You still have to go to work. Moreover, will people at work care that you had such an experience. Most likely not, as few people are able to relate.
<br>
<br>
But that thought of regret doesn't last very long, of course. How can you forget such an experience? You just can't!
<br>
<br>
Sorry, MT, I didn't express myself clearly enough. I try to go for short, simple posts in order to not sound confusing... but it tends to have to opposite effect.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, I thank you for worrying about me (again).

You care for other forum members just the same, and that thought is comforting.

You're right, of course.
<br>
<br>
But wouldn't it be nice to share it with people, and converse with them as though it were commonly real? You can do that with singing birds, but you can't do that with dreams. To your friends and coworkers, your dreams aren't actually real them. They're only real in the sense that they see you describing them. In my case, when I read your post, I kind of created my own little dream on the side, based on your description and my past experiences, and I can relate to how it must've felt. But that's about all I can do - create my own little dream.
<br>
<br>
If you had seen a good movie, you would tell your friends to go to see it. After they saw it, you would have a common reference. If you had heard a good song, you would play for them, and you would enjoy a common theme. If a funny thing happened to you on the way to work, you can't rewind time and show it for people, but everyone who knows what path you take to work will be able to build an image from a common base.
<br>
<br>
Dream worlds and physical worlds are both complimentarily beautiful. But they lack a social connection, don't they?

With respect to MajorTom for an excellent post that has stimulated some great points, Telos, you indulge in some interesting concepts and you have a depth of thought that is most unusual for someone of your age (conventionally speaking).
<br>
<br>
It has always fascinated me, the thought of being able to bring my knowledge of the inner words to the forefront of my physical existence. Ultimately, I learnt that it is a question of thinking beyond limitations. It's about recognising that limitations are what we place before ourselves for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
You hit on a good point: and then you wake up, and it's the same old place... but is it? We are in a linear time framework, remember, change takes "time". You have to break the big changes down into tiny chunks that people can chew upon. Otherwise, you get into situations where you are just broadcasting rather than
<i>
 communicating
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
MajorTom is older (in terms of linear time) so he has already learnt about situations such as you cannot be in one world at the expense of another. And how very true that is.
<br>
<br>
That's a *very* valuable lesson that is being presented to you on a plate, as it were. We're not talking "fictional worlds" here, this is not escapism, this is reality. But true reality, reality in wider sense. Not the limited focus on reality most people engage in. You, Telos, are on the brink of that. You are sitting there, kinda half in and half out. I admire your courage.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank, thank you for your thoughts and kind words. Your insight is highly valued, as is MajorTom's.
<br>
<br>
I've been meditating on ways to "think beyond limitations," which is not unlike, "thinking as if dreaming," and can be useful for consciously entering a dream state. But that is easier said than done.
<br>
<br>
I'll report back once I have something substantial. Thanks again to the both of you, and I look forward to reading your future posts.
