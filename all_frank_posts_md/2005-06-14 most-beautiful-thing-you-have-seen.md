Just out of curiosity, what is the most beautiful or amazing thing you have witnessed in the ATZ, mainly, or in the astral as well. Also, what are some things that you have seen that completely put you in awe/shock when you witnessed it. Also, what are some beautiful things you have seen in space (outside of earth) if you have left earth, like going into the center of the sun, witnessing unknown galaxies up close, Saturn's rings, or something like that. Oh yeah, I also wanted to ask if anyone has communicated with extraterrestrials (beings that are alive in the physical dimension)  in the ATZ at all, or talked with any in the astral, and if so, what did they say, or think about you, etc.
<br>
<br>
I just thought that this would be an interesting topic, and if any of you have experience or stories/ encounters with any of this, please share! I would love to know about some of this stuff!
<br>
<br>
iThank you!

Hi:
<br>
<br>
I have seen many, many beautiful things. But the most beautiful thing, to me, was when I saw my future relationship unfold before my very eyes. It was unbelievable even though I had been "astral projecting" for years and years, it was simply unreal. I guess nothing can prepare you for those times.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
Yes, I first saw her as a connection to my Primary Essence within Focus 4 of consciousness. I called her my One and named her Biscuit. Not literally a biscuit, but that is how the subjective energy translated into an objective sense. About 8 months ago she walked right into my life. I knew right away it was her, she had been coming into my dreams for a while.
<br>
<br>
I went through a little denial phase at first not believing and all that. Only natural I suppose, even for me. The way these subjective energies can immediately translate into actual physical reality does still bowl me over with something so profound and as personal as this.
<br>
<br>
The smaller stuff I have gotten used to now. To the extent where I have lost count of the number of times I have dreamt something and the exact scene has been played out within physical reality. Sometimes I know what is going to happen that day by the dreams I have had the previous night.
<br>
<br>
Now I just need to start dreaming about the lottery. :)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Do you call her "biscuit" as a pet name?  I once had a girlfriend I nicknamed "my little tater tot" because it made her so embarrassed when I would say it in public.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, you should write a chapter in your Astral projecting book about finding a soul mate.  I'm sure all these lonely women on this board would gobble it up.

{Frank, I read you post below this and I just want you to know that I wasn't making fun of this concept-just that a lot of people are looking for their soul mates these days}  {btw, I am not ready to find mine yet- but would love to in the future}
<br>
<br>
Have you told her about your AP skill?  Does she think you nuts

When you dreamt about her, did you saw her face? did it matched the real face of that friend?
<br>
<br>
I really must work more on AP, see if i can find a decent girl for me

<br>
<br>
btw, i know a man (real story, and the man its not mystic and he is a very serious person) that dreamt about the numbers of the lottery (here in Portugal we have a lottery with numbers. If you guess th 7 numbers you win. The numbers goes from 1 to 49).
<br>
<br>
When he wake up he couldnt remember the last number. He played in the lottery with 6 numbers and he won! he guessed all the 6 numbers less the seventh (it was enough for a good reward like...maybe 400 dollars. i dint know...the 7 numbers its a huge amount).
<br>
<br>
When i saw the last number that i couldnt remember he saw that it was that the missing number indeed. So, in his dream he guessed all the numbers!!
<br>
<br>
Honestly, i would prefer to see/change other things in my future, others than lottery and money..really. There are more important things than that in my life. Well, but if i dream with lottery..i will be very happy

I only saw her mouth, there was just something about that mouth. The top lip, the angle of the front teeth. The cute smile. It was a bit like Cinderella and trying to find the foot that fit the shoe. Well, with me it was the mouth. I doubted it for a while. But when I saw a picture of her face then I knew it was her. I had seen that mouth so many times in my dreams.

We often talk about the wider reality as she is kinda into it funnily enough. Not to the same extent as I but she is coming along very well and is very receptive to taking on new concepts.
<br>
<br>
I do believe in the concept of "soul mate" and would like to present my thoughts on the matter in the book. If my experiences in this regard will help others then I will do my utmost to give pointers where possible. This side of life is very important to all of us and the religious "marriage" constructs are letting us down badly.
<br>
<br>
I strongly feel that it is time we moved to the next level, so to speak, in all things. Even in our thinking as regards our relationships. I see you are a bit of a pioneer in that regard and I congratulate you for your courage in speaking outside of the "norm" as it were. I hope that one day you too will meet your One.

<br>
Well, marriage is a nice idea, don't get me wrong. But the fact is that most marriages now end in divorce (where divorce is recognised and available). So in that sense they are not fulfilling the needs of the people in question. I believe that people should try to seek out those we would call our "soul mates", as an end goal, as it were, but at the same time have a lot of fun. I dearly would like to see even more freedoms in terms of women's rights in society. I firmly believe that women should hold their rightful place in society, as equals, with men.
<br>
<br>
I fail to see what right the government has to interfere with our personal relationships. If I wish to marry two or more women then that is my personal business. I resent the fact that some Nanny government sees fit to tell me what I can or cannot do in the privacy of my bedroom, or sees fit to tell me where I can choose to stick my penis. My penis and my erection is my private affair. What I choose to do with my body should be my business, and no-one else's, but certainly not the business of a government. To suggest such is blatant oppression. But as most of us live under such oppressive regimes, we tend to consider it normal. I think the word they use, in the main, is "democracy" or
<i>
 tyranny of the majority
</i>
as the more enlightened observers would suggest.
<br>
<br>
Frankly, I think the state should just BUTT-OUT, let us get on with exploring our sexuality and just leave us be.
<br>
<br>
I do not recognise the concept of "gay" or "lesbian". They are merely people exploring their sexuality. The labels are just mass-media hype that governments use as an excuse to oppress various sectors in society for their own ends. Labels such as "gay", "lesbian", "terrorist" they are all sheep-dog terms to get the herd moving in the same direction. Hopefully, one day we will all recognise that.
<br>
<br>
In times when we have in the past, we have revolted in terms of social unrest, in terms of violence. But I am dearly looking forward to the day when we all turn around and laugh.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Synchronicity... a couple of weeks ago I decided to try to see the winning lottery numbers during LD/OBE.  Within a couple of days I had the LD/OBE and got the numbers.  So when I woke up I wrote them down and put a £1 punt on the National Lottery.  After the lottery I checked the numbers and discovered i had missed by miles.... however I had instead guessed 4 out of 5 of the numbers on the Euromillions Lottery.... it seems we have three lotteries and I punted on the wrong one.....

Oh also recently whilst OBE I was seeing how high I could fly and watching the little buildings below get smaller and smaller.  As I did this I began to noticy the atmosphere becoming darker and thinner and within a few seconds I could see the circle of the Earth beneath me in blue and green, with all of the continents... Europe Africa Asia etc clearly in view.  It was quite spectacular...

Ha ha, yes, it is not a question of merely guessing the lottery numbers, it is WHICH lottery numbers. That Euromillions lottery is so tempting. I might have a dream and enter. If you suddenly find Europe being replanted with trees, then you know Frank won... I love trees. You can buy a LOT of trees with fifty million Euro.

At the moment I only have my eyes on one woman in particular. But I do believe that women or men should be able to marry whoever they like and however they like. It is my firm belief that the state has no right to impose laws upon us that restrict us under threat of imprisonment from firmly obliging ourselves to one person only and strictly of the other gender. It is archaic, a product of Dark Age religious conditioning and the sooner it is thrown on the scrap heap the better in my view.
<br>
<br>
If a person wishes to adopt a particular religion, fair enough, that is the choice of the individual in question. I do not agree with religion but I respect individual choice. But these people have no right imposing their religious conditioning and/or beliefs upon others.

agree with you. Religion still impose its belief to people, specially in close minded countrys like mine. If  you are a gay (luckly i am not or i would be in trouble) you should think in moving to another country.

changing the topic:  i insist that i should have an harem just for me...anyone interested on joying it?

This is difficult, because I'm ready to say that the experience of lucid dreaming itself is beautiful. However, if I were say from a purely aesthetic standpoint, it would be in that lucid dream I had when I held a Dreamcast in my hand and on a projection screen in front of me lauched a display of art and beauty that I am not sure can be replicated with present-day technology. Very surreal, lifelike anime and 3D cell shading... but that is a contradiction in terms. Those genres as they exist today are not lifelike at all. They're toy-like.

<br>
Sure. I've definitely had dreams where I do random checks to see if I am dreaming, and I start getting the "intuition" that I am indeed dreaming, yet everything seems so real. Truthfully, in those instances, everything is solid and unchanging, even painful (I'd hit my hand against a wall to see what would happen). However, these "solid" experiences do not last longer than about a minute. I have not yet had a desire to prolong them further. [Edit: It's also worth noting that these types of experiences have only occured in extremely familiar settings, like my home or a store.]

<br>
There's something about trying to achieve a realistic experience of being in space without astronaut training and a  pressure suit that is very unnerving. I have always been interested in space, don't get me wrong, but when I've done it in dreams, the reality that all the facts create is unremarkable. Space is an absurdly intense desert, void of heat, sound, life, and everything except gravity itself, which comes at you from the direction of a ridiculously distant ground. It's a barren wasteland.
<br>
<br>
Truly, it's only interesting from the perspective of the Earth, in a frail human body, and with the rigorous limits of science. All those factors take attention away from the idea that it is an unforgiving abyss.
<br>
<br>
Not to discourage you, I just wonder about the nature of people's allure to astral projecting into space. Why does it seem so appealing? Without thinking about it, you're probably desiring to be someplace else.

<br>
Not so much space as things in space. For instance, I remember seeing the photos of Jupiter from the probe and thinking, that would be so intense to see. Partly it would be so intense because of the distance and the size of the planet ... I think you're completely right about space being utterly barren ... but the constellations and planets and clouds is more what I'm thinking of. Seeing that all from a distance, and then exploring.
