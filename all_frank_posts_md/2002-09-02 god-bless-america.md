  I'm sure you're all aware of the fact that September 11th is again creeping up on us. And I was wondering where people were when they first heard the news. I was a senior in high school last year, and my first period was my English class. I walked into the usually noisy busy classroom, and it was perfectly quiet. At this point, only the first tower had been hit. We sat and watched all period as the second tower, then the Pentagon were hit, and then as the towers began collapsing. It was a memorable day.

It was a very memorable day for me, even though I live here in Austria, Europe.
<br>
I had been on a little hike in the woods, and comig back I saw the news on CNN ... tragic, that.
<br>
It's just one of those things where everybody remembers what he/she was doing at the time, like the moon-landing, the kennedy-assassination, or (to a lesser extent) the death of Princess Di.
<br>
It's really sad that it's mostly negative stuff that just impresses itself on your mind and soul and keeps lingering there ...
<br>
I feel for the victims, and for the families of the victims, even though I am against the US bashing other countries for any reason, and tend to think of such occurences as 'excrement happens!'
<br>
memorable day ....
