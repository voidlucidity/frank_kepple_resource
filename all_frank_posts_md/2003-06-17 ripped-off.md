i don't know who dr who is, but the monroe institute's been researching bineural (sp?) sounds for years and years.. even if they did get the idea from someone else, they've really expanded on it.

Which Dr Who are you talking about?
<br>
I think there were like 12 of them weren't there?
<br>
How do you know they didn't steal the sounds from K9?

Am I right in thinking that the Tardis was an old British Police phone box, with a blue light on top ??!
<br>
<br>
There are still a few of these around Edinburgh in Scotland, but they've been padlocked since the advent of radio/mobile communication (and perhaps to prevent them being used as toilets by us drunk Scotsmen...).
<br>
<br>
Was there really 12 doctors ? I remember about 6 or so during the 80's when i was a youngster.

Well, FWIW, I remember the original.
<br>
<br>
Watched it avidly for years. Not so much for Dr Who, but couldn't help keep getting the hots for his female companions.

Anyway what i meant was that dr who is like someone who does not need to use his mind to tarvel in time cos he has the tardis and the darleks are like negs who try to stop him finding stuff! and the sound of the tardis helps him travel to other dimensions so he was the 1st to develop that technique
