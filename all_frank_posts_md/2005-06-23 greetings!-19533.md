Hi,
<br>
<br>
I just joined the forum a couple of days ago, and am enjoying it and learning a lot.  I'm new to astral projection, though I was interested in it when I was a teenager.  Just recently though have I begun to have real experiences.  I've unknowingly been phasing while asleep.
<br>
<br>
Other stuff about me: I'm 28, a cataloging and acquisitions librarian at a university, an aspiring novelist, and lover of anime and video games!  I also like to study foreign languages--currently trying to brush up Latin and French, while trying to pick up Japanese and Irish.  I'm nothing if not ambitious!
<br>
<br>
I recently suffered the death of my 25-year-old fiance.  Hence, "Almost Mrs. Murphy".  You'll probably hear a lot about him.  He's the main reason I want to practice astral projection.  I've already had some astral encounters with him, and it has made life much more bearable!
<br>
<br>
I'm also Catholic.  And proud to join the many Saints who seem to have had astral experiences!  Not that I consider myself a Saint, of course.  I did see Heaven last night with my fiance though.  Literally!
<br>
<br>
I look forward to learning more and exchanging experiences!

Thanks, Major Tom!  My astral experiences have brought me much happiness and comfort.  I was thinking that perhaps we could have an astral wedding!  That would be great!

I look forward to more adventures!  And you all have been a terrific help!

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting your introduction!
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
You're certainly in the right place to discuss all manner of nonphysical reality. I'm happy to read that you're still connecting with your fiance after his transition.
<br>
<br>
Welcome, and we'll look forward to sharing experiences with you.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,
<br>
Nick
