<br>
For those of you who are not yet familiar with Silver Birch, here is what Victor Zammit, the author of the Afterlife e-book says:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "Silver Birch and White Eagle are very highly spiritually evolved 'intelligences' from the afterlife. They are eye-witnesses to what is happening in the afterlife dimension that we all are destined to go. Their teachings are impeccable, highly inspirational, critically and immediately relevant to every man, woman child on this planet earth.
 <br>
 <br>
 Although there are great spiritual works transmitted from the afterlife dimension, I regard the works of these two great afterlife intelligences as the greatest spiritual works of all time in the history of psychic and spiritual phenomena."
 <br>

 Victor Zammit's exceptional 225 page Afterlife e-book is available for free download from here:

I tend to be a little wary of people who use the term "After-Life" because it seems to show what thier view of Life is. There is no such thing as an "After-Life", only 'Life' at different levels of Being.
<br>
Death is an illusion. Those that don't realize this, use the term "After-Life" as though Life somehow ends when one leaves the Physical. This may seem like i am being petty but someone who uses this term has little to teach me.
<br>
Caveat Emptor.
<br>
<br>
This reminded me of a short dialogue i had once with a character in one of my dreams;
<br>
<br>
Dream Character- "You do realize you are dead don't you?"
<br>
<br>
Me: "What is the difference?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Having said this i will try to read some of the material when i can

<section>
OK well i read some of the material and have a few things i want to comment on;
<br>
<br>
1. Any spirit that refers to "The Great Spirit" has having a gender (i.e. He, HIs Him.) is not very evolved IMO.
<br>
<br>
2. I dont like the way this "spirit" calls the medium it speaks through as "my instrument".
<br>
<br>
3. A lot of  questions put to it are not answered directly and it seems to dodge the question like a politician. Let me give one example;
<br>
<br>
Q:  "Was the body of Jesus crucified?"
<br>
<br>
A: It does not matter. What matters is what Jesus taught. You will go on arguing forever about what happened at the crucifixion.
<br>
I cannot prove what I say about that, and so I will not attempt to answer your question. I do not like to condemn others. That is not my mission.
<br>
etc etc
<br>
---------------------
<br>
<br>
No real answer there. Why couldnt it just say the truth (if it actually knows it)? I see nothing wrong in Truths, but Silver Birch seems to.
<br>
<br>
This spirit says its mission is to share spiritual knowledge that has been lost for centuries, yet from what i have read it has shared nothing new at all. I cant find one piece of knowledge that i have not heard before. I will keep reading. Sorry for my skepticism but life experiences have taught me to "test my spirits" carefully. Just because a Being exists on a dimension other than the physical doesnt automatically mean it is Enlightened.
<br>
<br>
If you disagree with anything i have said above then please provide a teaching by Silver Birch that is not already known, or something it has said you believe to be profound. I will be glad to take a look.
<br>

<br>
<br>
There is a tendency within me to agree.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, on the Physical, so many commercial factors come into play. I have a lot of marketing experience and it happens *so often* that some company, or other, produces a "give away".
<br>
<br>
In the business it's called a, "Loss Leader".
<br>
<br>
A Loss Leader is precisely designed to get people hooked. Also, because it is give-away, the wording can so easily be exaggerated. This is due to the fact consumer-protection legislation is generally geared to protecting people who send money for goods and/or services... not who receive them for free.
<br>
<br>
Once people are hooked then, "one recommends the other" and the big money is made on what is called: back-end response.
<br>

I have read a few of the articles and I am enjoying them. I do not think everyone should be so critical of them. You should question them, but do not let that hurt your ability to read it and take any lessons from it that will be good and useful. This spirit even admits that it is not perfect and that what it is saying is just things that it has learned. So take these things as you would from any of us here that are just posting. I do agree though that this spirit does not seem to be very enlightened. A few times I am wondering how true what is said is and how much is just its beliefs. An example is in one of the articles some one asked another spirit how guides come to certain people and it answers that it does not know because it never really thought about it. Then Silver Birch answers that guides are assigned by a higher being. If this was true I would think that the other spirit would know if someone told it to do something or not. So I wonder if Silver Birch did not just make an assumption about what happens. If so what else has it made an assumption about. Also many times Silver Birch quotes the Christain bible. Though it does refer to it as your bible and not The Bible, I am wondering if this spirit is influenced by Christain beliefs or if it is just using the quotes because it knows those present will understand them.
<br>
<br>
I will continue reading the articles, but I will not take them as absolute truth. I take no writings as absolute truth. But this does not mean these writings do not hold some lessons and insight.

<section>
I have read all of the articles and am very impressed with the insights that were shared by Silver Birch. I take nothing at 100% face value either, but he seemed quite sincere. You have to remember that the last incarnation of him was a Native American, but he wouldn't mention who he was before that. Also he mentions that a lot of the information is to the best of his knowlage, not absolute fact. He was also learning to communicate with us, and I'm sure our language limits him severely. I feel that the few important messages he provided such as "service is the coin of the spirit" and from the bible "love thy neighbor as you love yourself" are the most important things human beings, as a whole, need to do to better this world, and make it easier on ourselves in the next. I think that many times throughout the articles the scientists/sitters were getting caught up and confused in semantics.

<section>
Silver Birch says "love your neighbour as you love yourself", but we already know this dont we? This teaching didnt actually come from Jesus originally, it is in Leviticus, but Silver Birch didnt seem to know this.
<br>
Surely if this spirit was genuine it would have something original to tell us?
<br>
I think it only quotes from the Bible (which it suspiciously calls "your bible") when it suits it. In its teaching on Religion it has this to say;
<br>
<br>
"If you find there are some people who have all the benefits of communication with our world, but still adhere to certain conventional theological beliefs, then be sorry for them. Say a silent prayer for them because they are still only on the first rungs on the ladder or are in the half-way stage."
<br>
<br>
This got me suspicious straight away. "certain conventional theological beliefs"? And just what might they be that it is hinting at are somehow wrong? It doesnt say. What kind of positive message is that to talk about 2 billion peoples beliefs and treat them as though they all need praying for? It is basicaly saying that you should believe what IT says and not Christianity, Islam etc.
<br>
Of course, i'm sure this might appeal to those who dont feel Christianity has enough to offer, these are the people it is targeting. Good marketing in a way though. It uses the teachings of Jesus to attract people, then on the other hand attacks Christianity.
<br>

"Many words does not a Wise Man make, nor a Truth reveal."
<br>
<br>
in my opinion, this guy is just hooking millions of people into his crap by making them think he is something he isn't. it is a natural tendancy for people to believe things that are easy to believe; even more so when that belief is in some way supposed to be beneficial for them.
<br>
<br>
i have only read a few paragraphs of his "teaching" and i can tell you that i can talk far more elequently (spelling?) and manipulate people with greater ability and subtlety than that, if i so choose.
<br>
<br>
i apologize if i offend any of you with my strong words here, but i don't like scam artists who leech on truths and who divert that truth just enough that it makes them into some sort of idol. i may read more if i feel that i should, but i doubt my opinion will change to thinking any more highly of him.

<section>
Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much indeed for your comments so far.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to say that these articles that are extracts from the teachings of Silver Birch, are presented as they were at the time, and of course are only a fraction of the material that Silver Birch presented over many years.
<br>
<br>
The reason the Silver Birch articles appear on The Astral Pulse, is simply in keeping with our constant mission to offer as much material as we possibly can, on
<b>
 all
</b>
of the subjects that we encompass here - which are many and diverse - it is ultimately for each and every single person to decide on the relevance of this information to themselves as individuals, and in the context of their own progression.
<br>
<br>
These particular articles and discussions are presented in the context of this "Spiritual Development" forum, and which exists to discuss these things.
<br>
<br>
It is to be expected that there will be a diverse range of views on these Spiritual works, the same applies for just about every other subject presented on all of these forums.  All anyone can do is to make the information available, and the rest is up to the people who read it.
<br>
<br>
I would just like to make one final observation - the expression "Afterlife" might possibly be more aptly quoted as "after physical life", but there is an assumption that this might already be understood and accepted in the context of the people reading these works, who, after all, are doing so from this material, physical plane of existence.
<br>
<br>
Please keep these discussions ongoing, everyone's opinion is equally respected here.
<br>
<br>
With kindest regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Dear Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Just want to thank you for providing us with such an excellent link. I am delighted that you have brought this site  to the attention of those of us on Astral Pulse to like his work.
<br>
<br>
I feel that Silver Birch's teaching are  quite pure and even though they were channelled a long time ago, I feel they  still have much relevance.
<br>
<br>
So thank you, thank you

<section>
Thank you also Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Enjoyed Silver Birch immensely, our use of language and correctness of terms, is a conditioning, which we are used to.  Being petty as one described , in this forum, is a very useful way to object to some truth, which on the larger scale is a means also.
<br>
<br>
To me, just living in a physical body proves that i am on a spiritual journey, again a term only.
<br>
<br>
And maybe we are here, in preparation to leave.
<br>
<br>
Death is a physical certainty.

If only one could start a death fund, you know, similiar to a superannuation fund

I agree on the scepticism towards channelled info, similar to what Robert himself wrote in one of his articles.  There's always good stuff in these things like this or say Walsch's "Conversations with God" - which I regard much more as "Conversations with Walsch" - but I don't believe that they are necessarily any more informed than a speech put out by any being, physical or not.
<br>
<br>
In fact I would way rather hear from an accomplished and recognised non-commercial mystic (ie the opposite of, say, James van Praagh) with some sort of track record, rather than any channelled being who I don't know from a bar of soap.  There's just too much to read out there already and one has to pick and choose what one has time to read.
<br>
<br>
BTW a good compact read along mystical lines I stumbled across recently was the online book "The Immortal" by the excellent spiritual writer, JJ Dewey.  Not 100% sure if the story is true or not, but it is really something!  I got some good crown chakra activation going while I was reading it, and I do recommend it, though of course your mileage may vary.
