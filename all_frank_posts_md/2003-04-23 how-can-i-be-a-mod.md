Could you please give a definition for the word Mod in this context? Somehow I don't think you are talking about integer division and remainders.

I'd start by hitting the 10 post mark. Maybe even hang out here for a while.
<br>
<br>
There might be tryouts though.  That would be kinda cool.. to be shown a series of posts.. decide which are offensive.. have prizes and whatnot.

Oh ... Moderator.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
Got it now. So far no one has invited me to be a moderator, so it must not be based on just the total number of posts.

Are you interested in becoming one Tom?  Something tells me people expressed an interest and maybe RB made them one.
<br>
<br>
Im sure no one would object to you becoming one.  You're always reasonable from what ive seen.

No way would I want to be a moderator. They don't seem to be particularly active here, but it is still better to be a customer than an employee. Besides, accepting a moderator position would be a commitment to stick around. I have been thinking about going away since I hit the 800 post mark.

Becoming a Multidimensional Omnipotent Dude, for most people, takes several years of dedicated effort.

!! I imagine its hard work, Frank ! hee hee...
<br>
<br>
Though I'd suggest that if you want to become a Mod, just get hold of a few early paul weller albums and a silly scooter, and wear some tight trousers. It doesn't take the "several years of dedicated effort" Frank mentioned !
<br>
<br>
cheers
