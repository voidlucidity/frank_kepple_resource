Hi:
<br>
<br>
You might like to know that I am currently writing a book on this exact topic which will answer all your questions. I was hoping to publish it end March, but I'll need a little longer as I've been delayed by another situation.
<br>
<br>
For now I would suggest you make good use of the Search function. I doubt you'll find any other websites on this topic as we coined the term a couple of years ago. It is based on Monroe's comments in his later work, where he said that it became for him not like he was "projecting" but like he was "switching phase" from physical to astral. I had done a *lot* of research on this and it formed the basis of my own work that I began publishing on this forum 3 years ago. People wanted to know what the technique was called and we didn't have a name for it. So we called it Phasing.
<br>
<br>
The Phasing technique I developed is based around the "noticing" excercise given in the FAQ section. My book does go into it a LOT more though. Like, explaining all the terminology and everything, as there is simply more space to do so. Which is the main reason I started writing the book in the first place. But you can get a good idea from my FAQ thread and from reading through some of my posts on the forum. Plus, Major Tom's work, especially his Focus 10 sticky thread, will give you lots of pointers. He'll be stopping by soon so I'm sure he will suggest some things to you as well. And no doubt others will too.
<br>
<br>
Phasing is something that appears to be gaining popularity, as you can get quick results from it. Well, when done properly of course. It gives you many of the advantages of traditional obe, for example, you can still revert to the obe RTZ state from a Phasing state if you want to. But one BIG advantage is the fear side of things is very much less when compared to a typical person's experiences with the traditional mystical work. Mainly because there is never any real feeling of

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The Phasing post in the FAQ section is made up from some bits and bobs from the book and snippets have gone into posts especially over the past few months.
