Hi everyone. I'm new to APing/OBE's. At first,when someone told me about it I was just kinda like "Riiiight...". I knew about OBE's,but I had never heard of forcing yourself out and wandering around in a whole other world. My mom once told me of her OBE and how it had scared and confused her because at the time,most people would just assume you were going crazy when something like that happened to you. So,I dropped the thought until my friend showed me a site someone had made. When I saw how many members it had and how many books had been made for it,I was pretty amazed.
<br>
<br>
And now,I'm eager to learn as much as possible about this,and even have an OBE myself. Hearing about places of beauty that make you resent the thought of returning to your physical body,seeing dead pets/relatives,walking through walls...I still can barely believe that. Anyway,I will stick around on this forum. The community looks nice,and I may need a bit of advice

hi!
<br>
You are one lucky person! To have at least one of your parents involved. I know at least some can relate to having parents who would freak out at the mention of all this 'whacko' stuff as they would deem it.
<br>
Its truly hard to balance two lives at once, and one of them totally secret from the other.
<br>
Hope you get what your looking for!
