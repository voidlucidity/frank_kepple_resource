I am reading Stephen LaBerge's "Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming" and just read a chapter on WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dream).
<br>
It seems to me that the induction techniques resemble some of the phasing techniques discussed here. I was wondering what the relationship is between the 2. It would seem to me that Lucid Dreaming, and dreaming in general, is a phasing of the consciousness into a different "focus" level. LaBerge is quick to point out that he believes dreaming is all "internal" - just a phenomena produced by you, unlike the phasing/astral projection theory that you could actually meet other projectors and bring back evidence of the meeting.

Lucid dreaming is Monroe's Focus 22 state. There is the Astral bridge zone at Focus 21 and if you cross that bridge you enter into the first of the realms where thought equals direct action. In other words, as you think so it becomes all around you.
<br>
<br>
The only difference between uncontrolled dreaming and lucid dreaming is your degree of conscious control, which also affects your memory of the experience.
<br>
<br>
So where you say, "It would seem to me that Lucid Dreaming, and dreaming in general, is a phasing of the consciousness into a different "focus" level" you are quite correct. And basically that Focus level is, as I say, Focus 22.
<br>
<br>
So dreaming in general is mind at the F22 state with next to no conscious control. Lucid dreaming is mind at the F22 state with a good measure of conscious control.

Thanks Frank, it seems like everybody's theories are intertwining, which gives greater evidence that this stuff is "real." The best evidence would be for me to actually experience it for myself (via phasing), but that has been a bust so far.
<br>
<br>
I assume it would be possible for a person in a lucid dream to be able to access the higher focus levels while retaining som e conscious control? Lucid dreaming has been semi-easy for me, I usually have one when I am really trying, so I am thinking maybe I can turn my next lucid dream into a more controlled F27 experience.

Turning a lucid dream into a controlled Astral projection to a higher focus level is dead easy to say, but ever so tricky to do at the time. A lucid dream is simply where your mind is at the Focus 22 state and you are releasing all kinds of thoughts and emotions that are creating the circumstances you find yourself in. I haven't read LaBerge's work but he is quite correct to say that dreams are created by the person dreaming.
<br>
<br>
With practice, a person can teach themselves to become more conscious so they begin to see the dreamscape while it is happening, rather than remembering about it after they awake.
<br>
<br>
Now, it is at this point where it starts to get tricky. Because there are people I came across who experienced lucid dreams to the point where they became expert at creating them. So much so, they concluded that all this obe-stuff was mere emotional interplay. In other words, they got so wrapped up in creating these lucid dreams for themselves, they became blinded to all the other stuff that lay ahead.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is when you find yourself in the midst of a dream, i.e. when you become lucid, try and concentrate solely on one aspect of your dreamscape. Then ask yourself a simple question about it. You see, even though you have become lucid, your whole sense of conscious awareness will not all be with you (well, chances are it won't put it that way). So you need to first bring everything on stream.
<br>
<br>
By asking a simple question, this brings your critical faculties into play together with your senses of logic and reason. Which, in turn, swing Â into action your short-term and long-term memory banks, and so forth. Once you have full conscious awareness, then you need to become as mentally still as possible. This will have the effect of shutting down all the dreamscape. At this point you can gather a definite intent to travel to wherever you wish.
<br>
<br>
Within the Astral, Intent is the fuel that drives you from place to place. That's why you need to start from a point of mental stillness. Because whatever you focus on, becomes your reality. So if your mind is flitting here and there, your circumstances, in turn, will be flitting here and there. Which is all mighty confusing.
<br>
<br>
A handy tip to remember: it is your degree of conscious control that is the key to opening access to the higher planes. So the higher the degree of conscious control you have, the higher the Astral plane you can project to.
<br>
<br>
In the old days they talked about having to be a spiritually pure person and giving money to charity, and all that jazz, before the higher (in their line of thinking more godly) realms became open to you. When it's nothing of the kind. It's simply your degree of conscious control.
<br>
<br>
The definition of what constitutes good conscious control is the degree to which you can remain mentally still and emotionally closed. From this basis, you can then "become open" and "become closed" with a high degree of selectivity. Which does take a lot of practise. Monroe was something of an expert at doing this and he even created a list of terms which detailed the switching processes commonly encountered.

EDIT: I just read Ginny's post about her latest F23 retrieval and she gives some good examples of what I'm talking about. Like, where she says:
