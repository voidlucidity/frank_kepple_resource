Hello Everybody!
<br>
<br>
I Just got into Energy Work, about a month ago, and it's so far a very fun journey! I've been practicing moving the Psi-wheel in a jar, which I can only do so little but improving on (for people who do stuff with psi, some tips would be great!)
<br>
<br>
And I've been practicing making energy balls, the first energy ball I ever did, actually hurt my brother a little (electric sensation, all over his chest).                             And I'm slowly improving on making psi-balls(not feeling anything solid or semi-solid yet though).
<br>
<br>
I also do standing meditation, and normal meditation. Lately during meditation, I've felt a big huge energy surge or energy blockage clearing in my chest area up to the bottom of my chin, pulsating, sometimes a little bit painful.  And yesterday when i was trying to A.P. I had like a big energy blockage on my left arm.
<br>
<br>
Ok, So I've bought Astral Dynamics, and I'm only on part  2, doing the N.E.W. exercises, sometimes I have trouble feeling energy, and I have trouble with my awareness hands (How are my awareness hands supposed to look like, and how do they look when they're all the way rubbing my feet?Super long arms?) But i do sometimes see results.
<br>
<br>
And lastly, Does your physical health (being healthy or being in shape), effect the ability to Astral Project?
<br>
<br>
Oh, and thanks for such a great Forum!

Working out has always helped me project. I rarely project when I have strayed away from my exercise routine. Be sure to check out the Astral FAQ, as well
