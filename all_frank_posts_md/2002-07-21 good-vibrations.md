<section>
Something I'm very curious about is I see alot of discussion on vibrations. I get these vibrations but I call it an electric buzz. It happens mostly when I'm relaxed or in process of falling asleep yet I am fully awake when it happens or sometimes half asleep. It only lasts for about a second but it is alarming in nature and disrupts my train of thought or concentration. Sometimes i feel it throughout my entire body but mostly just my head and I see a white bright light almost like a lightning flash. This can happen several times a night as Im drifting to sleep and is usually a signal of sleep paralysis to follow which sometimes does and sometimes doesn't. Any input?
<br>
Thanx

<section>
your a member of this forum, so im assuming you want to control or learn to OBE,  well if its the latter,  your on the right track with the vibrations.  I too always lose control of them when i get them because i cant help getting excited or anxious for the seperation to end.....
<br>
Good luck

well actually what I think Id like to know is what is that buzzing sound? It seems to get louder and more intense when I struggle in sleep paralysis but sometimes I'll just be sitting on the couch relaxing and reading a book and then all the sudden..~ZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTT~ or the same thing when I'm laying in bed and trying to go to sleep..Does anyone know what this is and what causes it? I know its associated with OBE in some manner or I wouldn't have had so many of them but all my OBES cept for 2 have been totally spontaneous and all of them have happened during a sleep paralysis episode.

i don't know if that has been definatively answered. some might say it is astral sounds, i think that it may be chakra related - i remember that one of the chakras when activated can produce the buzzing of a bee.

PI: What you are calling sleep paralysis is the "mind awake, body asleep" state that is prerequisite to a conscious-exit obe. All that buzzing and vibrating is perfectly normal. I'm not sure from your posts what it is you are trying to achieve exactly, but if obe'ing is your goal then is seems like you are 95% of the way there already. Only I'd suggest rather than struggle, simply relax and allow the obe reflex to take its natural course.
<br>

Hi PI
<br>
<br>
The only thing I could add to the last rather good posts is concerning the bright flashes, almost like a lightning flash thingies. I have experienced this quite a few times myself &amp; they are a bit of a shock at first I know. When I first joined up here it was one of the first things I wanted to find out about &amp; was lucky enough to get a response from our host Robert Bruce (although it was someone elses topic they had started).
<br>
<br>
I can't remember the name of the topic back then as it was something like "bright flashes" or something, not the term "strobe" as I know it to be now.
<br>
In Astral Dynamics there was a good run down on the "strobe effect" &amp; many have posted it as a topic in here, so you might be able to glean some more info from those as well.
<br>
<br>
From what I remember, in the end, it is just like Frank said "normal". As to the mechanics of it, haha, I will leave that up to you, but check out anything on brow chakras or the strobe effect.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys

I did a bit of an experiment with sleep paralysis just now. I wanted to find out how it proceeds and what I can observe at the onset.
<br>
<br>
I lay on the rug on a concrete floor with no pillow.
<br>
First a few stretches and a couple of deep breathes to get comfy.
<br>
I tried to still my surface mind reasonably, not copletely though as I was trying to keep up a running commentary of the progress in my mind.
<br>
At about (read all times as what-felt-line-N-minutes) 5 minutes into the excersize I was pretty relaxed. The my hands (palms, forearms and then the bit between elbow and shoulder) felt a wave of warmth and I felt the muscle tone give slightly. This was followed by an electric tingling sensation and my fingers felt like they were moving. I believe the fingers bent into a relaxed position naturally. The electric tingling was rather string for a little while and then subsidized into a dull feeling that alternated a bit stronger at times.
<br>
My left leg folloowed soon and then the right one.
<br>
My torse refused to fall asleep probably due to the hard surface that prevented my back from relaxing enough.
<br>
During the time I was able to open and close my eyes and swallow without affecting the parts of my body already asleep.
<br>
During the entire time save for the first 5 or 10 minutes I was able to think, hum, whistle in my mind with no apparent effect on the paralysis.
<br>
<br>
All in all the sensations agreed with the ones I had previously experienced (as posted in "Partial Succes") . At no time did I feel or hear anything unusual which may be due to the relaxed and intentional nature of the process. It would seem logical to deduce that any weird/freaky feelings or percetions during sleep paralysis are due to its unexpected occurence or to the person feeling insecure or intimidated by the process.
<br>
<br>
I think the paralysis could and would have been more pronounced had I been more confortable but the overall experience was actually quite pleasant if somewhat unusual.

Sleep paralysis is something I can never induce..unless Im overly stressed or tired so I never know when it will strike. The fear I feel during sleep paralysis is overwhelming sometimes even though I KNOW what it is..i have been reading on the subject ever since I learned it had a name about 2 years ago. It is very hard not to struggle and Im working on that because it is what happens after the paralysis passes that I want to explore further..the OBEs and the lucid dreaming. Sometimes during the paralysis I feel that presence that someone or something is there with me but i can never see it..I have been touched by something during the paralysis but never can see what it is and on a few other occasions have seen a shadowed figure lurking nearby..BUT I can't move..can't speak..my eyes are open and I can move them but only my eyes. ONLY if I can relax enough not to break out of the paralysis will I have an OBE..the fear is what I need to get past and I can't seem to do it. Frustrating for me since I KNOW what is happening and I can't control it.
<br>
I'll look further into the buzzing sounds since that seems to be the signal that an OBE can occur.

From what I've picked up fooling around with SP the "touches" you feel are most likely involuntary muscle spasms. Since you don't really feel your body it's hard to connect the sensation with the muscles around the area.
<br>
Haven't heard any sounds yet just a buzzing feeling over the boody.
<br>
Don't try to induce the paralysis as it won't work. Just relax, clear your mind as well as you can and wait without trying. After a while the body assumes it's supposed to go to sleep and you'll feel a loss of muscle tone just before you get the buzzies. At least that's how it goes for me.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'll get a bit freaky the next time SP happens while I sleep (and it *always* does) and I suddenly become aware of it. But it'll be easier to cope with after experimenting with it.

Actually Ive never tried inducing SP(sleep paralysis) and I don't think Id want to but I do know for a fact if I have had a very stressful day and am overly tired I will most likely have one that night.
<br>
<br>
Ive had SP for 20 something years and have been experiementing with it but getting past that fear factor is the hardest thing and I still have problems doing that. But I remember once when I was in SP that I thought of 'rolling out' of my body and it worked!

By what I've reaon these forums and in literature SP is pretty much a prerequisite for having an OB.
