Hello guys,
<br>
<br>
I have a question regarding ascension. When you get to that point where you're feeling the 2nd vibrations, you're feeling heavy and you feel like you're about to float away, should you let your mind wander or should you concentrate on something? And if so, what should you concentrate on?
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much,
<br>
<br>

Not sure what you mean by the 2nd vibrations.
<br>
But you can try a number of things.
<br>
It depends on how you naturally react to the vibes.
<br>
<br>
If your the type of person to get so excited that you bring yourself out of it, you might just want to focus on relaxing and letting it happen.
<br>
<br>
If your the type of person who cant imagine things very easily, then you might just want to focus on the vibes and "listen" to them.
<br>
<br>
If your the type of person who can imagine/visualize well you might want to do something like the rope technique.
<br>
<br>
Everyone is different

I too am not sure what you mean by 2nd-vibrations. But if you mean the pre-exit vibrations then, once you are at this stage, you have plugged your collective sense of conscious awareness into the Astral body. At which point you need to concentrate on building your take-off energy.
<br>
<br>
This pre-exit stage is quite tricky to master because here you can feel all kinds of sensations, like, vibrations, flashes of light and all kinds of wrenching, popping and banging sounds. These can have the effect of snapping you out of it. Following which there is no option but to begin afresh.
<br>
<br>
You need to "tune in" to the vibrations and allow them to build. I found a way to control their intensity by modulating my breathing. But later found I could modulate their intensity just by thinking about them in a certain way. I posted on this topic a while ago.
<br>
<br>
Mainly, it is a case of "letting them build" because 99.9% of the time, in the early stages when I would have problems, it was due to fear-induced tension; even though I didn't feel scared at all and welcomed the experience, deep down, in the lower recesses of my conscious awareness, there was a fight/flight primeval survival-instinct mechanism at work that needed doubly convincing all was truly okay.
<br>
<br>
You need to let the vibrations build in intensity. As you do so, think about gently rocking from side to side. When the vibrations reach a certain intensity you will roll out of the physical into the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
However, if you lie still and allow the vibrations to reach a higher intensity, until they sound like they are screaming and screaching at you, at some point you will take-off like you've just been shot from a cannon and land within the Astral somewhere. While this is happening, the trick is to keep your "eyes" open.
<br>
<br>
I used to wonder when people spoke of Astral entrance-structures and the like. I could never understand why I hadn't seen anything of the sort despite my hundreds of Astral adventures. But recently I realised that, on take off, I would hold my "eyes" firmly shut until I came to rest.

<br>
<br>
Also, as you get more proficient at attuning to the vibrations, you will notice that you can hear them as well as feel them. At which point you will be able to not only modulate their intensity, but you will be able to home-in on specific frequencies prior to take off. For further info on this please see some of my past posings.

one interesting thing i read on the astraltravelers page is that you want to not focus on the body after the vibrations build. that seems to help me because i could just keep feeling energy surges in the body. now i try to focus out of the body, being at a distant point, falling, rope climbing, if the vibes stay too long i will just go to sleep and then exit my body about half of the time.

The 2nd vibrations could mean the difference in shift. For me they start off
<br>
slow keeping pace with the heart beat, like a shaking or rocking feeling.
<br>
Then they wind-up like a sewing machine going at high speed, which is
<br>
a very cool feeling, all I do after that is concentrate my vision upwards through
<br>
what I am seeing. And the rest happens by itself...

I am one of those people who gets so excited I snap out of it. I will therefore try to relax my mind. I will also try Frank's suggestion of building up my takeoff energy. I can sorta tune into the vibes already. Since I have trouble relaxing to the extent which is required for astral travel, I noticed that it helps if I'm already relaxed from having a good day, etc.
<br>
<br>
As ar as 2nd vibrations go, I was referring to the ones you get deep down inside that feel like your soul is shaking. I think they are pre-exit. It's hard to tell because I've only had one experience, but I think that's probably right.
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Frank, for the clarification on what technique to use depending on whether you want to project into real-time or astral! I didn't realise there were two different approaches like that. I read some of the posts on this, but it wasn't made that clear to me.
<br>
<br>
I will also try focusing away from the body...I've read suggestions stating you should try imagining where you want to go before you there.
<br>
<br>
Take care everyone and happy journeys!
