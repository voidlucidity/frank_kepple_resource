I seem to have a knack for sudden RTZ APs, early in the morning but have found with increasing annoyance, that I can hardly move and vision is slightly impaired when these occurs.
<br>
<br>
The other morning, I ended up spinning around basically with no control and had to return.  As fun as it was, is there any way to help gain control on movement and clarity?  Aside from the 'clarity now' command, anyone know of anything else that may work?
<br>
<br>
Jerky walking and uncorrectional vision (I can't move my head/look side to side), are really annoying me.
<br>
<br>
Anyone have any ideas how to combat this?

What you are experiencing is how it tends to be. But if you persist then it will come good after a while of practice. In the beginning it took me 5 years of trial and error just to gain a degree of proper lucidity. Where I realised that I was entering an environment where thought equals action and I could keep good control over my projection experience.
<br>
<br>
Okay, when I first started there was no internet so progress was made through my own trial and error. But still, there is a big difference between knowing it and doing it. So I reckon it would have taken me at least a year, possibly two, even if I had been told of the nature of the environment I was projecting to.
<br>
<br>
I first projected into the RTZ after having had hundreds of previous experiences in other realms of non-physical reality. So I had good experience of retaining control, etc. So my initial RTZ experiences were fairly straightforward. But I do know that spinning around out of control and zapping back to physical is a common thing with people just starting out.

<section>
thanks Frank.
<br>
<br>
*sigh*  now I know there's a long road ahead.  Any experience is a good one I guess, to look at it optimistically.

Thanks for the advice but I'm quite surprised at how far I've come in a couple of months!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

We all think you have done great. Because people such as myself who were at this in the early days, before Internet forums, (I first started in the early 1980's) would have struggled for maybe a year or more just to get where you are in a couple of months. So there's a little perspective to help you. What I am trying to say is please don't go getting despondent, because you are doing really well.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Nope.  Not getting despondent.  I'm just quite happy with whatever happens no matter what it is at the moment because it's "something"
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the perspective!

And also, thanks for your help!  Your knowledge is really appreciated here, as well as all the things I'm learning and telling my friend whom is also attempting AP.
<br>
<br>
I'm not one to quit, in anything!
