<section>
Last night I was enjoying the audio delights of listening to music while in the 'Focus 12' state; that state of 3d blackness some people are familiar with. Not everyone knows about the properties of the 3d blackness state so i thought I would point out that you don't just have to float in a peaceful black abyss, although that is also nice sometimes.
<br>
<br>
Next time, just imagine a nice piece of music... absolutely anything you want, classical music or whatever. You will notice that very quickly it goes from just a thought to a reality! You will start to hear it all around you.. focus more and the music increases in quality and clarity until it is booming all around you in glorious dolby 50000000000000000.1 surround sound... forget your hi-fi.. in fact forget even the Albert Hall.. here music sounds even better than its does rendered in the physical world, don't ask me how I can tell, just experience it for yourself.
<br>
As i said, it doesnt just have to be classical music either.. the duke box is only as large as your imagination! Last night I thought of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.... Now THAT was something worth hearing!
<br>
<br>
This time I modified it with a visual. I tried to imagine somewhere where this music might come from and an 'astral window' appeared in front of me that seemed to show some kind of bar/club area with a band on stage, I was viewing from the vantage point of the audiance but I wasnt actually 'in ' the scene, ie i hadnt actually 'phased' into it.. i was just observing from the window of my Focus 12 state. Event so the quality of the image never fails to amaze me.. forget your plasma screen tvs too. This has led me to come up with another idea.. if you can remember your favourite film well enough then you can play it in this state and enjoy it with audio and picture quality even better than the original picture! I might try that... also eventialy I might think what the hell and jump into the scene and take part myself!
<br>
<br>
Ok some might accuses me of mundane use of the greater reality.. but as well as exploring it on a wider level, I don't see any harm in a bit of useless fun now and again..  thats right.. fun... its not illegal you know!

I've only had one clear experience while listening to music.  I was listening to Secret Garden,  looking at the blackness and next thing I see is a large field of flowers and I'm just running through them.   I enjoyed the feeling of it more than anything..can't explain it.. it was just wonderful.

Douglas - I've had this happen a few times just before a traditional RTZ OBE - the difference in sound from the "original" is indescribable - it can literally take your breath away.  It never fails to transfix me.  You are right - it is so loud - but not grating or

loud.  I think "all encompassing" would be my description.  I've never had the noggin to decide what I'm listening to, they've always just happened to me, nevertheless each song is a treasured memory and is all the more special when I listen to it in my physical life.

Hi Shinobi, providing you're in full control of your faculties, you should be able to will it to stop. After all, it is your intent that got the music going in the first place!

I'm a musician and I find that sometimes when meditating and such I am able to hear many melodies that are very beautiful, it, to me, sounds as if these pitches and notes are produced from low frequencies that render them as overtones. Truely an amazing sound however.

That sounds like a blast Gandalf.
<br>
<br>
Really stimulates the imagination on what is possible in focus 12/21.
<br>
<br>
I think Frank used to enjoy watching chariot races in the old style.
<br>
<br>
I myself am a sucker for any water scene (waterfalls, surf, lakes, etc) in my mostly momentary glimpses of focus 12..
<br>
<br>
Add a little music to that, and it really is something.

Doug:
<br>
<br>
I'm pleased that other people are experiencing this now. When I first mentioned this several years ago about how I often float in the blackness listening to my favourite music, I'm sure people must have thought I was a bit crazy. But it's true! And the sound, as you mention, is just
<u>
 phenomenal
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
It is also highly addictive. He he, I had to stop doing it because that is all I was doing, lol. So now I ration myself to once or twice a week. Sometimes I spend hours just floating and having all kinds of wondrous music envelop me.
<br>
<br>
It's incredible when you think about it, that the "place" where we do this is actually the infamous Void, of old mystical fame; the place where all the demons and devils are meant to be. Getting "trapped in the void" is still a primary fear of many who follow the more traditional mystical works.
<br>
<br>
As always, they totally miss the point (because they
<i>
 objectify
</i>
everything) and fail to realise the Void is a wondrously magical place. But when I say magical, I don't mean all the black-magic tosh. I mean magical as in having nice things come about. Lot's of peace and harmony, and integration with nature and all that. But I don't mean going to the other extreme either with all the fluffy-bunny brigade. They are just as clueless as the doom and gloom boys, because again they
<i>
 objectify
</i>
everything, blah, blah, blah.
<br>
<br>
The only "problem" with the Void is whatever you think about automatically comes true for you. This is
<u>
 so
</u>
wonderful because it's like a real live Wishing Well. Whatever you want to come true, you just create! And it doesn't cost you anything!
<br>
<br>
The other thing I have found, that you might like to experiment with, which relates to why I call it a Wishing Well, is this is the place where you can generate all manner of "probabilities" for insertion into your future physical timeline. It's quite tricky and involved, takes a lot of explanation, and I am by no means an expert at it (yet, he he).
<br>
<br>
You already came across the "screen" effect. Well, rather than watching any old movie, place the Intent to see a movie of some part of your life. You will find you are able to playback all manner of scenes from your past. Okay, so in brief, here's what you do for the "future":
<br>
<br>
The future is by no means "fixed in stone". The future comes about as a particular mix of probabilities you choose to bring into physical existence from Focus 2oC (which is where the Void is, right on the "edge" of Focus 2). The way you can start giving yourself a future advantage, then, is to specifically create future probabilities that you wish to come about. The place where you do this is in the Void, as it were.
<br>
<br>
Rather than playing back the past, simply play back your desired future.
<br>
<br>
Realise I'm skirting over a LOT of detail here and I go into it much more in my book. But all you need to do is use your imagination to create as detailed a scene as possible, about whatever it is you want to come true for you. In doing this it helps to be practical, after all, you don't want to be going against your existing belief constructs too strongly. So if you create a reality where the next day you physically fly to the moon, then, chances are, it will not come about as a physical reality.
<br>
<br>
I found this works best with small details.
<br>
<br>
Your perception creates your reality, but heavily influencing of your perception are all the belief constructs that you currently subscribe to. This means you can easily get into a situation where one part of you is happy to experiment and go along with the new process. But another more commanding part of you is looking on with bemusement at what on earth you are trying to do, and will actively resist any change in your internal status quo.
<br>
<br>
So that's why I find it best to make
<u>
 small
</u>
incursions into the active reality-creation process. This is about where I am with this at the moment.
<br>
<br>
Take a small area of your life where you may be having difficulties. Go to the Void, set the scene and have the characters engage in a kind of stage-play. You will be the director of that stage-play as well as playing the central character (which is a bit freaky at first but you get used to it). Now direct the stage-play in accordance with your chosen directions.
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying absolutely everything you create will come true as a matter of fact. But the past year that I have been experimenting with this, I have had circumstances
<u>
 regularly
</u>
come about that were definitely beyond coincidence.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, if you get the time have a play and see what comes about.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Frank: This is a facinating idea you are talking about and you know what? This isnt the first time i heard about this; you have just reminded me about an old book i read years ago, this was an  old book on witchcraft (believe it or not) in a section about a most powerful 'spell' to bring about major changes in your life... generating love luck and wealth and all that.
<br>
<br>
It went something like this:
<br>
The spell involves an inward journey to what was described as 'the inner sanctum of your mind' and involved visualising a giant pentagram.. in the centre of the pentagram imagine a door. Next you imgaine this door opening.. through this door in the centre of the pentagram you should envisage a blinding white light shining out, but in the centre of this white light is a *circle of darkness* a black disk.. the next thing you do is concentrate on this black disk.. as you do you will find yourself moving towards it until finally you are absorbed into it.. you will now be in a *black void*... floating around. Next it said that if you turn around you will see the circle through whcih you 'entered' and see your body on the other side of it...
<br>
<br>
you are now in the 'inner sanctum of your mind'.. now all you do to change aspects of your life is *say aloud* (or rather think aloud) some kind of affirmation about how you want to see money or more specifically opportunity coming into your life and all the rest of it.
<br>
once the experience is over.. you should notice the 'spell' coming into effect and you will notice opportunites appearing for you like never before, jobs, relationships, luck and so on.
<br>
<br>
Now, after reading this i thought the old bat who wrote it was most likely nuts and i remember throwing the book away soon after (can't even remember what it was called).
<br>
<br>
I had completely forgotten about it until you just came up with that suggestion!  its just reminded me about the witchcraft book!!
<br>
The old bat wasnt nuts after all! If you see past the additional mystical stuff about pentagrams etc.. it is clear that she is describing a technique for getting into the 'Focus 12' or '3d blackness' state! Furthermore, she is describing how, through affirmations in this state you can dramatically alter your physical world circumstances! She said this 'spell' was a little short of sensational.. maybe she was right after all. I do remember she said in her book that soon after carrying out this technique she had started a new business and was raking in the cash and she was becoming incredibly 'lucky' and so on.
<br>
<br>
Because of the amazing similarities between what she appears to have been on about and what you have just said, I think you may be onto something; what's more, it appears that there are some people out there that have been secretly on to this for a long time already!

Doug:
<br>
<br>
This doesn't surprise me. As you know I don't entangle myself in any belief-constructs such as "witchcraft" or "devil worship" or that kind of stuff. But the odd one or two publications that I have come across, mainly just bits and bobs I've flipped through on the Internet, I can usually see where they are basically coming from.
<br>
<br>
All they appear to be doing, ultimately, is the same basic action but they lay on it a whole load of objectified religious or quasi-religious beliefs. This wouldn't be too bad, I suppose, if it were just one layer. But layer upon layer of objectified crud has been heaped on top of one another over thousands of years. To the point where the pure actions have largely been lost.
<br>
<br>
Well, not lost as far as you and I are concerned (and others of the same ilk, of course), as we don't carry around all that superfluous emotional baggage.
<br>
<br>
The biddy who wrote the book was largely correct. But still there is no need for "giant pentagrams" and doorways and stuff, and you are not actually at "the inner sanctum" of your mind (merely Focus 2 of consciousness). But these constructs, while they are unnecessary and/or incorrect, would not detract from the effectiveness of the core action of bettering ones future.
<br>
<br>
The simple fact is, that the physical is what is known as a source/manifest system. The source of all individual actions in consciousness, in terms of the Phasing model, is Focus 2. The manifest actions come about within Focus 1. It gets a little more complex with group actions as Focus 3 starts coming into play
<i>
 to an extent
</i>
and the ultimate source, or the blueprints of
<u>
 all
</u>
actions in consciousness within our system is Focus 4. But that is all quite complex, and people don't need to understand it all before they can make a start.
<br>
<br>
So to begin, people who were attempting to align their thinking to the Phasing model of consciousness, if they would simply think of individual actions (for now) and think of the source as being Focus 2, and the actions of which are manifest within Focus 1.
<br>
<br>
The Void can be thought of as a blank sheet of paper. Instead of writing or drawing on it, you superimpose your thoughts on it. The Void has no prejudices at all, it has no real "life of its own" so to speak. So whatever thoughts you superimpose on it
<u>
 will
</u>
become manifest in the moment. Thinking about it, a modern-day term is long overdue. We can't keep calling it the Void and 3D Blackness, as these terms fall way short, IMO. Plus, my pet term of "Wishing Well" is just way too girlie. So we need a nice macho name for it, LOL.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the best way of perceiving the images presented is to create some kind of video screen. Doing this creates an overall element of being in control; as you can "stand back" from it all, and watch events being played on a screen rather than being immersed in them. If events come about that you don't like, then it becomes a simple matter of "switching channels" on your "remote".
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, in the past, people did not have this kind of handy visualisation example, as there were no tellys, of course. So they ended up being immersed in all kinds of superstitious mumbo-jumbo. Once you get embroiled, it is extremely difficult to extricate yourself from the circumstances of it.
<br>
<br>
Note: a number of times I have experimented with allowing circumstances to get
<u>
 very
</u>
out of control by generating lots of fear, for example. That was actually quite a difficult thing for me to do as I kept laughing. But once I got myself being chased by a few giant tigers that seemed to do the trick, lol. It is surprising, actually, how you can readily get yourself "caught" in circumstances where you appear "trapped" and you can't get out of it!
<br>
<br>
Give it a go yourself, just for the experience, and you'll see what I mean. But I would stress to anyone else reading this, you need to be fully comfortable in your own mind before playing around in this way, as it can be very unsettling *if* you are not entirely confident about what you are doing. But I do suggest people practice letting circumstances get "out of control" so it gives them an idea of where all the talk of devils and demons came from, lol.
<br>
<br>
But, as I say, the very best way of protecting yourself from becoming immersed in the circumstances is to bring them up "on screen" as it were.
<br>
<br>
All we are basically doing here is having a highly controlled "lucid dream" where absolutely every element of our dreamscape is under our control. The Void is part of F2oC, in a manner of speaking, and this is also the area of consciousness where most people do their dreaming. You can think of an ordinary dream as the action of entering the Void, if you like, but with no real degree of conscious control. This is where people are just wandering about and releasing a huge mix of thoughts and feelings and it's all becoming manifest all around them, moment by moment, as they do so.
<br>
<br>
Once you start getting an understanding of the Void, great chunks of knowledge starts falling into place and you begin realising how our system is constructed. Well, that is what happened with me.
<br>
<br>
The Void can be thought of as raw consciousness if you like. You will no-doubt have heard me talk about "actions in consciousness". Well, what we perceive as "Void" is, in fact, raw consciousness, for want of a better term. Or you might think of it as the ultimate Base Material from which everything is ultimately constructed.
<br>
<br>
Void has many uses. For example, it holds all manner of individual and group constructs. One of the most popular actions it performs is that of memory, particularly what we call our short-term memory. When we want to remember something we are merely impressing those thoughts within a personal section of Void. You can also "travel" within areas of the void you have set aside for individual use, for example. All your core belief constructs are held there. You can also manifest the objective actions of belief constructs such as "astral travel". Or whatever else takes your fancy: fighting with devils and demons, slaying dragons, and all manner of stuff. You can chat to "god" or to the "devil" or to any construct you happen to subscribe to. There are no limits. If you want to bring these constructs into objective reality you can. As I say, there are no ultimate  limits. The only "limits" are the ones we place on ourselves for the purposes of our experience.
<br>
<br>
One handy metaphor I use for how Void is set up, is it's like a computer and computer memory. Some of the memory is taken up by the actual system, which goes to ultimately objectively displaying information on a screen (this is your physical life). Then you have a spare section of memory that can be used for ad-hoc tasks (this is what we perceive as Void). Then, say, you had a top-section of memory that was connected to everyone else's top-section of memory that formed a part of memory that was common to all. In this top section was held all manner of group constructs, or group actions in consciousness. The details of all these actions are available to you, and you can choose which of them to "bring into" your personal area for ultimate manifestation on the screen, i.e. into your physical reality.
<br>
<br>
The memory part taken up by the system, so to speak, are your personal areas where you hold all manner of information about actions in consciousness pertaining to your own self; the workings of your own physical body, your beliefs, your memory, your personality traits, habits, likes and dislikes, and so on. All these private actions-in-consciousness are held in a "used" or "reserved" section of Void that pertains to you as a physical individual, and this used area opens out into an unused area, or consciousness "workspace" if you like.
<br>
<br>
In its entirety, that is all Focus 2 of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
The personal, unused area opens out into a group area. When religious types, particularly new-age religious subscribers talk about all of us "being one". Essentially, they are talking about our group connection that "begins" at Focus 3 of consciousness. We are not "all one" as we retain our individuality throughout. But we are not as disconnected as it would appear in our physical lives either. Again, I think of it in computer terms. If I connect my computer to the Internet, I
<u>
 still
</u>
retain the individuality of my machine! Even though I can now "dip into" the areas of group computer memory that have been made available for that purpose. In doing so, I may choose to download certain information and store it in an area of memory on my machine for private use.
<br>
<br>
We human beings are remarkably similar. Both you and I are individuals, but we are connected to a variety of group constructs that have been made available for our group use. Ultimately, we can choose to "download" this information and bring it into our physical manifestation or not. With most people, however, and that includes you and I, this process is largely automatic as it is
<i>
 highly
</i>
influenced by peer-group behaviour, together with other social factors.
<br>
<br>
Changing your future reality, then, is all a question of generating new probable actions, rather than continuing with existing actions or subscribing to other group actions. In a sense, you begin to "pave your own way" by creating your
<u>
 own
</u>
probable actions within your blank workspace. Which is the place mystics call the Void.
<br>
<br>
Note: any action generated within F2oC that has not been manifest into F1oC is known as a
<i>
 probable
</i>
action.
<br>
<br>
Then you allow these probable actions to bleed into your physical life. Which sounds real easy in theory, but in practice you are battling against all the deeply held, long-standing belief constructs that you already hold in your individual "system" areas. These beliefs are
<u>
 highly
</u>
influencing of your perception. The intransigent nature of these actions unfortunately tends to override anything you try and put in their place. But once you know about how the system works, together with what factors influence what, you can then form a kind of "action plan" that allows you to make gradual inroads into yourself.
<br>
<br>
The Void continues on and forms the Transition Area. This is where we "go to" when we die, or rather, permanently disengage physical focus. This is the area mystics generally call the Afterlife. All it is, is a section of Void we have reserved for our particular use of engaging transition back into subjective reality. This, in terms of the Phasing Model, is Focus 3. And the subjective reality we eventually "go back" to is Focus 4.
<br>
<br>
And that completes the model of our system.
<br>
<br>
As I have said before, these Focuses are NOT places! They are focuses of attention. We already "occupy" these areas. They are of our own mind, so to speak. They are not, in any way, separate from ourselves. They ARE ourselves, but in a wider sense. It's just that there are parts of ourselves that we "occupy" as a singular construct and there are parts of ourselves that we occupy as a group construct. So when you find yourself within the 3D Blackness, you are not at some separate place. You are still within your own mind. All that has changed is your
<i>
 focus of attention
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Okay, well, that's a summary as brief as I can make it. Problem is the subject of reality creation and the interaction between F2 and F1 of consciousness is a complex topic. In other words, it's not something you can readily explain within the boundaries of a post to a thread. But I hope I've given you a good overview of the process so you can have a "play".
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
While I haven't actually gotten to the "Void" that I remember, I'd like to mention that in my experience, even being in a nice relaxed trance (F10) and listening to normal music (from headphones) is more pleasant than normal. Something about being in a trance state seems to amplify emotions and senses to a higher degree.
<br>
<br>
In my personal practices with phasing, I like to listen to the Monroe Institutes's "Transcendence" entrainment, and sometimes when that's up it'll go to another song in my play-list, and it always sounds so nice.
<br>
<br>
I find it really interesting, though, that you can listen to any song at all in the "Void" as if it were a recording (instead of say, like it would sound if you were just thinking of it from memory, which is often spotty and repetitious). I wonder if you could listen to a song you've never heard before but that physically exists?

But free songs without annoying DJs or maddening ads? That's highly uncivilized! Everyone knows Rome was built on promises of cheap liquor and lots of gambling (or was that Caesar's Palace?)

 "I wonder if you could listen to a song you've never heard before but that physically exists?"
</i>
<br>
<br>
Yes, done this loads of times. Have listened to songs that I have never heard before (have no idea whether they physically exist either). Also, I've watched TV stations, listened to radio channels that I've never seen or heard of physically.

Fascinating - I was just looking through some old poems I wrote.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to share one here - it's before I'd ever heard of OBEs (or experienced them consciously).  It's written about a track by Moby.  Amazing that I use the word "void"!

The music removes me
<br>
From myself
<br>
To my inner world
<br>
Just me, just me
<br>
<br>
The beauty of it
<br>
Enwraps me totally
<br>
I succumb
<br>
And float
<br>
<br>
Held up by sound
<br>
The only substance in the void
<br>
And me, and me
<br>
What peace

I was once under a severe psychic attack. My astral buddies responded for me by pulling in music, it was almost as if they were pulling it from my own sense memories, to act as a camouflage for me. It happened to be the choral movement of Beethoven's 9th. It was as real as if it was being performed in my room, surrounding me and making it impossible for the assailants to pick me out. Or maybe it simply swamped them. It was so beautiful that I kept listening to it, even when I thought I was safe again.
<br>
This took place in Perth, Scotland. Are there some territorial types living there? A dark coven?

These post are amazing!  Bump.  For newbies, this is FZ they are talking about, or the 3d blackness.

I just thought of something. If your short term memory is in the void then could telepathy be accessing someone else's part of the void?

That's a good question, labouts. I think on some level, nothing is "secret", but I think you'd have to have a state of mind where you could handle that.

<br>
BTW, I like your sig. The same goes for me.
