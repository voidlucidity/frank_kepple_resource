Dangers of having OBE
<br>
<br>
Not until recently this year I did not know what I have been experiencing, I thought they were just dreams, until a friend started talking about them and I did some research on the internet and seems very similar.
<br>
<br>
I am still somewhat unsure what state I am in when I am having a OBE, These are the Two questions I have.
<br>
<br>
Is there any dangers what so ever while having a OBE, I ask this because I fear cause I am out of my physical body I can be taken by something maybe a spirit or something, again I ask this because I am not sure what state I am in when having a OBE, is it still a dream or am I out of body somewhat like a spirit.
<br>
<br>
When I have a OBE, I am in my house starting from my bedroom usually, there have been a couple of times I have seem someone in my house when I am having OBE I would get very frightened and return or wake up immediately.  Who am I seeing, other spirits or what.

Hey there Phil.....welcome to the board.  I can only speak from my own experiences, but I have never come across anything remotely dangerous which would have convinced me that OBE's/AP's were bad for you.
<br>
<br>
One of th biggest fears is exactly what you have described: the fear of having someone (or something) else take over your body when you are 'out.'  This is usually based on the
<i>
 assumption[/] that you're indeed completely OUT of your body, leaving only an empty shell behind.
 <br>
 <br>
 Personally, I do not subscibe to this theory.  I believe that we never leave this body fully.  Instead, we expand our consciousness to percieve and project things which are outside the walls of our five physical senses.
 <br>
 <br>
 For example, have you ever seen that movie "The Abyss"?  If so, do you remember when the alien beings took the form of water and began to explore the ship by slithering through each room?  I view our astral projections like that.  We never really leave the body, but we expand outwards and from there, we can explore anything.
 <br>
 <br>
 I think that possibly a lot of people who attribute possesions to their out of body experiences are those who already have a slight mental imbalance, and experiencing something as wild as OBE/AP's just pushes them over the edge.  Just my opinion though.
 <br>
 <br>

 You're quite possibly seeing either an astral entity (one who normally exists in that realm), a dreamer (someone who is dreaming and their spirit body is walking around), another projector, a guide, or simply another aspect of a family member.
 <br>
 <br>
 For example, there have been numerous times that I've projected to my kitchen to see my father standing there.  Now, physically during that hour, my father would have been at work, so how could I see him in the kitchen?   believe that we're all multi-dimensional beings.  Part of you is reading this right now, and another aspect of you might be at your favorite vacation spot.  When you strip away all these burdening thoughts and you see the energy of your environment in the astral realms, you may start to interact with these multi-dimensional aspects of people.
 <br>
 <br>
 So in my case above, there is no doubt in my mind that I was interacting with my dad in some form or another.  It's just our logical minds try to say, "Well Jeff, you couldn't have been talking to your dad in the kitchen because he's not physically in the kitchen.  He is at work right now."

Robert Bruce, in his PDF file (Treastie), explains the Mind-Split effect, where when a conscious OOBE occurs, your consciousness splits in two. One part remains in your body, while the other is free to roam in its astral body counterpart. You should read up on this as it will hopefully quash all your fears concerning this. One claim he makes is that your aura expands to encompass a large area, and that while the mind-split effect is occuring, it acts as a spiritual security field. Any negative astral entities or presences or energies disturbing this field causes a reaction that immediately snaps your other half back into your body... supposedly.

Phil- why don't you ask the entity it's name or what it is doing in your house? The only thing I would worry about is if there  is anything in your subconcious that could harm you.

Sort of carrying on with ralphm's idea . . . .  if you are going to move about the OBE realms, it's best that you shake any ghosties and ghoulies out of your head first.  Because if you don't, when you get "out," you will meet them face-to-face, where you'll have to deal with them like people.
<br>
<br>
Remember!  Most of the hard work on OBE is done in the day-to-day, in the so-called ordinary realm.  Fill your mind and heart with love, peace, and fun, and your OBE experiences will bring you great awe and joy.

<section>
Phil, despite the abundance of the popular and oft-quoted advice that there is no danger in astral traveling, that we don't truly leave our bodies, and that any negative entities are simply psychological constructs, there is indeed possibility of danger. It is rare, but nonetheless, common sense is the watchword. There are a few here whose knees will jerk at this statement, and they'll accuse this of being "a fear-based reaction"; not so; it is elementary common sense.
<br>
<br>
The multiverse is a continuum. There is no "inner" or "outer", but rather an infinite series of wave intereference patterns in the implicate order creating our holographs of consciousness in the explicate. In practical terms, all is interconnected, and to posit that it is not is to make a tremendous mind/body split that doesn't truly exist. Therefore, when certain supposed experts here say, "the non-physical realm is totally harmless", they fail to take into account that it is made of the same stuff as our so-called "physical" realm. If there are dangers "here", there are dangers "there", and it makes sense to use basic caution (which is NOT a fear-based reaction). True, the "laws" of traveling in the realms vary, and events manifest differently, but that doesn't mean that the "non-physical" is totally benign.
<br>
<br>
In my experience, the etheric realm -- R. Bruce's "real-time" -- is in part populated by shamans, brujos, shapeshifters, voodoo practitioners shooting poisonous thought-darts at one another, etc. It is also possible to encounter here one's own negative thought-forms, and these as well can be dangerous. In either case, it makes sense to be charged up energetically, and prepared for the unexpected. It's a huge multiverse and we must never take anything in it for granted. It is both benevolent and capricious.
<br>
<br>
I myself have experienced the realm of what I call "id" creatures -- the brutish aspects of ourselves that have been repressed for millenia of enculturation. I have myself been in id-creature mode, and have met others of this nature. When in such condition I am almost pure instinct, out for myself, and have come close to messing with the auric fields of others. This is a real possibility, despite what the nay-sayers on this board pronounce. It is possible to cause sickness and even physical death to others with such energetic interference.
<br>
<br>
Mostly, OBE travel is safe, but "safe" is a relative term, and, as I say, we must take nothing for granted; to do so is to admit we are God, and know the entirety of the cosmos. For those of us who have not yet realized godhood I suggest elementary caution n their approach to dreamwork, phasing, remote viewing, and OBEs.
<br>
<br>
Prayer, love, and trust in God/greater self will take you a long way, though; all I ask is that, as in "physical" existence, you make allowances for that which you might not expect. To not do so is naive, and those who advise otherwise are giving possibly dangerous information to beginning astral travelers.
<br>
<br>
Note: Some here will immediately counter with the old argument: "Don't we project during dreams? And when we do so, aren't we always protected?"
<br>
<br>
My answer is, yes, we do project during dreams, and, while some automatic protection seems to be triggered when we OOB this way, it is not always enough. Haven't you ever wakend from an awful dream to find your day ruined, and your body distinctly ill? Awareness should be cultivated in dreaming as well as during OBEs.
<br>
<br>
Some will say, in inevitable, ratcheting robotic tape-loop fashion, as if reading from well-worn punch-card script, "Belief that non-physical travel is dangerous is displaying a lack of familiarity with the territory. It means one is dragging his beliefs from the physical into the non-physical."
<br>
<br>
To which I counter: There is no such split between the physical and non-physical; it is only an apparent one. In essence, all is seamlessly connected. To those who believe we are only traveling within our own minds, I suggest you examine the contraditions in your own posts when you write of interacting with other beings in the astral. In truth we are ALL "out there" (or "in here" -- whatever), and are co-creators of reality. If we were not, then each of us would be trapped in a solipsistic universe, without any contact of others.
<br>
<br>
Know that astral travel is largely safe, but keep your wits about you. Don't assume anything about the unknown. And beware of those who endlessly harp that caution is the same thing as a "fear reaction."

Hi Phil,
<br>
just thought that I would Let you know that I know exactly how you feel,I,ve seen things,things that I too cannot explain,I have felt the fear and found it hard in the past to fully separate and enter into the astral world because of the fear but one thing that I feel I have to stress to you is this-------I have never been harmed--------never,and I do not believe that I ever will be.
<br>
Could these things  we see be actual beings e.t.c from the astral world  ? or spirits that live in our homes that the astral world somehow allows us to see ?.
<br>
It didn,t happen to me on every past Astral visit,just some,and I hope that I don,t see anything too bizzare on any future Asral visits but if I do I think I can handle it.
<br>
Usual features of my past Astral flights are: a door made of white light--
<br>
A strong presence of a being, sometimes seen ,sometimes just felt , a feeling of shear blizz,so pleasurable that words cannot describe any feeling like it------------these are just the basic facts of my past Astral flight,they accompany any other feeling but sometimes , just sometimes the blizz was replaced by shear terror that sent me straight back into my body.

  Dangers of having OBE
  <br>
  Is there any dangers what so ever while having a OBE, I ask this because I fear cause I am out of my physical body I can be taken by something maybe a spirit or something, again I ask this because I am not sure what state I am in when having a OBE, is it still a dream or am I out of body somewhat like a spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  When I have a OBE, I am in my house starting from my bedroom usually, there have been a couple of times I have seem someone in my house when I am having OBE I would get very frightened and return or wake up immediately.  Who am I seeing, other spirits or what.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, there is a big danger that for centuries has led people into experiencing all manner of difficulties. The primary cause of these difficulties is where people form conclusions about what they either perceive (or think they may perceive) within Astral reality: based on their experiences within Physical reality.
<br>
<br>
I call this Astral Anthropomorphism.
<br>
<br>
A typical example is that of thinking someone can slip into your physical body whilst you are "out". Like the body were some kind of physical possession that could be stolen from you if left unattended.
<br>
<br>
Another one that crops up often is due to the way Astral perception can often come across in a multi-layered kind of way. Whereas the Physical environment is generally perceived as a single layer.
<br>
<br>
On the Physical, if we are sitting in a room then we see the surroundings of the room. And if we, at the same time, see other people within the walls of that room we naturally conclude those people we are seeing are also in the room.
<br>
<br>
Which, you might think is a very obvious thing to state. After all, if we are sitting in a room and we can obviously see other people in that same room, then where else could those people be but with us in that room. This is all very obvious within Physical reality, but not necessarily true when applied to Astral reality.
<br>
<br>
A major stumbling block is caused by the fact that when we "go obe" (for want of a better term) the sense of conscious awareness we take with us, is the exact same one we have with us on the Physical. In other words, when projecting we don't automatically create this super sense of Astral understanding all primed and geared for comprehending Astral reality. It is unfortunate that with most people (myself included) getting the right degree of understanding and control takes years of trial and error.
<br>
<br>
Big problem is, because of the inherent nature of the Astral environment it is
<u>
 ever so easy
</u>
to go off on a tangent and become your own self-fullfilling prophecy. The reason why this occurs is because, in many ways, the Astral acts as a perfect mirror that serves to reflect whatever emotion, thought, idea, wish, need, want, etc., etc., back to you. But it does so in a seamless and ever so subtle way that forever catches people out.
<br>
<br>
Basically, within the Astral, your ability to perceive is directly linked to your willingness to believe. So what you "believe in" largely determines your experiences, which the Astral instantly reflects back at you...
<i>
 thus reinforcing the original belief(s)
</i>
. Which has the effect of making you believe it more (whatever "it" is, the Astral doesn't make judgments) so you perceive it more; so you believe it more; so you perceive it more; so you believe it more... and so it goes on.
<br>
<br>
But I think things will change as progressively more people communicate their experiences and learn about the basic ground rules that apply.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Phil, one of the biggest dangers of OBE travel is the advice that the only dangers out there are your own thought-projections, and that these can't really hurt us, because they are "illusions." Such naive advice fails to take into account three things 1) our own thought-projections CAN hurt us if we aren't prepared to deal with them; they may result in damage to our auric fields, in mental illness, and in actual sickness. When someone tells you that illusions lack true danger, politely disregard their advice and back away from them. Remember, ultimately, everything is an illusion, including the so-called physical; it is all just waves and particles. Does that make it any less dangerous? 2) There are others in the etheric, astral, and mental realms, and we interact with them; it is possible that some of them may not have our best interests in mind. Some may be capable of messing with the subtle energies of your aura, or inflicting doubts, and even diseases; consider certain negative dream-contacts you've had, and the bad days that resulted. The "mental projection" people don't really believe we interact with others during OBEs; they think everything we encounter is merely formed of our own thoughts. Such an idea is absurd. 3) The universe is infinite, and to make any assumptions about it, such as that the non-physical environment is harmless, is to take the universe for granted. It is, in fact, a way of proclaiming oneself God, because by stating that you know the complete nature of the universe, you are advertising your own omniscience. In our human forms we have access to the infinity of knowledge, but we are also parts, and so lack total perspective. It is unwise to claim that the so-called non-physical is completely safe.
