I've been trying to project/force an OBE for ages and I've finally done it not half an hour ago. I didn't actually manage to get out of my body but I could see through my eyelids for a few seconds and I had a sensation of complete weightlessness for about a minute. Obviously I got excited and unfortunately this snapped me out of it.

This question has probably been asked a thousand times here already but hey I'm new

. How do I get out of my body once I'm feeling all wavy and seey-through-eyeliddy?

Hi:
<br>
<br>
From what you say it would appear the solution is to stop getting all excited and that will hopefully mean you won't keep snapping out of it, as you say. With the traditional "techniques" excitement and fear, tend to feature predominantly.
<br>
<br>

I echo with Frank here. I have this fear/excitement problem myself; Â however, the more I practice, I get used to the sensations and my perception of the whole thing changes. I become more like an observer, but it does take time.

I tried to project again later on yesterday. The experience lasted a little longer, I tried to distance myself from feeling excited and remain calm like I've been reading in every text I have found on projection. Although the experience lasted longer I saw something very clear for a few seconds but then it shrunk into a small point at the centre of my vision then disappeared, not unlike what you would see switching an old T.V. off.

Interesting... Maybe you need to do more concentration exercises? (Page 208-212 Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce)
