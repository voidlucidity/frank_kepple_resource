Hi,
<br>
<br>
I was just wondering if anyone out there has had a problem with their sight whilst projecting.

Yes. I usually have sight problems when my eyes are closed.

I to have had problems with my vision but the main problem is that i seem to have no control of my astral body it just seems to bounce all over the place does anyone have any suggestions on how to control this.

We have sight problems when starting OBE because the stuff we would see is very complex and we dont understand it enough.

Sight problems and control problems are all VERY NORMAL at first. The only real solution is practice, practice and yet more practice and it will start to come together at some stage. Unfortunately, there's no quick-fix. Well, not yet anyway.

I used to have the same problem with sight while in the Astral.  Like Frank mentioned all you can really do is practice, it'll get easier as you progress.  Some people take longer to adjust and learn than others.

<br>
I agree with Noxerus, being too close to your body while projecting causes some weird side effects, visual being one of them.  You might try moving farther away from your physical body.
