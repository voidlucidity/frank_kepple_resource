Dear all:
<br>
<br>
We have a new pool on API. It's rather nice as you have the pyramid as a backdrop. Has been a bit of a rush to get it finished in time for the up and coming weekend, but the lads completed it as promised, lol.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

With sweet water! I love water! But wait a minute, I see another second piramid on the background behind the trees. Did you (order to) build that one too, Frank

What do you guys think he took a picture in the astrals and came back with it or something?  It's probly a picture that's similar to what the pool looks like.
