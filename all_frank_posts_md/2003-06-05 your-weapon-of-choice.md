Yes, I do step from the shadows of this board occasionly to post something.  Anyways...
<br>
<br>
I was just wondering what people's preferred weapon of choice is in the astral (and for those who haven't had a successful event yet, including me, what it WOULD be) and why?
<br>
<br>
For me, I always have been a bit of an odd person.  I think most people here would choose some type of sword.  I would choose: a Bo Staff.  I don't know why, it just "fits".
<br>
<br>
That and you can't really say you beat someone with a stick when you use a sword [

  There are a multiple amount of weapons I'd use, my personal favorite would probably be a samurai assassin's sword and something to throw, like throwing stars, a metal fan, throwing knives, darts.

I would personally use a samurai sword of some kind, but swords do get boring. Could you explain what a Bo Staff is? My weapon I guess could be that - just a staff or pole of some kind that I can beat the crap out of things with and also shoot energy with[|)]
<br>
<br>
But then again I have yet to have my first OBE. I can settle into a light trance most of my meditaton sessions now, I just can't go any deeper than that.

My favorate a staff.  Try enchanting a real weapon too, real helpful as you just have to pick it up rather then make an astral weapon each time.  My reason for a staff?  Simple, cause it exists in physical world too, I don't do as much damage to my room when in an astral battle [

I think I might use my feet or wings, to get outta there.  Or, maybe I'll just bare my breasts and while they're ogling I'll poke-em in the eyes.  Or I'll just moon them.
<br>
<br>
Honestly, what are you people doing on the lower Astral with all these armed, menacing lowlifes anyway?  "Oh gee! Let's go into a dark alley and get mugged!  It'll be fun!"  I got over THAT mentality by the time I was 20 . . .
<br>
<br>
Seriously, if ever truly faced with an Astral menace, I'll just tell it to "Talk to the Hand," and hold my hand up so as to bar its progress.  Then I'll ask my Astral Guide for help getting outta there.  Or just wake up.
<br>

<section>
Truly, you should look into weaponizing body parts, rather than concoct an imaginary sword or gun or whatever.  You could find yourself on the Astral in a bad situation (serves you right for being in the wrong neighborhood), and realize you forgot your sword, and then have to spend all this time jinning it up in your head, and wasting all that time while the Bad Guys do their damage.
<br>
<br>
It's so much easier to visualize your own body putting out deadly force.  Not as romantic, I do understand, but so much more effective.  Keep the Weapons &amp; Armor fantasies to your gaming adventures!  And on the astral, you can shoot nuclear weapons out of your backside.  Then you can crack up laughing, and rise up out of the Lower Realms to do something interesting for a change.

The interesting thing about weapons is that they don't do a darn thing unless they meet up with something that provides resistance.  That's when you really see some action....SO....maybe the ultimate defense weapon is to be able to (at will) make yourself have no resistance at all.  That would be my strategy towards this whole astral warrior thing.

Dear Risu no Kairu,

<section>
Thinking about it a little more, the idea of having a weapon does perhaps seem a little pointless.
<br>
<br>
I was only just thinking about a couple of semi-lucid dreams I've had where I've been under attack - in one I was able to throw energy balls and lightning at my attackers, or TK manipulate heavy objects to throw at them. In another, I was being shot at, so I just thought "shield", and I couldn't be hit. I walked through the middle of a hail of bullets and nothing touched me. Sure they were just dreams that I had a level of control over, but I guess the same principal probably applies in the astral. Our minds, our imaginations are the most powerful weapons we have.
<br>
<br>
That is of course unless I meet Tisha in the astral and she thinks I might be some hostile entity so she bares her breasts at me, at which point my mind would probably shut down. [:O]
<br>
Damned effective weapon that one!!![B)][:I]

I wonder if Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses work in the astral??

Consciousness is immortal. You can only confused and crippled it by FEAR until its intelligence is like an idiot until it never able to progress consciouslly (which will lead to self- consciouness extinction). If I am evil, I will confused, misinformed and propagate fear among conscious beings in order to manipulate them. Sound evils.

   I like poles.  They have long reach, two hand compatible, and they're great blocking weapons. Only downside is mine's wooden, so a sword would slice right through it.  But it still looks cool.  Mines about 6.5 feet long, and I'm very good with it

Lol I got really annoyed in a dream a while back and decided that I was going to destroy the world (I was *very* angry!), but all I could muster were a few fireballs [}:)]. Kinda cool they just seemed to phase in and then phase out again, but looked impressive enough anyhow! I think that then I went "oooOOooh!!" and mostly forgot about my genocidal intentions!!
<br>
<br>
But anyway I think that in the astral I would have to go with something familiar so my mind wouldn't have to think about it too much. Got a wooden sword so thats a possibility - or perhaps a sniper/mp5/sawn off (waaay too much action quake 2!). I've had dreams about playing action....sometimes funky, sometimes highly disturbing....

"You see, my ex-husband used to describe me as a cross between Elvira and Martha Stewart. Frankly, he found the Martha Stewart aspect the more disturbing of the two, even before her indictment, and before our divorce.
