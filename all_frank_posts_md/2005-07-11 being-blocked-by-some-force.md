Hi my name's Chris and as a new user I would like to make my first post.
<br>
<br>
I've been reading these boards for the past few months and I've been trying a few different techniques to project myself.
<br>
<br>
Whenever I attempt to do so (usually at night) I can hear and sense things around me but I cannot see anything but Purple and Yellow blotches of color in what I think are my eyelids.
<br>
<br>
Here's the thing :
<br>
I think someone or something is trying to stand in my path when I try to project.
<br>
<br>
Anybody have any experience with this?

I have, and haven't been able to overcome it. Been going on since 1987.

Hi:
<br>
<br>
The "restriction" as you call it, is just the normal difficulties people typically have when attemting something new. This is an art that takes some practice to perform with a degree of competency, and we all tend to get in the way of ourselves at first.
<br>
<br>
Feelings, sensations, seeing colours, hearing odd sounds, all that is very normal. From what you say you are touching on the Monroe focus 3 state. So you are obviously making some progress.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
<br>
Ill have to read up on this Monroe guy
<br>
Very popular name on these boards.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for replying to my post.
<br>
<br>
Ive been talking to my friend Anthony who projects and he said the color "blobs" I see in my eyelids will form into a spiral portal looking kinda thing as long as I don't try too hard or think too much.

I guess the colors could act as a good anchor for your waking mind to watch as you fall asleep, but i wouldnt attach any particular higher value to them.
