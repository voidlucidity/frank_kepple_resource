<section>
I've been trying of late to increase my awareness of Focus 27, and improve my navigation skills. To this end, I've been considering the possibility of doing what is generally called "retrieval work".
<br>
<br>
The idea behind this, is to try and contact "lost souls" who are trapped in emotional loops (and such like) on the lower planes and take them to the various reception centres in Focus 27.
<br>
<br>
My idea was to first do a retrieval with my guide Harath. Then follow him back to Focus 27. He could go and do his stuff, while I visited an F27 nightclub for an hour or two before going back to Physical.
<br>
<br>
Well, this is how it went:
<br>
<br>
(I pick it up from initial contact with Harath)
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Your boy is in good hands
</i>
[refers to the horse I lost]
<br>
<br>
I have a percept of a white stallion, only he kept the black mane. Yeah, that would be typical. And the lower half still flops left, and the upper flops right, what a blo*dy crazy horse. Thanks for letting me know. I might try and pay a visit sometime.
<br>
<br>
So what's on the cards today Harry boy, sorry, Harath?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 You sure you are up for it, Frankie?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Ah, so you *do* have a concept of revenge! Yeah, I'm up for it, but I'm not sure where I fit in.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Just use your imagination and go with the flow. Remember, I'll be in the background to give you some pointers.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Where are we going?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Just over there and down a bit.
</i>
<br>
<br>
What, er, how come we are already here?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Because you came direct to me, I didn't come to you. You're still not used to reaching out directly yet, are you. I suppose it will take a while after your years of going around and around beforehand.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Alright, cut the sarcasm: Mr. Almighty who only happens to have a million year advantage. Okay, so if you're so clever why do you need me?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Technically, I don't. But your radiation is more suited to the task in hand and it gives you experience.
</i>
<br>
<br>
What do you mean radiation? You don't seem to be radiating to me. Well, not any more than normal.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 That is because I tone it down, and you are getting more used to it.
</i>
<br>
<br>
So what's it like when you are fully switched on then?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 You really want to see?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Depends on whether I'll survive or not.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Let's save that for some other time. We have work to do, come, follow me.
</i>
<br>
<br>
It was like we travelled along a series of tunnels. I could have sworn we were underground somewhere. I couldn't see a thing as it was completely black so I hung on tight. After a short while we stopped.
<br>
<br>
Harath, where are you, I can't see a darned thing.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Be still, reach out to me and you'll sense where I am.
</i>
<br>
<br>
I'm confused, I sense something awful here. The atmosphere makes me want to puke. Where the heck are we? There's some kind of pressure like we're under the earth.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 If you really must know, it's a mass grave.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Ugh, you're not joking are you. You mean right now we're moving through heaps of rotting corpses. Yuk, that's disgusting. Couldn't you have found some damsel in distress we could rescue?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Shhh, we're almost at the spot. Feel that?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Hey, now you mention it, I do sense a kind of movement. There's something familiar but I can't get a fix on it. What do you reckon it is? Oh sh*t... Harath... something just wrapped itself around my legs. What do I do now?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Pick it up
</i>
<br>
<br>
What!!!
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Pick... It... Up
</i>
<br>
<br>
Okay, okay, if you insist.
<br>
<br>
As I reached down it became clear to me why the movement felt familiar. Taking hold of the object, I immediately recognised the form. It was human, probably no more that about 6 years of age. The body was trembling, using all it's strength to latch onto my legs.
<br>
<br>
I managed to unhook its arms and bring the body up to chest level and held it tight with both arms. At which point the body became absolutely still.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Right, let's go.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Hey, Harath, for once we are in total agreement.
<br>
<br>
We travelled back through the series of tunnels. Then there was a flash, and a feeling of acceleration like some afterburner just kicked in. Soon we came out of warp speed and began to slow.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly we came to a halt. Harath knew that I'd had enough and took the form. He held it to his heart, and the child was instantly shrouded in a golden light. Harath moved his hands away and, instinctively, I went to reach out thinking the child would fall. But the form remained close to him, suspended and bathed by the light.
<br>
<br>
That's quite a party trick you have there.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Speaking of parties, weren't you thinking of going someplace else?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Very funny, Harath, ha-ha-ha. Besides, there's no way they'd let me in looking like this and stinking of rotting flesh.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 You need to go back and get cleaned up
</i>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, cheers Harath. Got quite a few notes to make as well. Let's try something a bit more glamorous next time. What you say?
<br>
<br>

How did you learn about the "retrieval work", was it suggested to you by your guide ?

Thinking back to one of your earlier posts about navigation Frank....Could you have decided to quit what you were doing and pop into the RTZ to find out where you were ?

An awful thought about why the child was stuck there occurs to me after reading about the child stuck there. You don't supppose he/she was wasn't dead yet when they (whoever they were)....

What became of him/her after you left Harath?

G,day Frank
<br>
<br>
Very cool mate,however I believe you have probably done more retrievals than you think, which will come back to you.
<br>
<br>
Anyone not familiar with this word "retrievals" or the context in which it is applied, or are interested in doing retrievals yourself (you MUST have SOME control of OBE's allready) you will pretty much get the gist of it from Monroe's book  "Ultimate journey", or alternatively, Bruce Moens books have some excellent info on retrievals (he is a graduate of TMI &amp; does retrieval &amp; OBE workshops). You might also get some more info off his site.

What service Frank,
<br>
<br>
They say that the earth will also benefit when the poor souls in other dimensions are retrived.
<br>
This is crutial to our future.
<br>
I have  a friend who is a gateway of seven on earth, and this person processes souls, (many millions at once, makes her a bit sick) for another chance to reach to light.
<br>
Gives the words, 'only through flesh and blood' an added meaning.
<br>
Could we be links to that light?
<br>
Sweet Frank.

Bless you all

<section>
Thank you Frank, once again, for your posts.  I hope Harath gives you some time to get used to things before he takes you out again.
<br>
<br>
I have something to suggest to you, however, and it involves a bit of psychoanalyzing but please bear with me as I DO have a point:
<br>
<br>
You mentioned a sort of lack of sympathy for most adults caught in their emotional loops on the lower-Astral.  You are much more sympathetic towards the children - - which is quite understandable.  We've all survived childhood, and we can relate to the innocence of that state.  I don't think it coincidental, however,  that the first person Harath brought you to was a young child of about 6.  I don't remember if you brought this up once, or alluded to it, or if I'm just being presumptuous . . . but I think something truly awful happened to you when you were about six years old.  Am I right?
<br>
<br>
OK, on to my point.  There are millions of suffering children, probably, stuck in the lower-astral, and you could spend eternity focusing on their retrieval.  But I don't think that's what Harath has in mind for you.  I think he's just getting you started with the kinds of beings that you have the most sympathy for . . . children . . . and then one day you will move on to the others.  Because, when you think about it . . . infant, six, twelve, forty-six, or eighty . . . we're all children, really.
<br>
<br>
I have a friend who has taken the Tamelin Oath.  "Tamelin" is a celtic term for one who pledges to stay behind to do soul retrievals until the last soul on earth is freed.  That's a pretty huge committment . . . one I don't think I could take on, but then again, maybe I could.  The temptation to hang out at that nightclub in Focus 27 might be  tempting . . . but then again,  it could get mighty dull after awhile
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank, once again.

<section>
<br>
<br>
Tisha, I had quite a tumultuous upbringing (by today's standards) but nothing spectacular happened. My childhood was all a bit more of the same.
<br>
<br>
Basically, I was born into an ordinary working-class family. My father was fairly aggressive, but he was fighting to survive. In any event, It wasn't just him as that's how things were.
<br>
<br>
The way I see it has nothing whatever to do with any kind of sympathy. To me, it's simply a question of responsibility. It's not me that gets these adults trapped in emotional loops: they do. I'm not responsible for that. However, fortunately for them, there are plenty of others who hold a different view.
<br>
<br>
But with the children, my logic has a major flaw: a child cannot be held responsible. As such, I feel a sense of common responsibility hence the wanting to do something about these situations in particular.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Could you be retrieving souls and not know it?Does it have to be a conscious decision?Not sure if I would be able to do that sort of

wouldnt be easy for me to  see anyone trapped in a loop.

<br>
I dont really believe that it can be anyones fault they are stuck,I guess certain circumstances maybe.But even than,I still think its way too harsh.I see  lost souls  on the physical.And you can not even get through to them here.Cant  imagine how much harder it is on the astral.

Alpha, if you could maybe get a grip on the projection side of things I think you'd be a perfect help on the Astral. Yes, you are quite correct (and I readily admit) that I'm way too harsh to be of any general help. But you have *so* much empathy within you that you could put to good use.

<section>
The Tamelin Oath sounds like the Bodhisattva vow. It is nice to read of the same thing in a different culture than I am accustomed to. The Bodhisattva vow is a bit more extensive, though, because instead of just the earth it is all of samsara which is to be emptied out. 6 realms, many planets. Still, I think that the Tamelin Oath means the same thing.

Didnt say you,yourself are  harsh Frank ,meant that the way things are now,its incredibly hard to escape.(either way I really do not think you are)I just finished reading Monroes 2nd

gave me more of an idea.What its like in  those lower realms.
<br>
<br>
I can understand why you feel the way you do about the older ones.Sometimes I do feel  its there own dam fault also.But than I remember the way I use to be.I could have easily became a lost soul myself.That makes me think twice about them.
<br>
<br>
So if I get the chance.I will save  some souls here and there,that is if I am

  Though it may be true that you don't think you'd be able to help or could be of any help just the fact that you have thought of wanting to help shows that you would be able to if you ever tried. It is not the most powerful, the most special, the most intelligent or the most popular people who are the heros and make all the differences in the world. Just the little people, doing the small things, wanting to do the little things like talking to someone, picking up a peice of litter, helping someone reach a book, even just smiling at someone, could make all the difference in this world and you should remember that just thinking that you wanted to help and trying it one day, sending out good emotions and vibrations, could save a soul.

  Thank you for sharing that story Frank, I hope that in the future you want to do other things as well.

  You yearn for something you do not know, search for something just beyond your thoughts, long to return to a land you've never been to, and need something you've never heard of. Knowledge will fill that gap, as soon as you realize that knowledge comes after emotion and you need both to lay the foundations of your world.
