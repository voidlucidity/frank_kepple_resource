Hi,
<br>
In regards to the ego being that which is "I", what is that which is "Me"? are they the same i.e both are empty of inherent existance. For when one says "me" or "mine" it seems to be a possesser of emptyness. Do you see the point.

Your hair falls out, you clip your finger nails, dead skin cells get washed off, you eat, you pee, you crap. Chop yourself into a million pieces then find yourself.

"Me" and "Mine" would be the Ego.
<br>
<br>
"I" is the what you are.
<br>
<br>
The ego is empty of inherent existence, as it is one of the characterisitics of being incarnate in the human body, while the I (Soul) is existant, being that it is you, the real Experiencer that has existed for many billions of years.
<br>
<br>
Is this any help ?

I would call it "consciousness".

Thanks. It does make sense. Buddhism isn't an easy thing to study without having a teacher to direct questions to.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
There are two basic ego constructs, which one are you talking about?
<br>
<br>
Inner or outer?
<br>

Er, inner and outer.
<br>
<br>
I was wondering which one the original poster was thinking about.

<section>
the inner construct. that which is referred to as I and ME. Are these both empty constructs? The premise seems to be that where there is ME there is YOU but that tends to indicate seperateness and duality which seem to be the delusions that need to be overcome.
