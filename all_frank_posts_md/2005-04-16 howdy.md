Howdy people,
<br>
<br>
Stumbled across this forum from a post in a different forum of a completely different nature. I had a read through a lot of the FAQ's and I must say its really perked up my interest in all things astral again. I especially enjoyed reading the phasing FAQ.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I was really interested in OBE's and AP's about 3 years ago, I attempted it on many occasions, but I only ever reached various symptoms associated with pre-projecting (such as various paralysations -sp??).
<br>
<br>
However, hopefully with this new found interest I'll be able to give it a better go. 3 years ago I probably wasn't mentally at the right place to be getting into it, however, things are a lot more on track now and I feel as though psychologically I will be able to keep a sound mind when journeying in the astral.
<br>
<br>
Hope to get to know some people here and discuss some techniques and experiences and I'd love to meet forum members somewhere *out there*.
