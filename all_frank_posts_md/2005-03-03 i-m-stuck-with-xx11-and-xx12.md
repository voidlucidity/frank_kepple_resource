<section>
Its been more than 4 years now. Still I'm puzzled.
<br>
A brief history:
<br>
<u>
 Chance:
</u>
At first when it started, I barely noticed it. Most often knocked it off as a matter of chance. And forgot.
<br>
<u>
 Curious:
</u>
The frequency of its occurrence grew beyond a statistical chance, and I was curious, still never took it seriously.
<br>
<u>
 Amazed:
</u>
It was amazing as I somehow knew the time subconsciously only, never intensionally looked at my watch when this happened. Started noting its peculiarities.
<br>
<u>
 Worried:
</u>
It didn't go away, once I was worried...I'm going insane, perhaps some weird sort of OCD gripped me. I made all clocks/watches of my house randomly faster or slower by a few minutes. (I still keep my PC clock 1 hr+some random mins faster). It seemed to vanish.
<br>
<u>
 Irritated:
</u>
No, it came back fast. I thought of a presence which reminds me somehow (scary when you are alone in night...). Tried to get rid of it, couldn't ask for help, as I thought they would laugh at me. Irritation followed.
<br>
<u>
 Discovery:
</u>
By chance(?), I found a similar experience posted by someone on Usenet. Much relief and amazement. Later found 1000's of accounts....that shared same story. No scientific cause found, mostly new-age-ish BS.
<br>
<u>
 Connection:
</u>
But I found a connection (roughly suggested by the BS
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
), it started almost at the same time I started learning about spiritual things.
<br>
<br>
The puzzle is getting deeper and darker, on some days it happens almost every hour !!.... No exaggerations here....
<br>
<br>
Can anyone throw some light here? Why XX:11 or XX:12 ....?Thanks

X being the the Roman numeral for 10, X+X is how 20 was written. Events leading up to 2012 Â make it a common, but prophetically important, date.

By XX I meant any number between 00 to 23.

No, the clocks are running as usual, nobody sets them.

As a general rule a person creates in their future what they concentrate upon in the Now. So if that's what you are concentrating upon then up it will come I guess.

Hello,
<br>
Of all the things on earth and heaven, why would I concentrate upon seeing a particular time ?
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
And moreover I never do it consciously, so no question of concentration.
<br>
In fact if I try to do it consciously(i.e. try to guess the time), its never xx:11 or xx:12.
<br>
Hope I got your point correctly.

This "reality" is usually, but not always, consistent with itsself. You might put a nickel in your pocket and pull out a dime (no magicians tricks!). It seems to happen more when you look for weird things, and not just because you notice them, because looking affects it. Regardless of why we think weird stuff happens, those are the facts. Often the bigger changes are harder to see than the smaller changes. Who in their right mind would see a building and believe they saw it not there an hour ago? I would, if I saw it!

 Atomic clocks are not radioactive. They do not rely on atomic decay. Rather, they have an oscillating mass and a spring, just like ordinary clocks.
 <br>
 <br>
 The big difference between a standard clock in your home and an atomic clock is that the oscillation in an atomic clock is between the nucleus of an atom and the surrounding electrons. This oscillation is not exactly a parallel to the balance wheel and hairspring of a clockwork watch, but the fact is that both use oscillations to keep track of passing time. The oscillation frequencies within the atom are determined by the mass of the nucleus and the gravity and electrostatic "spring" between the positive charge on the nucleus and the electron cloud surrounding it.

atomic clocks get frighteningly accurate. For example, NIST-7, a cesium clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is accurate to five parts in 10^15. This staggering precision works out to an error of about a billionth of a second per day. To put it another way, this clock will stay within one second of true time for 6 million years.

I beat u to it!
<br>
<br>
Thats theoretical, assuming the power to all the clocks is never interrupted.
<br>
<br>
How do you know some unknown SUBatomic force wont interfere?
<br>
<br>
I guess its more accurate because theres only a few things inside an atom, compared to a lot of things in a solar system.
<br>
<br>
Its accuracy doesnt "frighten" me, only surprise that they know the laws of physics (at this place in spacetime) so well.
<br>
<br>
Just because the time at that atom is measured very accurately doesnt mean it reflects the time in other places. Relativity and maybe other time bending effects exist.

<section>
There is a heirarchy of those atomic clocks all over the world, they are nuke-proof. Time is averaged out of all.
<br>
Even if something interferes, we'd come to know. The point is it should be consistent so that all clocks go slow or fast equally.
<br>
Even if you destroy all of them, we can just build a new one and start counting again. There is no 'base time.'

Anyway the topic has nothing to do with time.

<br>
xx:11 and xx:12 both happen 24 times a day each. Assuming random checks at the clock throughout the day, odds are 1:30 you will see one of these.
<br>
<br>
But your checks on the clock are not random. They seem to occur at 11 and 12 past the hour. So, what does this say? Of course, I'm not sure. But we can ask more questions.
<br>
<br>
What commonly happens at 11 and 12 past the hour? Things usually start on the hour - meetings, tv shows, appointments, etc. Why do we look at the clock? We are momentarily disinterested in whatever we are presently doing.
<br>
<br>
According to psychologists, the average attention span for teenagers and adults is between 13 and 14 minutes, with the rest of the population distributed normally on either side of the average. You, being between 11 and 13 minutes, are candidly close to the average.

Yes, but not exactly.

Its not the time, because I often keep my watches faster.

Its something to do with the numbers 11 and 12. My attention is drawn to them, without my knowing, whenever they are on the watch.

The odds of seeing any time on the watch are exactly the same when I look at the watch
<b>
 consciously
</b>
!. That's like - oh, let me see whats the time now. The reason can be anything...waiting for something, schedules, attention spans etc.
<br>
And the odds should be same when I happen to look at it just by chance, but they are much more (I need to record those now, to make sure)
<br>
There is an odd feeling too, that I cant describe.
<br>
<br>
Btw, attention span cant be the reason because even if my span is 11 min, it need not occur at xx:11 exactly, and stay locked on the multiples of 11 (22,33,44,55), Â and even if it gets locked for some reason, after 55, we get xx:06...
<br>
Actually my attention span must be like 30 sec or less

I am often seeing 11:11 on clocks. It doesn't seem to matter what i'm doing. I could be turning around to walk out of a room and notice the clock or the phone rings and after i put the phone down the clock says 11:11. I'll sometimes just happen to look down at the computer system tray to see whats running at it's showing 11:11. Â It's quite bizzarre.
<br>
<br>
I had a period of about 4 weeks where i was seeing it almost every day.
<br>
It freaked me out at the time and it was very close to 11th November so i took the day off and persuaded my girlfriend to do the same. Nothing happened though.

I had a look on google and some sites said that when you see 11:11 you are being listened to by angels or something ??

I did a search too, and here's what I found -

1. Its just an odd psychological delusion.

2. Those who see this are 'lightworkers'.
<br>
3. Those who see this belong to a non-physical group called 1111, it has 1111 members.
<br>
4. You are being given some sort of reminder.
<br>
5. It has something to do with 2012.
<br>
6. Its a genetic reminder that you set up before your birth in this body so that you know when the time is 'right'.
<br>
7. This is your guide telling you to start behaving.
