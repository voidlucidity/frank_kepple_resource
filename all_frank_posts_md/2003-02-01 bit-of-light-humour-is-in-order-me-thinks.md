Mr Bush, the President, was visiting a school in the USA. In the middle of a discussion relating to words and their meanings, the teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the class in the discussion of the word, "tragedy." So the illustrious leader promptly asked the class for an example of a "tragedy."
<br>
<br>
One little boy stands up and offers, "If my best friend next door was playing in the street and a car came along and ran him over, that would be a tragedy."
<br>
<br>
"No," said Bush, "that would be an ACCIDENT."
<br>
<br>
A little girl then raised her hand, saying: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone involved, that would be a tragedy."
<br>
<br>
"I'm afraid not," said the President, "that's what we would call a GREAT LOSS."
<br>
<br>
The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. President Bush searches the room.
<br>
<br>
"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"
<br>
<br>
Finally, at the very back of the room, a small boy raises his hand.
<br>
<br>
In a quiet voice he says, "If an American Air-Force plane, carrying Mr &amp; Mrs Bush, were struck by a missile and blown to bits by a terrorist like Osama bin Laden... that would be a tragedy."
<br>
<br>
"Fantastic!" Bush exclaimed, "that's right. And can you tell me WHY that would be a TRAGEDY?"
<br>
<br>
"Well," said the boy, "because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly would be no great loss."
<br>
