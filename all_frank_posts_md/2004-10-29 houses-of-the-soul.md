<section>
Hi all.
<br>
I wanted to recount my general OBE experience, because it has a reoccuring theme to it. Ive dubbed it "Houses of the Soul" mainly because this was something that stuck in my head everytime i would come to from an OBE.
<br>
<br>
First I want everyone to know that I consider myself a intermediate level projector. Its easy for me to project consciously and stay OBE, but I have issues with interpreting the experience and usually stay out of any kind of contact with people I meet in OBE. Something tells me that its time for that to change. I want to take an active role in my OBE, rather than just the 3rd person perspective. I want to help people in need of help, and I want to be able to communicate without the fear repercussions (my main reason for keeping out of contact with those i see).
<br>
<br>
So lets get to it....heres my usual event.....
<br>
<br>
After running my energy circuit and storing up some reserves, I slip right out of body. I proceed to the closest window and exit my house. Now what stands in front of me is dependant on where my physical is, meaning the outside of the house and neighborhood is usually the same. Then I stroll down the street looking for a house to enter. At this point, the similarities of the actual neighborhood and where I am OBE at stop.
<br>
Then I pick a house to enter, go up to the front door. I knock. Sometimes people will answer the door, other times not. Depends on the house im guessing. If someone answers the door, I usually ask to enter and have never been denied entry that I can remember. If no one answers I try to open the door and have a look around.
<br>
If i have entered the house at this point, I tend to become the observer (and oh the things ive seen....). I will look around the house, listening and watching. Sometimes, when I have let myself i will run into someone and try to explain myself (with varied results).  Usually, after I feel I have seen all to be seen, I will exit the house and continue down the street.
<br>
<br>
There have been three houses that I have returned to multiple times because the folks I have met there asked me to. These three are the only times I find I have engaged in a conversation with the people I had met.  In each case, they seem lonely and glad to have someone to talk to.
<br>
<br>
So, I ask you guys to think about this and respond with the direction you think I might take to become more a active participant in dealing with the people I meet in OBE.
<br>
<br>
thanks!

I see what you mean about having thoughts after reading about the retrieval!
<br>
<br>
Your experiences are fascinating.  I love the way you use front doors to enter the other worlds.  I have just started using our pictures on the walls to do the very same.
<br>
<br>
You are a very polite traveller as well - if it was me, I doubt I'd even knock on the doors, I'd simply go through them!
<br>
<br>
I can only talk for myself, but if I was in your astral shoes, I would begin interacting with other people, on a very low-key level, initially to "test" out the situation/person.  Perhaps ask them why they are there, or how long they have lived there, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>
As a start, I would go back to the three people who have asked you to revisit them.  These sound like people who might need your help in one way or another.
<br>
<br>
Ask them if they have family and whether they've seen their family recently.  While you are doing this, do what Frank suggested, about scanning them for information (I think this would be hard to describe how to do this - but I know that I would know what to do, having had many OBEs, so I guess you would know what to do too).
<br>
<br>
If you get the impression that they are "stuck" and need help moving on, request that a Helper, or Guide, joins you first.  If someone else turns up, then I'd continue the retrieval process.
<br>
<br>
Obviously, I am not fully qualified to talk much about this, having only done one myself (and even then I wasn't fully conscious), but if you do a search on this website for "retrievals", there are some informative posts by Frank and Ginny in the archives.
<br>
<br>
I can tell you that if you do go down this path, it will be a greatly rewarding one.  For me personally, I now feel that I have found what I was put on earth to do.
<br>
<br>
Good luck and let us know how you get on!
<br>

<section>
One of the three people I had interaction with was as follows...
<br>
<br>
I live in Tallahassee Florida, and at the time was staying in house that was built in the 1920's. For some reason, my OBE's in this house were very strong and easy to obtain using my personalized version of NEW.
<br>
I would go OBE, and drift out of my bedroom window. As I have said, the basic structures of my neighborhood were pretty much the same. Except the house across the street. The house that should have been there, a new build in a neighborhood full of old houses from the '20s, wasnt. Instead, I encounter an old single story house, and felt that it was the house that should be there.
<br>
I went to the front door, knocked, and got no response. I opened the door, went in and found a elderly lady sitting on a couch. She was frightened to see me, and this made me feel like I was intruding. As a response to the elderly lady's fears, a young lady (early 20's i say) entered from another room. She first went to comfort the older lady, and then realized I was there. She said this was her grandmother and she was her caretaker. I got the feeling the older lady was sufffering from Alzheimers.
<br>
This was interesting to me. The younger lady told me they were dead, and this was were they resided. I told her that I was still alive and was projecting from the house across the street. She believed me and we discussed what it was like for me to encountering people I had never met.
<br>
Over a period of a year, I would visit the women across the street, having that feeling of never really knowing what to say to them. I sensed a strong bond between the two, but the granddaughter was sad she had to protect her grandmother and couldnt go on with the things she wanted for herself. But, she enjoyed my visits and the reprieve it provided her for caretaking after her grandmother, who eventually realized that I wasnt a threat and paid me no attention.
<br>
<br>
Hindsight is 20/20 as they say, and after reading thru the boards and the idea of retrieval, I do think this is what is beckoning me. Heres my problem....
<br>
I cant get back to them. It seems that the areas of the astral I am visiting is dependant on the house from which I am projecting. I want desperately  to help these women, as they have helped me in solidfying my OBE experiences in my own mind, as I was relatively new when I was visiting them.
<br>
I think a guide could help me with this, but my guide is....shall we say....fickle. On the few times I have asked for guidence, the result has been one where I sense a few people discussing if they should provide guidence or not. Twice, this has been provided, and each time my guide came to me under the guise of my older brother who passed to somehow ease my tensions of dealing with the spiritual higher-ups. This is an inhernet knowledge of mine, always after the fact. Little inconsistencies point out that in fact it wasnt my brother, and this has made me leary to deal with a guide.
<br>
This is, what I think, a result of my own making. I hesistate to say this, but sometimes I have been mischevious on the other side. Nothing horrible, but sometimes my actions are a result of feeling above karma. Although I know better, i say to myself "hey its not 'real life'" and do things I would never do in the physical. Few and inbetween, for example...
<br>
<br>
I have come back to projecting recently, and found that there are four people in the house next door when I project. They are two women and two men. I projected out this week to find them sitting on their front porch drinking and just killing time. I found the women attractive and could not resist the urge to pinch their rear-end. This is something I would never do  to a real woman. Their reaction was one of surprise and laughter. Yet, when I came back to, I really blasted myself for letting this happen. Somehow, I just know its wrong.
<br>
<br>
anyway, im rambling i guess. my point is, how do i get back to those i might help? Once i do, I think im pretty sure I can help them with the methods described here on the boards.

<br>
The very fact that you've had the thought that you need to be in the house you projected from originally to get to them is not helping.
<br>
<br>
That small "back of the mind" thought might be blocking you.  A lot of people say that you only have to think of these people and you will be there, but from my experience, is doesn't always work.
<br>
<br>
I don't know how to overcome this, but I would suggest that you make it your intent in your day-to-day living that next time you are "out", you will meet them again.  Ingrain this into your mind so that even your subconscious knows it.
<br>
<br>
I've had another thought.  Perhaps someone else has already helped them, hence the reason you can't get there is because the house is no longer there.  That's a possibility that can't be ruled out.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't worry too much about doing "naughty" things in the astral.  I've done some stupid things in my time, not least letting a monkey have his wicked way with me (don't ask).  I think it's just part of the learning process.
<br>
<br>
Sorry I can't be more help.  Perhaps someone else might have more good ideas.
<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope you can get back to them, because you've gained their trust and have done most of the work already.
<br>

I've just had another thought.
<br>
<br>
When you next project, go to the original house you first projected from, and then continue from there?  It might work.

 <br>
 You asked someone to respond with the direction that you think you might take to becoming a more active participant in dealing with the people you meet. My first response would be for you to project direct to the astral rather than taking the RTZ route, as I feel it will be far less confusing for you. In Monroe terms, the place to be is Focus 27. Here you will find all manner of people who are open to you and can answer your questions, etc.
 <br>
 <br>
 My opinion is your thinking about interacting with people is spot on. You can project reliably, you got over the fear stage, so the next step is to start interacting with people who live non-physical and gain some extensive knowledge and experience. There are a number of ways you can do this.
 <br>
 <br>
 With me, I decided to start doing retrievals. I was a bit doubtful at first, mainly because I did not want to screw up and seriously affect someone's development. I did screw up a few times but was assured this was normal and had not hurt anyone's progress and so forth. Once it started coming together, I could not do enough of them. The work is just too gratifying for words, as Sarah has just discovered.
 <br>
 <br>
 But as gratifying as it may be, retrieval work is not for everyone.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am devoting a whole chapter of my up and coming book on the subject of retrievals, giving all the information a person needs together with a range of actual retrieval examples. But here I will attempt to give you the basics, and if there is anything I can answer further then please ask.
 <br>
 <br>
 You need to have a high degree of emotional control if you want to get involved with some of the more desperate cases. Problem is some people get themselves trapped in the most awful ways, particularly suicides. When you scan their energetic picture, it is normal to see a graphic account of the circumstances that led up to their separation. But the more horrific the circumstances a person is trapped in, the more satisfying it is to get them out of it. Particularly when it involves children.
 <br>
 <br>
 On the outset, I used to only deal with children but I have since softened my attitude.
 <br>
 <br>
 The very worst cases you will find are those trapped in the lower or near-earth realms of Focus 23 and 24. In Focus 25, you tend to get many religious types, for example, who in a technical sense are trapped by their belief status, but they do not actually see it that way. They are having fun with their particular god, in conjunction with everyone else who subscribed to the same dictum whilst physical. Now and again, you get people in these places whose intellect begins to question the overriding dogma and they get "cast out" and someone will pop along to reassure them that they are not going to hell (anyone cast out from a religious setup goes to hell as far as the people who remain there are concerned).
 <br>
 <br>
 You mention about being mischievous, well, I too love being mischievous whilst non-physical, and this ability comes in very handy particularly within Focus 25. Here you are free to be as mischievous as you like as it can often serve as an interrupt that opens a person's eyes to their true circumstances. There is a chap in F25, for example, who thinks he is John the Baptist and he regularly has a queue of people waiting to have their heads ducked under the water, and all that jazz. Every now and then, I will pop to see him. I arrive doing my best Jesus impression walking on the water of the river he keeps ducking people under. This causes quite a stir! I can often get the attention of at least the people queuing and a number of others besides. Around 30 people, maybe 40 people in all on a good day, will transition.
 <br>
 <br>
 These people are auto-relocated to Awareness and Information centres at F26 and F27 where non-physicals (NPs) will try to get through and inform them of their circumstances, whilst buffering their energetic picture. This gives the subject a period of time, a little breathing space if you like, where they can hopefully realise where they are in the general scheme of things. Your success-rate with bulk adult retrievals will never be 100%. If it is then great. But realistically if you can average 50% overall then you are doing well. Many subjects end up winking-out as their energetic signature becomes too incompatible for the area. This means they end up back in some belief-system territory again. So after a while you get your regulars, so to speak.
 <br>
 <br>
 You make many friends too. I often bump into people I rescued and it is nice to see them doing well rather than being stuck in some place. Lot's of people are setting themselves up in the New Exchange Territories. They discover old friends and make new ones, take up new hobbies and thoroughly enjoy themselves. Dead and proud of it, as I call them.
 <br>
 <br>
 So that is basically the bright side.
 <br>
 <br>
 At the bottom of the barrel, you have the hopeless and near hopeless cases that many people who do this kind of work simply cannot deal with. Note: You will be directed only towards those cases you stand a fair chance of having success with! That is, both for the subject of the retrieval and for yourself. Therefore, no one please worry they are suddenly going to find themselves placed in all manner of awful circumstances.
 <u>
  No, this simply will not happen
 </u>
 .
 <br>
 <br>
 Problem is, once a person begins exploring the near-earth realms they realise how millions of people throughout the ages have been sorely misguided as to the true nature of astral reality. At the root of all those "dark forces" these occultists attempt to invoke, for example, are groups of people who have been trapped within the lower realms for many hundreds of years, directly as a result of this on-going emotional game play.
 <br>
 <br>
 With all these kinds of hurtful scenarios, it would not be too bad if only the actual perpetrators suffered the consequences; after all, the perpetrators are just as trapped as the people they exploit. However, millions of innocent people of all ages have been caught up in this for centuries; having had their emotional and other vulnerabilities exploited by religions, occult groups, and all manner of gurus and individuals.
 <br>
 <br>
 On separation, these vulnerable people often enter the belief-system territories of the depraved factions who lured them there in the first place. Unfortunately, rather than being in a land of power and influence, as these people are typically promised, many end up being trapped and abused in horrific ways.
 <br>
 <br>
 Perhaps the most despicable example I came across was that of a boy, about 12 years of age, a suicide case. He jumped off a tall building so he could be with an occult master (or whatever it is they call themselves) living in the land of power and all that jazz. He had become involved in occultism via the internet and had been encouraged by some older boys who were part of the same group.
 <br>
 <br>
 The boy got there all right (or at least to some place like it) only to end up in his occult master's dungeon who would use this boy, along with a number of other boys and girls, for perverse sexual gratification. Well, suffice to say, getting those children out of there was one of my most heart-warming retrievals to date.
 <br>
 <br>
 But that's not all:
 <br>
 <br>
 Many children, throughout the ages, have been taught to use weapons and sent out to kill some enemy or other. Even today it happens. Their physical bodies often end up dying a gruesome, painful death. Many suffer atrocious burns from explosions and are mutilated in all kinds of horrifying ways. Significant numbers of these children are lost and alone, trapped by their fears within the gloomy grey depths of a place they simply call, The Deep.
 <br>
 <br>
 Here is where the torturous screaming of the thousands who are trapped, haunted by the pain of a ghastly separation, all becomes manifest. Never has humankind's inhumanity to itself ever been as graphically demonstrated as in this place. We enter in a group of five each time. Seldom are we successful. But when we are a big firework's display goes off in F27, so to speak.
 <br>
 <br>
 Anyhow, that's the other end of the scale.
 <br>
 <br>
 Most people who do this kind of work settle for retrieval types somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. People are needed at every level and
 <u>
  all
 </u>
 effort is welcomed as there is such a shortage of people.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are no big benefits involved in doing this kind of work. Just the satisfaction of helping others less fortunate. Plus you do get to meet and chat with many NPs (non-physicals) employed in all manner of tasks. So the information you can gather is way beyond what you would be able to do normally.
 <br>
 <br>
 In other words, you get around more because people show you places that you would perhaps never see as a "tourist". Plus, you end up at the stage where you have more NP friends than physical, which feels a bit weird at first!
 <br>

<section>
Thanks alot frank, very informative and eye opening.
<br>
Heres a breif account of something akin to the worse case scenrio...
<br>
<br>
I was staying with my mom at the time, she lives in a nice middle class suburb. I projected out and strolled through the neighborhood for awhile, and trying out the flying techinique RB details in Astral Dynamics. Thats when a certain house caught my attention.
<br>
And this is how it usually happens for me. Among many houses, there is one that my attention is drawn to. The song from Sesame Street "One of these things is doing there own thing, one of these things isnt the same" always rings thru my head when I see the particular house.
<br>
This house was very posh and large, in a neighborhood of modest middle size houses. Its size was very intriguing to me so I stepped around the back to get a better look. When i got to the back of the house, I noticed some kids playing in a swimming pool at the house next door. I asked the kids if they had anything to tell me, and they sorta just looked at me with sad eyes as if to say, "We know what you are about to do, and its not good."
<br>
I guess some others would have taken this as omen, but I just knew I had to enter the house. I walked in the back door into the kitchen and everything seemed alright. No one walking around, nothing amiss. I found the stair case and walked up stairs which opened on a large room. And there was the most horrific scene I believe I had ever witnessed.
<br>
Blood. Lots of it, everywhere. Blood on the walls, blood puddled on the floor, and somewhere someone was moaning. There was a table saw in the middle of the room, obviously the instrument of death. I bolted out back down the stair and out of the house. The kids next door were gone and they were all I wanted to see. The projection ended there.
<br>
3 years later and that image of the bloody room is burned in my head. I cant watch movies with excessive blood anymore, it completely freaks me out.
<br>
I journeyed that neighborhood for quite awhile during my stay at my mom's, but I never saw that house again.

<section>
Yes, that's typical of the kinds of horrific experiences you can come across in the depths of the lower realms. It was all very shocking to me too, at first. But I survived by concentrating on getting the subject out of the circumstances, rather than on the circumstances themselves.
<br>
<br>
As I say, never has humankind's inhumanity to itself ever been as graphically demonstrated as it is within the lower reaches of the astral.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, when some government or terrorist group decides to bomb some place or make war with another country; or someone else starts chopping someone up with a carving knife, and so forth, they don't realise the full extent of the misery they cause.
<br>
<br>
That's what people working in the non-physical have to deal with on a daily basis, i.e. the true aftermath of all the sick and twisted political gameplay together with heaps of other crud. That's why I would only rescue children at first, well, children and young suicides. Because to me they were innocent of it all.
<br>
<br>
There was a time when nothing would please me more than to come across someone suffering in a hell of their own making as a result of living a contorted and twisted life on the physical. But my thinking has now moved on, of course.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
