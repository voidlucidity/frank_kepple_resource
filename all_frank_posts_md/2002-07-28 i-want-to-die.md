Sorry people I know this is not a pleasant thing to talk about...
<p>
</p>
<p>
 I'm dumb and totally socially inept. Nobody likes me. I agree that people need to learn how to live their lives but honestly I can't take this anymore. I've had thoughts about killing myself since my early childhood.
</p>
<p>
 I found out about OBE some time ago but I've never had a full OBE so I have no idea what it's like on the other side. Have any of you had experience with people/souls who killed themselves?
</p>
<p>
 This is not a cry for help. I know what situaiton I'm in. So please... don't try to talk me out of it. In case you're worried I'm not going to kill myself anytime soon. I'm still trying to set this up so I can "leave" when things turn out really really bad in the future. I just like to know if you people have any experience or met with humans in the astral who have committed suicide.
</p>
<p>
 Any help is appreciated, thanks.

<br>
The real problem you are about to face, if you fulfill your wish to place your physical body in a state where it will no-longer function, is you will still be left with You at the end of the day. Problem is, you can't actually kill yourself.
<br>
<br>
It is highly likely, all that will happen is, you will find yourself in basically the same depressing circumstances on the Astral, as you are now on the physical: only more so, because you will almost certainly get locked in an ever worsening emotional spiral.
<br>
<br>
I have a regular guide who takes me around the lower planes and shows me some of the more interesting cases where people are locked in an emotional loop. Many of them can be quite entertaining and joyous to watch. But I have seen some truly awful suicide cases where people keep trying to mutilate themselves over and over again.
<br>
<br>
The reason why you find yourself in the circumstances you are in, is because of the powerful negative emotions you are releasing. Though I fully accept that you, yourself, may not see it that way.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck, anyway.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

<section>
Well said Frank.
<br>
Sorry Comus but thats one of the hard facts about accepting this greater view of the world.
<br>
I too once had thoughts of 'swinging from the rafters' due to the fact that I thought that my obe exit trauma was too much to deal with. (See: OBE fears affecting my health)
<br>
but I've learned to accept it as a challenge to overcome and I'm now almost excited about it!
<br>
Once you learn about the astral you will realise that as Frank says you will not escape your problems, they will just be magnified. You will be most likely caught up in an emotional loop. You may even end up becoming tied to an area of the real-time plane and constantly relive your negative experience,
<br>
do you want to become a 'ghost'?
<br>
I learned that everyone must deal with their problems and suicide doesnt help because you will STILL have to deal with the same situation on the astral, only I suspect it will be even harder.
<br>
It's just a hard fact of life I'm afraid.
<br>
You've stepped over the threshold now so you will realise that suicide is not the seemingly easy option that it once was, you won't 'escape' anything.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The time to deal with problems is NOW!
<br>
<br>
You've started talking about it which is the first step in the right direction.
<br>
It certainly helped me.
<br>

G,day Comus
<br>
<br>
Hmmmm, not good mate, but on the upside, there is better luck just around the corner. Frank is right about the suicides &amp; I have seen &amp; interacted with some myself. We talked about this sort of off topic in astral chat under "what dreams may come", as they have one possible version of where suicides go in that movie (not that I necessarily agree with it), I felt from what I had seen, it was a lot like the movie "the others", people from the past or present, engaged in depressing mundane activities, but generally the scope of the individuals beliefs restrict them from moving on with things &amp; casting off negative attitudes &amp; experiences.
<br>
<br>
You just sound a bit depressed, maybe a bit down on the luck or can't seem to win for losing, you are obviously not dumb as you can use a computer, type, spell &amp; write well, so you just have to start thinking positive &amp; think of your self as lucky &amp; expand your horizons, maybe get the out of the area your in.
<br>
<br>
I went through this phase when I was 15 &amp; I thought nothing could be closer to hell, but there are so many suffering 1000 times worse, &amp; later on in life those lessons learnt give you good life skills &amp; experiences to draw on later.
<br>
<br>
The things holding you back is what you need to gain more information on, learn about &amp; turn them from stubling blocks into stepping stones.

believe it or not, but this is a huge factor in life.  I was born, and lived in Sunny over 3/4 of my life.  Then I moved to depressing butt Portland, Oregon.  I don't know where you live, but in Portland, it Rains, and is Gray outside more then 80-85 Percent of the year.  This had a huge Psychological Effect on Me!  I turned into a Depressed Mess!  I won't go into detail, but I was at the "Bottom of the Barrell".  I got the hell outta there after my Girlfriend, and I broke up (another Depressing Situation).  I got back into the SunShine which Brigthtened My Life Dramatically.  I suffer from Seasonal Depression, thats what the man calls it anyway.  I don't function well during the winter months.  I change the lights in the house to the brightest I can get (100Watt)  Let Me know if there is AnyThing Brighter then this!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't mean to ramble too much, but believe me, things can turn around, and get better.  Hang in there!

Try meditation about once a week or whenever you need it. It's a good way to connect with higher more positive feelings, and you will eventually feel the love your guides have for you.

Hi Comus,
<br>
<br>
Yes, you can make choices here.  It's not a simple thing like waking up and deciding "i'm not going to be depressed!" But it can be done. Deciding to do one small thing that you think will make your future better. I can't add much to what has been written except to point out that making small choices (even though it takes a real effort) really will, over time, exemplify how much power and control you have.
<br>
<br>
One other thing. During my deepest depression (I considered taking my life) I realized that "I" existed separately from my feelings. It is very easy to get caught up in the idea of being intimately intertwined with one's feelings (and most times it is appropriate and good to be so.) But there is a space where you can step away from your feelings and recognize that although 'they' exist, 'you' also exist independantly of them. If you can find that space or a similar space, you might get a breather now and then.
<br>
<br>
Caffeine reduces the likelihood of trying to take one's life.  Prescription antidepressants are wonderful medications.
<br>
<br>
Finally, my episode with depression is what has opened me up to greater spiritual growth. I don't wish depression on anyone, it sucks big time. But I simply would not be projecting, or even living a proactive life had it not been for depression. I would instead be living a life of reacting to whatever was put in front of me. Your situation sounds more chronic, so my experience might not apply. But I hope you can find a way through your depression to a more fulfilling life.

ZPE: I had a roommate who used a special light (came with an umbrella to direct the light appropriately) for SAD. You might want to look into specially designed products like that. Also, time of day appears important for light therapy:

<section>
Thank you everyone for such good answers.  Depression runs in my family, my dad was hospitalized and on "suicide watch" when I was a teenager.  My sister and mom have been on meds.  I go thru the occasional "bout," but I know that if I do the following, it passes:
<br>
<br>
1) eat right, exercise, sleep
<br>
2) get a broader perspective (i.e., it's not All About Me)
<br>
3) pray/meditate
<br>
4) SUNSHINE !!!!!!
<br>
5) talk to people who care!
<br>
<br>
Folks, if it ever gets bad enough to want to end your life, SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY!    Sometimes the chemicals in your brain go out of whack and you need some intervention.  If you delay, you will end up in a downward spiral that is REALLY hard to get out of.  I'm not on meds for this, but I'm not a snob; sometimes meds are what it takes!!!!!  Even if it is temporary. Counseling helps too.  The whole point is to feel better FAST so you can make good choices for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Don't mess around with this!  Comus, I think Frank said it best.   Suicide is not an escape.  Please know that "Wherever You Go, There You Are."  You are stuck with your own soul for eternity, so you might as well learn to LOVE . . .

In a way, being depressed after physical death might be WORSE than life here on Earth, since in the otherworld there are no physical limitations to what kind of horrid little scenes you could create for yourself after physical death.  At least here on Earth, the trees are green, the skies are blue, the world is BEAUTIFUL no matter how bad you feel!

Thanks for all the good replies.
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Frank/Gandalf: I dont think Im a bad person. In fact I show more compassion for the sick than most of the people I know. Why would I end up in lower realms and try to kill myself again and again when I'm already dead in the Physical? The depression I have is a consequence of the problems I have in the Physical. Knowing that I'm dead I'm no longer pressured by the burden of "trying to survive". I think I will actually be happy and free.
</p>
<p>
 Mobius/ZPE: This is not a teen thing, Im an adult now and little has changed. I dont think the problem has to do with the area Im living in. Its true that there are others out there that are suffering more than me in other ways, but feeling bad is feeling bad. I dont think others can be used for comparison.
</p>
<p>
 Qball/alpha/Patty/Tisha: I think it is possible to make myself a little happier from within when I do things I enjoy. Although I may see things in a differently light around me, but ultimately the problem is still there. As Ive said, this is not a teen thing and Ive been seeing recurring patterns of the same problem. Its not like I havent tried to change, but the continual struggle really gets tiring. Im afraid seeing a therapist and taking anti-depressants is only a temporary solution just like doing little things I enjoy, and the problem will eventually come back.
</p>
<p>
 People say if I want to change and try to change things will change, but thats not the case for me. Its probably not within my ability. Im trying all the time, things dont change and I still have frequent suicidal thoughts. I hope things do change 10 or 20 years from now. It really makes me wonder what my life is all about when I have to suffer every minute of it. The only time Im truly happy was the time in my very early childhood.

Sometimes it is very difficult to change what is causing sadness or problems.
<br>
I do not believe we need hardship to grow spiritually. Actually I have seen hardships do just the opposite to people.
<br>
I still think you should try the rope technique even if it takes you a few months or longer to finally astral project.
<br>
There are techniques that can be used in the astral to cause certain changes in the physical world.

Comus
<br>
<br>
I know you said no one should try to talk you out of it, but it's really hard to see someone in a sad situation and not offer anything.
<br>
<br>
There's nothing you can do really? What is it that makes you sad? I mean, if you are uncomfortable talking about it that's fine, but there are very caring people here and if there is ANY chance something can happen to turn things around, it might be worth taking it.
<br>
<br>
I had a friend who was suicidal once and I suggested he join any kind of group he could, not just therapy groups. Karate class, dance classes, bartending school, sports team, any kind of club. Sometimes just being around people who are having fun and are passionate about what they do can be contagious. It worked for him. Just an idea. In the end it's your decision of course. Good luck.

Hey Comus
<br>
<br>
Mate, I know you are not a teenager anymore, I looked your profile up before I posted you &amp; noticed you are 20 years old &amp; age &amp; that was not what I was thinking about when I posted you.
<br>
<br>
There IS no age barrier when it comes to depression as Tisha could vouch for. I was just pointing out that I have been there myself &amp; many reading your post have themselves as well, but are either past it or still suffering &amp; so are interested in how you deal with this.
<br>
<br>
The temptation coming from my own experience is to somehow think YOU have all the answers, or should have, &amp; to admit that, to people around you is a hard thing to do. When you are in a state like this, it is also likely you will bite the hand that is trying to pull you out of the quicksand. I'm sure your family would not like to see you dead or to go like that, &amp; would want to know what they can do to help.
<br>
<br>
The reason I said "get out of the area you are in", is because you get stuck in a rut sometimes, &amp; your comfort zone (the area you live, the job you have, the people you mix with) becomes a straight jacket on you, not a place for comfort. I've heard people say "home is where you make it", that's fine for people who don't like change, but you are literally forced to stop &amp; examine what you are doing that is wrong &amp; admit to yourself that leaving the dead wood behind might be the thing to do that saves your life.
<br>
<br>
I have someone close to me that spent 2 weeks in hospital in the mental ward for suicide attempt, I was there the whole time &amp; I can tell you that seeing things from both sides now, I'm not sure which one is worse, having it happen to you, or watching someone you love dig their heels in &amp; refuse help because of pride &amp; fear of being labeled a loony. It's just not worth it, don't wait until that happens.
<br>
<br>
You are right about the taking tablets might be only a temporary solution, &amp; it should be treated like that, you wouldn't want to be on them long term anyway, but they are definately a helping hand &amp; will give you the positive frame of mind you need to better combat your situation.

All the best mate

Hey Comus.
<br>
<br>
Having a tube shoved up your nose, pushed all the way down to your stomach pumping out a bottles worth of rubbing Alcohol that I chose to drink is no Teen Thing.  Sleeping for 3 1/2 Days due to my 30 odd Sleeping Pills that I Ingested is No Teen Thing.  I was 21 at the time I did this to MySelf, a Year Older then what you are Going through Now.  I speak from My Personal Expirience.  I know EXACTLY what you are talking about.  I was sharing with you what helped me out the most.  I sent 5 summers back to back because I Hate Winter Time.  I have traveled from Los Angeles, to Australia to Stay in Summer.  I've done this since 2000.  I hate Winter!  I've had an Episode of Depression just recently.  I haven't been this depressed in Years, but being winter here, the Cloudly Gloominess has gotten to me.  But, I managed.  Now its not NEARLY as bad as what it was when I was 21, but the Point Being is You can get through it.  Aside from being Winter Time, and gloomy SomeTimes, I'm the Happiest I have ever been in My Life.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest doing something that you Love.  I would also suggest, (I know its hard, and tiring) but just keep on reminding yourself, that You Will Get Over it, and make it through.  Thats what I do, and while somedays are hard, I always make it through it.
<br>
<br>
You Will Be Ok....

Thanks for the kind posts.

<p>
 Qball: Thats what Ive been wondering, but I guess life has its lessons through hardships.
</p>
<p>
 Atlas: There's a chance that things can change. Thats the only reason Im still giving it time to change, but the chance diminishes, as I grow older day after day. I can picture the day when the effort is not worth it anymore and I will just have to give up. I'm in a constant race against time. What makes me so sad? Long story short... there are many things that I like to do but I'm not able to, because I'm dumb and socially inept. People around me can tell my weakness. They either make me feel like crap or try to take advantage of the situation. I will be alone for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
 Mobius: I don't have any effective ways to deal with it. I just sit there for day(s) or do things to distract myself, but I know the problem is still there. For the ones that truly care, theyll just feel as helpless as I am. I dont want to give them problems they cannot solve. I wish I could get out of the area Im in, however I have to take care of my Mom and grandmother. They dont want me to leave them alone. This is also my other problem.
</p>
<p>
 Windameir/ZPE: For me it can happen anytime, and especially in the holidays. This is not my first time feeling suicidal, it only gets worse.

  Frank/Gandalf: I don't think I'm a bad person. In fact I show more compassion for the sick than most of the people I know. Why would I end up in lower realms and try to kill myself again and again when I'm already dead in the Physical? The depression I have is a consequence of the problems I have in the Physical. Knowing that I'm dead I'm no longer pressured by the burden of "trying to survive". I think I will actually be happy and free.

I never said you were a bad person. Though, on the other hand, I'm not sure whether having compassion for the sick, in itself, would necessarily mean a person was all light and good.

<br>
<br>
Perhaps, you are relating the lower planes exclusively with bad and evil?
<br>
<br>
If so, that is not the case at all. There are some very happy and joyous inhabitants of these planes. Problem is, you can get caught in a very happy and joyous emotional loop. But it's still an emotional loop and you are still just as trapped, i.e. your Spirit is going nowhere development-wise.
<br>
<br>
You say, "....... when I'm already dead in the Physical."
<br>
<br>
Problem is, as I said to you originally, what you are calling "I" (what I term the You of you) doesn't die! That is why I cannot, for the life of me, understand why you would wish to get rid of your physical body.
<br>
<br>
Okay, I fully accept you don't see it this way. But, believe me, your physical body is the best hope you have right now. It's the only solid protection you have shielding you from
<i>
 directly
</i>
and
<i>
 instantly
</i>
experiencing the
<i>
 full-blown effects
</i>
of the negative emotions you are releasing!
<br>
<br>
If you do away with that body, You (meaning your whole collective sense of conscious awareness, together with all the highly-charged emotional baggage you are currently carrying) will
<i>
 automatically
</i>
and
<i>
 instantly
</i>
be transported directly to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Frankly, and please excuse me for being so direct, at your current level of Spirit development you won't stand a cat in hell's chance of remaining "free" of anything.
<br>
<br>
It is highly likely you will (again?) become trapped in a negative downward spiral of the like I strongly suspect you have been trapped in before, and for a very long period of time. THIS is the CAUSE of your current problems. The legacy from which is what you feel within you.
<br>
<br>
It has nothing whatever to do with your current Physical circumstances. Your current Physical circumstances are merely a reflection of this.
<br>
<br>
Somehow, by the skin of your Astral teeth, you managed to get out of that spiral. Thus enabling your Spirit, i.e. the You of you, to continue to grow. I very much doubt you would have done that all by yourself. Someone (a higher being who will have experienced much the same in their own Spirit development) will have helped you come out of it.
<br>
<br>
They will be watching over you right now, praying for you and hoping that you will turn around and realise the emotion-fuelled loop you are in. Just like you realised the time before when they rescued you on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Now you have been given a golden chance, and have been put on this Physical plane in order that you can best deal with the emotional load that keeps arresting your Spirit development.
<u>
 It's the very best chance you have of finally breaking the loop
</u>
. So don't blow it, use it to your advantage.
<br>
<br>
Oh well, best of luck and all that.

<section>
Comus, Frank is right.
<br>
<br>
Contrary to what you are thinking, the situation you find yourself in today is not peculiar to your life on earth right now.  So killing yourself won't free you from it!   The emotional/spiritual set of circumstances that led to your present unhappiness will follow you.   Eastern religions call it Karma.
<br>
<br>
We in the west tend to simplify the concept of Karma and thus tend not to understand it too well.  Karma is a very Wholistic kind of thing - - - it encompasses not only this life but all of them . . . including your time in the Astral.  Even something "worldly" like physical pain has a spiritual/karmic connection.  Not that anyone "deserves" to suffer in a punishing way . . . . . . . it's more like logical consequences.  Karma is pretty neutral . . . and many of us suffer from it . . . so we should all feel blessed that we have "god," ancestors, angels, and/or other spirits who (for some weird reason) LOVE US and want to see us develop spiritually.
<br>
<br>
People struggle to understand the meaning of it all.   I know I sure did, for many years!   I've decided that it is best to see life on Earth as a training ground.  Karma causes all sorts of interesting life situations to bubble up to the surface.  To use volleyball metaphor, sometimes it's a volley, sometimes it is a spike.  The question is what are you going to do about it, especially if you are NOT ALLOWED TO END THE GAME?

<section>
I am sorry that you are in such an emotional state. Realize that you are not the only one that has ever felt this way. I think this is something that we all go through. The teens and early twenties seem to be when this happens most often. There are lots of things that I would like to do, but may never get to. That is just life, you cannot have everything. You really need to stop looking at what you do not have and look at what you do have. Until you do you will never be happy. Think about some very materialistic person you know. All they want is more things, they are never happy with what they have. They keep thinking that when they get something new they will be happy and complete. The problem is they are looking outward for happiness. As soon as they get that something it is then theirs. Since they do not look at what they have, only what they do not have it does not make them happy. The same goes for all things, emotions, and people. As long as you are looking at what you do not have or cannot do you will always be depressed, for no one can do all things, posses all things, or do everything that they want. But if you look at what you do have, then you stop seeing yourself as incomplete and hollow and instead see the things that make you complete. I hope this makes sense. I have been through depression, so I know how you feel. I also know that unless you want to be happy and get out of it you never will. Learn from you experiences and learn to enjoy them.
<br>
<br>
One way to help you better see what Frank is talking about, see life as a video game. When you play a video game you are "in a different world" having experiences. But all games end. When the game is over you are still you, just in a different enviroment. When your physical life is over you will still be you, just a different enviroment. The problem is this new enviroment is very thought and emotional responsive. So you will still have to deal with how you feel, only much more directly. Your emotions will shape your enviroment. So through suicide all you are escaping is the physical world. The best possible thing that you can do is learn to deal with the situation otherwise you might get caught in an emotional loop until you do deal with it. Much easier to deal with on this plane than the other where you most likely would not get  a break from it.

Hi Again,
<br>
<br>
I wanted only to comment about the medication. First of all, I should say that different people respond differently to medication, and if you do decide to get some antidepressants your doctor may need to try different dosages or kinds.
<br>
<br>
Second of all, sometimes the medication is not just a short term fix. In some cases, getting the seratonin levels at the right place will kick the system into regulating itself properly again, and you can wean off. (Every case is probably different.)
<br>
<br>
I have had stomach problems in the past, and I really resisted taking medication. I thought that I could beat the ulcers through diet, exercise, whatever. And I didn't want to be dependant on antacids to feel right.  But the thing is, taking the acid - blocker allowed my stomach to heal to the point where it could keep itself healthy on its own.   So when I finally took the medicine, I found that it got my system running properly again and after a few months I didn't need them any more.
<br>
<br>
Please don't be offended that I am comparing ulcers to depression. As I mentioned before, I have been suicidal. I know that depression is 100 times worse.  But I also hear you saying that you don't want to use a drug ---- and I am trying to offer what experience I have to help you see another possibility ---- That maybe it wouldn't be a long term prescription.
<br>
<br>
((((Comus))))
<br>
<br>
You know, even though I don't have depression now, I still see a therapist. It is good. It helps me realize that people help one another.
<br>
<br>
I hope you are having a good day. Keep at it. I'll check back on the thread regularly.
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>
<br>
<br>

i recommend you all to read the book of michael newton destiny of souls

 //www.geocities.com/josemiguelmazo/destinyofsouls1.html
</a>
it deals with cases of regressions to the life between lives and gives explanations about what is the life like in the spiritual world. some of you have  said that if you commit suicide you get trapped in the astral zone, with negative feelings and remorses. i dont think this is necessarily true. in the newton s books come out cases of spirits who commited suicide in their prior lives and they were healed when they arrived to the spiritual world.
<br>
the books of bruce lack explanations of this kind, about what happen when you pass to the higher realms, to the real home of the souls.
<br>
in my opinion when you pass by a life of real suffering its because your soul has accepted this lesson and its written in your destiny. its part of the evolutive process of the soul, and later or sooner all the souls have to pass by it. to read the books of newton can be a help, because they give hope and understanding.

I have also read that when a person commits suicide their spirit is healed when they arrive in one of the spirit dimensions. I would tend to believe this to be true since angels and other good spirits have unlimited love for humans.

comus: have you tried praying? i am in a constant state of depression from having to live in this world too, and there have been times when i told God bluntly that unless he did something (and i was specific each time) by a certain time, then i would kill myself because it would be easier that way. and yet, i am still alive today (but be warned that each time i did this, it was only at or near the very end of the time limit that it happened).
<br>
<br>
and don't worry if you think you are dumb and socially inept. i was socially inept in high school and it was only during the past year that i really gained any social skills at all (but i'm still alone). and if you think you are dumb, start reading stuff; fiction, science, magazines about the world: everything. you will learn lots from books.
<br>
<br>
and i especially recommend the dragonlance series that follows the group that includes Tanis Halfelven, the brothers Majere, the kender Tasslehoff, the dwarf Flint, Kitiara, and Sturm (or was it strum?). they are really good books that give you a lot to think about and lots of ideas about life. try them

Alpha: Don't know if I'm really empathetic, but I have few of those traits such as "easily influenced by others" and "introvert".
<p>
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 Frank/Tisha: The obe materials I've read usually relate lower realms to negative entities and activities. Not saying I'm all light and good but to my understanding I think having compassion is better than no compassion or taking advantage of the sick. So I tend to relate the latter to lower realms.
</p>
<p>
 I agree with the the recurring problems that we must deal with before they go away. In the Astral, if I become trapped again in a negative downward spiral of the like I have been trapped in before, how do I get out of it?
</p>
<p>
 If someone with negative emotions and immature spiritual development like me got killed in an accident will he be doomed to a negative downward spiral till eternity? What happens to people like that if the death is an accident? Is there a difference?
</p>
<p>
 I partly agree that the Physical world is a reflection of my perception/soul, but how are things like Physical pain a reflection of it? It only makes sense if it's explained with Karmic principles. Say a 75 year old man only has 6 more months to live due to some painful illness. Some people may think suffering the 6 months of constant pain isn't necessary. Is there any part that is purely Physical but not a reflection?
</p>

 When was I rescued on the Astral?

 fallnangel77: True, but the lack of something (not necessary mateirals objects) is usually the reason people look at me differently.
</p>
<p>
 Is there a reason why it is easier to deal with problems on this plane? Why are things "designed" this way? I believe in OBE and life after death, but I think half of the people who killed themselves in the past year do not know or believe in these things. What happens to these people?
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 Patty: I don't even know where to start with meds. and threapy. I have a feeling that some (or most?) threapist are closed minded people who won't understand my problems. I'm afraid I would be diagnosed as having some mental illness that I don't have.

The physical body has a powerful stabilizing influence. When I am lucid in dreams, even when I don't want to do things the actions are carried out. When I choose to do things there is enormous resistance. My mind is out of control even after I discover that it is a dream. It does not matter that it is just a dream and that the power is mine to influence it. I cannot use my ability.

<section>
Comus, to answer your question to Patty (just in case she takes awhile to visit this thread):
<br>
<br>
The place to begin with meds is your regular family doctor. He or she will not think you are crazy.  Don't make an appointment for X weeks from now; rather, tell the receptionist that you need to be seen NOW.   Just say that you are depressed and are having thoughts about killing yourself, and that you need some immediate guidance.  After asking you a few questions he/she will take immediate action to make sure you see a social worker or a psychiatrist, pronto.
<br>
<br>
It will probably be a specialist he/she knows and trusts.  This is a much safer route than looking in the phone book.  If the office is having its own crisis (hey, it happens!), they might send you right to the emergency room.  You don't need to be bleeding to be seen there, just walk in and let the nurse know the deal.  Psychiatrists are on call to emergency rooms for exactly this reason.
<br>
<br>
Psychiatrists know when people are "depressed" and when they are "crazy."  That's what they went to school for!   So don't worry . . .  although every individual is special in their own special way, when push comes to shove, psychiatrists have seen many people just like you.  And they will know exactly what to do.
<br>
<br>
let us know how it goes,

<section>
oooh yeah you asked other questions.  A lot of them can be answered, in general by the following:
<br>
<br>
Have you read Robert Monroe's book, Ultimate Journey?   It will answer a lot of your questions.  During his OBE experience he had met several people who were recently deceased from the Earth.  All very unique.
<br>
<br>
Frank has also had occasion to witness several individuals locked in their eternal "loops."  He's written about some already . . . perhaps some night soon, when Frank has nothing better to do, he can start a NEW post titled "Postcards from the Lower Realms" or something like that.
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_big.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_big.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
About the "lower" realms:  "Lower" does not mean evil.   That's just Christian theology clouding the matter.  Even New-Agers drag the good/evil dichotomy with them into their so-called "new" way of thinking about things.  But to REALLY get beyond your indoctrination you have to realize that  "Lower" and "higher" are hypothetical constructs.  In the Universe, there is no up or down.
<br>
<br>
(By the way, the Lower Realms were widely acknowledged in many ancient religions as rather dank, depressing cold spaces, but they were not evil.  Everyone went there before being reborn.)
<br>
<br>
As for the Truth, we'll probably have to visit There ourselves to know for sure!
<br>
<br>
So how do people in the Astral get out of their unending loops of psychic activity?  As Frank mentioned, they are RESCUED by kind souls who are more with-it than we are.   Many of us have probably been rescued at some time or another.
<br>
<br>
My boyfriend says he wants to die having an orgasm.  I for one would not appreciate this at ALL, but he likes the idea of spending eternity that way.  But even THAT would get freaky after awhile, don't you think?  I wouldn't want to be that way.  Rather I want to be like the ancient sorcerers:  walking straight into the Astral, wide awake, totally aware and in control. No pain, no suffering caused by illness or injury. That is how the sorcerers "cheat death."  They would never do it by taking their own lives.
<br>
<br>
tisha
<br>
PS:  I would promise to ask my Guide about what happens to suicide victims the next time I OBE . . . but I can't make that promise.  I've turned the lesson plan completely over to him/her, and she/he decides what to tell me.  But I will share whatever I remember with the Forum.

Hi Comus,
<br>
<br>
What I was 'missing' when I was depressed, was my child. I felt like I had lost a limb, (or a major internal organ) only no one could see it. I always thought that at least if people could see what it was that I had lost, (like if it had been a limb), that they would understand why I couldn't function. It sounds like you don't find that to be the case, that what is missing in your life is plain to see and that people still aren't compassionate or helpful.
<br>
<br>
You are helping me understand, and I wanted to say thank you. Also, here is another ((((hug)))).
<br>
<br>
Some therapists are spiritually trained. I think (can someone verify this or correct me?) that Jungian psychologists/therapists tend to help patients look for spiritual bases for their concerns.  In terms of the medications, Tisha knows more than I do from her family history and her advice sounds good. I would guess that if you keep those specifics that you don't wish to share, out of the picture, no one is going to think anything at all except to listen to your wish for medical help.
<br>
<br>
I don't know where in Canada you are - but here is a page with some contact info on Jungian psychologists (again, someone please straighten me out if I've got my information wrong, I think jungian analysts are trained to look at things from a spiritual perspective)
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.eskimo.com/~dcs/faq.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.eskimo.com/~dcs/faq.html
</a>
<br>
<br>
I also volunteer with hospice. We firmly believe that pain is not necessary during end-of-life situations, like the 75 year old man you used as an example.  We help by providing pain killers so he could have a fuller physical life until his body is truly done living. I personally believe that the decision to accept help to overcome pain can be a spiritual decision ---- it is no small potatoes to reach out for help. Perhaps that is the reason for pain, it gives us an opportunity to accept help from others. I don't know.
<br>
<br>
Finally - with regards to what existence is like while NOT on the physical plane. I am not terribly experienced, but from my limited experience I have developed great appreciation for the STABILITY and PREDICTABILITY of the physical plane. It is nice that it is so concrete. The physical world can really suck, but at least you have an idea of what to expect. I tend to think this is a place where we develop our consciousness into a form that can exist in the fluidity of non-physicality. Like, our physical construction houses our consciousness until it is developed enough to exist without a physical housing.

I read some astral projection books if you read projection of the astral body by sylvan muldoon (check out your local library they may have it) he stated what happens the moment one dies, he was talking about one guy he observed while in his astral body who was addicted to narcotics/alcohol and his life was upside down, he detailed described his aura was brown (which was bad) what happened when he was dying and being resusitated he was in his astral body then he went to grab his booze on the side which he couldn't then woke up then when he finally died he was in a really bad state and went franticly into oblivion once out.  If you can ignore how you feel and think and say to yourself those are not my thoughts and feelings, I know there is a God that created me that loves me and cares for me because he created me and I'm just a pilgrim here on earth then obviously there is no reason how bad things get to ever contemplate suicide, even love your enemies even though they look like they did you wrong visualize yourself hugging them and saying you forgive them.  There is some passive countermeasures you can try aromatherapy is amazing, try getting some helichrysum thats for claryfing, panic disorders, loniliness,anti-depressent, there are others ones that puts peace  one mentioned in robert's book is marjoram.   Read some psychology books dr. joseph murphy is good one power of your subconscious mind will give you reason enough not to even waste your time thinking about suicide or any negative thought (ie fear/anger etc..) and to only think about your desires and what you want to accomplish here on earth.

I can really relate. There's not a day goes by that I don't think about eating my 38 and I've had (only 2) OBE's. I agree that killing yourself isn't the answer or I would have done it years ago. In those years I've had days when I was really glad that I didn't do it, but looking back, the bad far outweigh the good.
<br>
<br>
But I really think that's all beside the point of it all. If you're going to just end it then what was the point in showing up in the first place? I like to say "if life was easy, everyone would be doing it". LOL
<br>
<br>
My Daughter (28yrs) is bi-polar and it has fallen to me, being the only person she will trust, to talk her down from her delusions. This has really taken it's tole on my own grasp of reality lately. She's convinced that she can read minds and it's her responsibility to 'save' mankind (just to give you a taste of what it's like). She comes home from work every day with a new scenario that she has cooked up from bits of overheard conversations and 'voices' that tell her what she should do. She's been under a Dr's care since 1997 and is taking more meds than I can believe. They seem to help a little but without my constant counceling, she goes off the deep end and does a complete shut down. It's really a heart-breaker to see your own Daughter going through something like this. I feel so helpless most of the time.
<br>
<br>
I  tell you this just to give you a sense of where I'm coming from when I say I think about it every day. But having had those two OBE's has taught me that when you go over, you remain EXACTLY who you are here. In my case my astral self was even wearing my watch.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
That being true, I can tell you that I would be in HELL if I killed myself, because I would want desparately to help my Daughter and would be unable to do so.
<br>
<br>
So I stay and take consolation in the fact that even the bad things in life eventually end on their own. Hang in there. If I can do it you can too.

<section>
Comus, the lower Astral planes generally reflect what you see on the Physical. In other words, you come across all kinds of good, bad, and everything inbetween.
<br>
<br>
When you speak of types of death, understand that it is not so much the actual death, or the cause of death that is important; but the emotional baggage or load the Spirit is carrying and/or releasing when the physical body expires.
<br>
<br>
Someone posed a question relating to this a short while ago: about what is the difference between an older person being kept alive on a machine; where that person agrees with the doctors that it's time to pull the plug; and a youngster, in a desperately screwed emotional state, who takes their own life. Because, technically, they are both "suicide" cases. To which I entirely agree.
<br>
<br>
However, the stark difference between the two circumstances becomes apparent when you consider the respective emotional load. And it's the emotional load that makes all the difference when it comes to assessing the likely route that person will take, when making the transition to the Astral upon physical-body death.
<br>
<br>
Now, when I say "Spirit" I'm not talking about some fuzzy mystical concept. Your Spirit consists of your collective sense of conscious awareness. That is to say, all your thoughts, memories, feelings, emotions, experiences, etc. all of which are contained in your Spirit body.
<br>
<br>
People often think that their thought processes are products of the workings of the physical brain. But such is not the case at all. The brain merely acts as an interface and is the "central processing unit" that controls the workings of the physical body.
<br>
<br>
Your Spirit body is held in alignment with your physical body by biomagnetic attraction and interfaces through multiple energy centres. And, as I say, it is where your collective sense of conscious awareness actually resides.
<br>
<br>
Which is why, if you place the physical body in a position where it will no-longer function, all that happens is your surroundings change. But the You of you, remains *exactly* the same.
<br>
<br>
This phenomenon is demonstrated in another way when projecting within the Astral. When you do so, you don't suddenly develop some super sense of Astral conscious awareness, fully primed and geared for Astral use. Nope, the collective sense of conscious awareness you take with you to the Astral is
<u>
 exactly the same
</u>
as you have with you on the physical.
<br>
<br>
Here lies the *major* stumbling block:
<br>
<br>
One of the trickiest things to accomplish, while on the Astral, is to learn to remain emotionally closed. The reason this is absolutely necessary is because you cannot make any kind of real progress unless you learn to do so. Understand that what we call "thought" is, in fact, a primary energy and how we "think" creates our basic circumstances.
<br>
<br>
This is as true on the Physical, as it is on the Astral. However, on the Physical, our physical bodies buffer our thoughts to a high degree. In other words, you can think about getting a beer from the fridge until the cows come home; but unless you actually get up off the couch, go to the kitchen and get one, you'll never get that beer.
<br>
<br>
On the Astral, merely think about having a beer, stir in a little emotion and, hey presto, you instantly find yourself in a pub, club (or wherever) having a cool beer. (And relishing it the same as you would on summers evening after a scorching hot day.)
<br>
<br>
You see, on the Astral, you can manifest anything and everything with your thoughts. Become fearful, for example, and *instantly* you will find yourself slap-bang in the middle of some fearful circumstance. For any release of emotion, when on the Astral, instantly creates your surroundings in glorious 3D Technicolour.
<br>
<br>
The BIG danger here, is that these emotion-fuelled circumstances that surround you on the Astral, look as "real" to you as any circumstance would look on the Physical. Which is why it is
<i>
 ever so easy
</i>
to get stuck in an emotion-fuelled loop or spiral.
<br>
<br>
People get caught in all kinds of loops while sleeping and dreaming on the Physical, or when projecting to the Astral. This is something I have done many, many times in the past when I was learning the basics. But such loops are easily broken by physical-body demands, like, hearing the alarm clock, or needing to go to the toilet. Or, if I would get caught in a really scary loop, my protective sense of conscious awareness would initiate a forced awakening back to the Physical.
<br>
<br>
However, without a physical body, no such breaks can possibly occur.
<br>
<br>
It is true to say (and one of the posters to this thread mentioned about it) as the Physical carcass dies, the Spirit can be met by friends, relatives, guides or other helpers, waiting on the Astral to assist them with the transition from Physical to Astral. Yes, this is absolutely true.
<br>
<br>
HOWEVER......
<br>
<br>
What good this does, all depends on the emotional load the Spirit is carrying and/or releasing at the time of death. Understand, it is *easily* possible to release a level of emotion to the extent where you block out the true-Astral completely.
<br>
<br>
In other words, you may well have other Astral residents, such as your Spirit Guide, around you trying to help.
<i>
 But you won't be able to see or hear them
</i>
. As you will be totally engrossed in your own emotional interplay.
<br>
<br>
I come across Astral residents like this all the time. They can be engaged in some repetitive task, or just aimlessly walking about, and when you look into their eyes all you see is that (by now) familiar glazed expression.
<br>
<br>
In fact, I very much doubt these people even realise their physical body has passed away. And that is the challenge these higher beings have. It's like you were in a coma. No-one can say when you will come out of it. All they can do is play your favourite music, make you smell your favourite food, have your wife hold your hand and talk to you softly, etc., etc. In the hope that deep within you, something they do that is familiar to you will trigger an awakening.
<br>
<br>
You were rescued on the Astral alright. Where do you think that compassion comes from. Trace it back to its source and you will find whoever it was that saved you. I think you owe them a beer.
<br>
<br>
As I say, best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
G,day Comus
<br>
<br>
To turn you way of thinking around, you need to think the opposite of what you are writing &amp; tell yourself, regardless of what people around me say, I'm worth it, I'm competent, I can do anything I focus my energy on.
<br>
<br>
If people around you tell you that you are incompetent, useless, inept, worthless &amp; you give credence to those words or somehow think their words &amp; thoughts have more value than your own, that is exactly what you will believe of yourself. What authority or right do they have, that they somehow know the real you &amp; can tell you what you are, when you know deep inside they are wrong. I'm just talking about basic social interactions here, not taking it to extremes e.g. Killing someone for no reason &amp; saying you are right in doing so, because that is what you believe is right.
<br>
<br>
Obviously (and you would allready know this I feel) you have to operate within the boundaries of the law.
<br>
<br>
It's amazing how many things we take for granted in life &amp; how we compare ourselves to others, or measure our success in terms of material possessions, qualifications or social standing. Whether you believe it or not, you are in the top 10% of all the people on this planet, as far as conditions of life goes. I assume you have shelter, protection from the weather, clean drinking water, sewerage, access to food, information etc. Then you come to what the majority of people on this planet would consider luxury goods ; a bed, free or cheap medical help, t.v, a computer, cars etc. all of which I assume you have had experience with.
<br>
<br>
If we plucked you out of Canada &amp; placed you amongst some peoples in Africa, India, some parts of Asia &amp; South America, they would think you were some sort of unatainable millionaire type person, who has experiences &amp; possessions beyond their wildest dreams. So thank the Gods of good fortune that you have been placed where you are, because as bad as you think things are, there are literally millions who would trade your life for theirs in a nanosecond.
<br>
<br>
Sooooo, to identify where you are going wrong or what you need to learn, you need to translate your thoughts e.g. I am useless at maths, science, english, talking to people, driving, music, work, wiping my butt ; Becomes I need to learn or read more on maths, science, english, talking to people, driving, wiping my butt etc. So you type those words into a search engine or go to a library &amp; gather some more info on areas you feel you are lacking in.
<br>
<br>
Also, try to be happy &amp; positive as much as possible, this will help your brain work more efficiently, get hold of some comedies or anything that makes you laugh, &amp; laugh recklessly, laugh at the world, yourself, your situation, you would be surprised at how well it works.
<br>
<br>
Take care mate, all the best, good luck &amp; good journeys, we are all cheering for you.

<br>
<br>
There have been times in the past when I felt sad, and there were the times when I felt joyous. However, nowadays, apart from the odd tinge of frustration and the occasional mild annoyance I manage to keep myself emotionally closed much of the time. Which is the same condition that you have to maintain if you are to make any real kind of sense of the Astral realms.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, you can only really "experience" emotions on the Physical. In the sense that a person might get angry, for example. If they are sensible, they will sit back in a comfy chair, relax and listen to some soothing music perhaps. As a result, an hour or so later, their mood changes and they could well find themselves brushing off the reason for their anger while laughing thinking of how petty they were, or whatever.
<br>
<br>
On the Astral, whatever emotional mix you release *instantly* and *literally* becomes your reality. In other words, there is no going to a quiet room to relax until the angry mood subsides (i.e. the emotional energy dissipates).
<br>
<br>
Say you released some fear (very common emotion to release on the Astral) you will instantly find yourself in fearful circumstances that will be as fearful to you, at the same level as you expected to be fearful. This is simply due to the fact that it is *your* release of emotion that is fuelling it.
<br>
<br>
What typically happens next, is the person gets even more fearful. Which naturally releases more emotional fuel; so the fearful circumstances get more intense; so they get more fearful; so the fearful circumstances get more intense; so they get more fearful; so the fearful circumstances get more..........
<br>
<br>
And there you have it, an ever worsening emotional spiral.
<br>
<br>
On the Physical, you can readily get out of this. Due to the fact the nightmare will increase to the point where the protective sense of conscious awareness will initiate a forced awakening back to the Physical. On the Astral, however, without a physical body, no such forced awakening is possible. In other words, the nightmare continues getting worse and there is nothing you can do about it.
<br>
<br>
That is again why it would be daft of you to dispose of your physical body at your current level of development. Keeping your physical body is basically the only real chance you have of putting things right.
<br>
<br>
Having a physical body means you can project to the Astral, seek out your guides, find out your history AND do it safely. Because whatever it is you face, no matter how horrid or ghastly, ultimately it cannot harm you.
<i>
 Because you can always zip back to the Physical in an instant
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
When I was learning the ground rules, I used to do this all the time. I'd naturally release a little fear and, try as I might, I couldn't close it off. First there were two of them, now there's a hundred and they are all chasing me holding weapons. Then I think I'm trapped and instantly I am surrounded. Aaagh I lost it again, time to wave bye-bye and exit.
<br>
<br>
Happened to me *so* many times where having a physical body came in mighty handy. Because it allows you to project to the Astral, screw up completely, and come back. Then you can think it over in the physical and try again.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so you again might again screw up (badly). But you can always come back, think it over, and try again. Maybe on the tenth time you project, you screw up a little less. By the fiftieth time your really starting to make good progress. By the hundreth time you managed to make contact and find out some of your history.
<br>
<br>
I suspect you have had little previous Physical experience, and the experiences you had, have not been all that happy. The thought strikes me you may have suffered some awful death, at a young age (around 6 to 8 years of age, say) in a near past physical life. Maybe even your previous one as the legacy is so strong.
<br>
<br>
But it's up to you now, to get your curiosity socks on and find out.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

&gt; read some astral projection books if you read projection of the astral body &gt;by sylvan muldoon (check out your local library they may have it) he stated &gt;what happens the moment one dies, he was talking about one guy he &gt;observed while in his astral body who was addicted to narcotics/alcohol &gt;and his life was upside down, he detailed described his aura was brown &gt;(which was bad) what happened when he was dying and being resusitated &gt;he was in his astral body then he went to grab his booze on the side &gt;which he couldn't then woke up then when he finally died he was in a &gt;really bad state and went franticly into oblivion once out.

What, you mean he ceased to exist? I find that unlikely.

Hi Comus,
<br>
<br>
I'm getting in to this topic fairly late, but thought I'd throw a few ideas at you.
<br>
I can't really comment much on the spiritual/astral side of suicide, just don't know enough about it. What I do know something about though is depression.
<br>
I went through it at the same time as going through a divorce (funnily enough the depression came first).
<br>
<br>
The line I want to take here is purely a medical one, hopefully to help give you a bit of insight here. Both Patty and Tisha have mentioned anti-depressants. I too can vouch for their effectiveness. There used to be (and to a degree still is) a real stigma about anti-depressants. This is simply because the general public don't really know what the current generation of medicines are, or what they do. You mention anti-depressant to someone and generally they think you're some raving nut who's had to go on prozac to mellow out. Utter crap!!
<br>
<br>
Medical science has well and truly proven that depression is not a "state of mind" but a "state of brain", more correctly a state of brain chemistry. Seratonin and Noradrenalin are two neurotransmitters that assist in the passing of signals from neuron to neuron. If these chemical transmitters are lacking, the brain doesn't work properly. You are quite literally not able to cope with things. Doctors are much more relaxed about prescribing anti-depressants now than they used to be. There is a wide variety neurotransmitter combinations and strengths, to take into account our different physiologies.
<br>
<br>
I can relate to your feelings of social ineptness. I hated school because I was generally the odd one out, and got picked on a lot. After school I was lucky though and fell in with a church youth group who were very accepting of who you were, but I still have a lot of social phobias. I absolutely hate crowds, and aviod shopping centres around christmas like the plague. This dislike of crowds has tended to make me a bit of a loner, and tend to put me at odds with a lot of people, even close friends.
<br>
<br>
A lot of this is not because you or I are in any ways dumb. I'm not saying this to boast at all but I have a consistently tested IQ of around 132. I can almost guarentee that you also have a high IQ. As does another good friend of mine who also suffered depression. Dumb people generally don't get depressed because they don't think about things enough to get depressed. It's more the way we look at things that sets us apart from others, and can tend to make us outcasts. When I look at the way a lot of people are these days I tend to think this is a good thing that I'm different (yes I do tend to be a bit cynical).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, please don't be afraid to seriously investigate anti-depressants. They're less of a temporary solution than you think! What they will do for you is level out your emotions, and enable you to get a grasp on things. This then becomes a cascade reaction. The more you get a grasp on things, the better things get. You will tend to look at things more objectivly, because your emotions are stable, and start seeing solutions where you couldn't before.
<br>
<br>
This ain't textbook stuff - I've lived through this, just as others like Patty and Tisha have. You eventually, slowly  take yourself off A-Ds because you feel stronger and more confident than before. I developed some real spiritual talents while I was on A-Ds probably because my brain was functioning much more effectively.
<br>
<br>
Well that about concludes my drug-pushing for today

<br>
Seriously though, if you are getting bummed out with depression, don't put up with it. It can be fixed, and fixing that will lead to fixing a whole lot of other stuff in your life. You can make all the lifestyle changes you want, but if you're not able to change your perspective, you're only curing the symptoms, not the cause.
<br>
<br>
Good things to you.
<br>
<br>

Kind of you to add some words of encouragement while you... insert an advertisement... into a nine-year-old thread...

Well, yeah, it is sad.

<br>
What makes me wonder about these forum-spamming people is the fact why don't they realise that no one, absolutely no one will be interested in the gibberish advertisement stuff they add here, it is just annoying and nothing else. If it is not disinterest in the added links and ads it is annoyance that keeps one from clicking on or reading it. Either way, it is a completely futile action. Of course, registered today - do you have no interesting hobbies, alicevision?

And it gets cleaned up... relatively quickly.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully we'll have some new moderators come on board who can assist in this... hopefully getting it cleaned up even more quickly.
