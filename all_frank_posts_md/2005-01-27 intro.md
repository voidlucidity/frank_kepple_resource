Hello to anyone reading this.
<br>
<br>
I am brand new to this topic, but been on the spiritual path since 1987, so I am quite open to extraordinary subject matter.  I heard Robert Bruce for the first time on Unknown Country last Saturday, then have spent hours listening at his website, listening to other interviews.
<br>
<br>
I am an empath and feel what others feel, which was very tricking, or as the British say, dicey as I was growing up.  I always had the feeling that other people didn't like me, because I felt negativity.  Well into adulthood I learned that I only reading their energy, in general.  I may be empathic, but I am very well protected by my angels, and have not had many unpleasant experiences as a result.  But I've had a few that I could talk about.
<br>
<br>
I used the very simple visualization for clearing negative energy and/or entities that have attached to me last night in the shower, imagining Divine White Light pouring into my crown chakra, and filling my entire body, pushing the dark energy (envisioned as thick, black smoke) ahead of it, and finally out the soles of my feet, then down the drain with the water.  And I can report the best night's sleep I've had in I don't know how long, good, happy dreams, and I awoke refreshed, energized and feeling optimistic, for the first time in many years!  I would like to discuss this in greater detail with someone else who has used this technique and benefited.
<br>
<br>
And I want to send a great big THANK YOU to Robert Bruce for putting it out there!
<br>
<br>
Sincerely, LunaBleu

Hi Luna,
<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you.
<br>
<br>
I've only just begun using the white light method myself, and have had good results. I am intrigued by how you use it in the shower. I'll have to give it a go.
<br>
<br>
Take a look around. This place is huge!

Greetings and Welcome to AtralPulse.
<br>
<br>
Some of the resident Empaths my rear their heads and offer more advice.  Besides clearing, selective filtering is very usefull to walk among the masses and retain your sense of 'Self'.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum. Water is a great cleanser in more ways than one. I use it all the time.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
