Hi guys I am new here I have known about astral projection for about a year and a half now and have always wanted to do it, but I have never found a way that let me. Â If any of you could help me it would be appreciated dearly.

<br>
Reading Alan Guiden's free online book 'Traveling Beyond The Body' might be a great place to start. Good luck!
