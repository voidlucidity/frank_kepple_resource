I am not a big clock watcher so I am always amused when this happens.  I get spurts where I see 11:11 on the clock.  This is my fifth time in the last three days.  Even woke up to a noise to see it on the clock.  Oh well, just one of those odd amusing things that sometimes happens.[

<section>
i've been seeing 9:11 on clocks for months now.. for no reason at all, my eyes will drift to a clock right when it says 9:11.. i catch the microwave timer when it's on 9:11.. i play games and see the number 911.. i post messages sometimes on other boards and ill look at it after i posted and it will have been posted at exactly 9:11 in another time zone. i know its more than just coincidence, because my eyes don't wander towards clocks or numbers unless i want to know what time it is, and when i look on purpose, it's never 9:11. only when my eyes stray on their own.
<br>
<br>
its really weird..

ok, this is something that has plauged me for the past like 2 months. i see 11:11 usually at least once a day (obviously no more than twice) i'm usually in the car but not always. It's so weird, i'll point it out to my girlfriend that i wasnt even trying to look what time it was, but my head just went right to the clock. there was a post not that long ago that someone had this theory that they found out about, it had something to do with when you were born and what your numbers were... mine was 11. i dont remember how it worked, if i can find it i'll post it on here.
<br>
<br>
another weird thing, last night i thought it happened to me because i looked at the clock that was on my digital tv reciever but it was actually 11:17, i just couldnt see the top of the 7, regardless, i didnt look at the clock with the intentions of seeing what time it was. it just happened.

<section>
This is very weird but I have a tendency to look at the clock when it reads the same numbers straight across. For example 3:33, 4:44 etc. I would not have even thought of mentioning it until I read your post. Now this, of course, does not happen all the time. However, it happens a lot, perhaps 2 or 3 times a day. No, I don't have a habit of always looking at the clock either.
<br>
<br>
Also, this is something that has only been happening in the last year or so. However, it happens to such an extent that I have commented on it to my wife at least a few times. I have no explanation. It's just very odd.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

I too have been noticing these times for the past 2 weeks or so, at least 10 times. this past weekend I even noticed it when I was totally drunk at 3:33 am. (Waking up during the night to see it on the clock though timeless, that's pretty spooky!) Yesterday I noticed my speedometer turn 99,999 (more obvious but I never notice the speedometer!). I've been noticing them ever since reading on some web site (can't remember where now) that it was a "sign" -of what I can't remember... something like being a lightworker, or nearing a new stage of spiritual development or something (it was really new-agey). Does anyone know what I'm referring to? I doubt it has validity but you never know... I bet some people will start to experience it from reading this post. It's strange how subconsciously we could be aware of and trigger a response to such things...

I don't know what the 11:11 is supposed to mean.
<br>
But I notice it all the time.
<br>
Last week it blew my mind when I was fueling up my car.
<br>
I had it on auto pump and was standing behind the car.
<br>
When the tank was full it stopped right on $11.11.

I took it to mean that there is a version of me or something that is all seeing (outside of just my eyeballs) and is able to direct me and que me... or i can direct this self from a higher level.  There seem to be some pretty profound and direct implications to be had from experienceing this phenomenon.
<br>
<br>
There is actually something that I think resembles a cult which is entirely dedicated to the 11:11 phenomenon.  I can't remember the web page for them at the moment.  They have a big thick book I have seen at the bookstore.  Do a search and i am sure that you will come up with the page.

I have seen 11:11 several times in the last few weeks, but I have always thought it would have been cool to be alive in the year 1111 which was the last time that the same number has been repeated throughout the entire time and date.  The eleventh second of the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the one thousand one hundred and eleventh year.  I mean you could take this as far as you want into the fractions of a second as well.

I looked it up, and here's a site with a whole bunch of people talking about noticing the "11:11 effect" too:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.greatdreams.com/11coin.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.greatdreams.com/11coin.htm
</a>
... interesting stuff. I don't know about any cult though, I didn't see anything on them. But I guess anyone could take it and make it a sign as part of their "club" since once people start thinking about it, their attention naturally goes to it.
<br>
<br>
(And Beav31is- as I was reading the aforementioned page, I couldn't help but look at the clock, which read 12:34... I didn't have seconds on the clock but who knows it just mighta been 56 seconds into the minute; it did turn a few seconds later

notice 3:14 a lot. But maybe that's just cause I really like pi.

<section>
yep, i to have been plagued by this myserious number for months, 111, 444, 222, and 420 now, i have found the meaning to these numbers! i found them on this site..
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.angelscribe.com/1111.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.angelscribe.com/1111.html

 http://www.namastecafe.com/cafearea/_disc2/0000001d.htm
</a>
<br>
<br>
1st set of meanings..
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
111 or 1111 Energy flow of water, money, sex, kundalini, magnetic
<br>
It happens when one of these energies manifests.
<br>
<br>
<br>
222 or 2222 In the middle of the proces of resurrection or the proces of ascension
<br>
<br>
333 or 3333 A decision number. Either one of the folowing can happen: 666 = material world or 999 = spiritual world.
<br>
<br>
444 or 4444 The Resurrection number.
<br>
<br>
555 or 5555 Christ consciousness
<br>
<br>
666 or 6666 Material world, chosen reality.
<br>
<br>
777: Symbolizes an integration of some portion of the four lower bodies with higher spiritual frequencies within the third-dimensional plane, or at level in which you are manifesting your physical reality on the Earth plan
<br>
<br>
888: Symbolizes infinity * The unified spiral of the physical merging with the Spiritual * Moving toward the completion of the ascension process through the energies of the 222 and 444
<br>
<br>
999: Symbolizes the three levels of the triune * completion
<br>
<br>
000: Great Void * Experiencing a null zone * switching or moving into a new energy field 11:11 Beginning of a whole new level or phase of development * Another dimension or frequency of experience * A PORTAL WAY OPENING *12:12 A COSMIC CONNECTION * A bridge to the future * Signifies a level of completion or graduation Pay attention to clocks, license plates, perhaps what you were doing at the time you sae that particular number.......what were you thinking, etc.I have found these to be very much a signal or sign after I have asled a question etc.
<br>
----------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
2nd set of meanings
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
111 - Monitor your thoughts carefully and be sure to only think about what you want, not what you don't want. This sequence is a sign that there is a gate of opportunity opening up and your thoughts are manifesting into form at record speeds. The 111 is like the bright light of a flashbulb. It means that the universe has just taken a snapshot of your thoughts and is manifesting it into form. Are you pleased with what thoughts the universe has captured? If not, correct your thoughts (ask your angels to help you with this if you have difficulty controlling and monitoring your thoughts).
<br>
<br>
222 - our newly planted ideas are beginning to grow into reality. Keep watering and nurturing them, and soon they will push through the soil so you can see evidence of your manifestation. In other words, don't quit 5 minutes before the miracle. Your manifestation is soon going to be evident to you, so keep up the good work. Keep holding positive thoughts, keep affirming, and continue visualizing.
<br>
<br>
333 - The Ascend Masters are near you, desiring you to know that you have their help, love, and companionship. Call upon the Ascend Masters often, especially when you see the number 3 pattern around you. Some of the more famous ascended masters include Jesus, Moses, Mary, Quan Yin, and Yogananda.
<br>
<br>
444 - The angels are surrounding you now, reassuring you of their love and help. Don't worry because the angels' help is nearby.
<br>
<br>
555 - Buckle your seatbelts, because a major life change is upon you. This change should not be viewed as being "positive" or "negative," since all change is but a part of life's flow. Perhaps this change is an answer to your prayers, so continue seeing and feeling yourself being at peace.
<br>
<br>
666 - Your thoughts are out of balance right now, focused too much on the material world. This number sequence asks you to balance your thoughts between heaven and earth. Like the famous "Sermon On The Mount," the angels ask you to focus on spirit and service, and know that your material and emotional needs will automatically be met as a result.
<br>
<br>
777 - The angels applaud you --- congratulations, your on a roll! Keep up the good work and know that your wish is coming true. This is an extremely positive sign and means that you should also expect more miracles to occur.
<br>
<br>
888 - A phase of your life is about to end, and this is a sign to give you forewarning so you can prepare. This number sequence may mean that you are winding up an emotional, career, or relationship phase. It also means that there is light at the end of the tunnel. In addition, it means, "The crops are ripe. Don't wait to pick and enjoy them." In other words, don't procrastinate making your move or enjoying the fruits of your labor.
<br>
<br>
999 - Completion. This is the end of a big phase in your personal or global life. Also, it is a message to lightworkers involved in Earth healing and means, "Get to work because Mother Earth needs you right now."
<br>
<br>
000 - A reminder that you are one with God, and feel the presence of your creator's love within you. Also, it is a sign that a situation has gone full circle
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ok so I'm actually now noticing patterns, but not on my clock.
   <br>
   <br>
   On the chat program I use (mIRC), you can code your own script and dress it up to look all cool ans everything.  I have my own mp3 player.  It is designed to display to the chan what song I play, how big the file iz, how long it is, and how many total songs I have played...
   <br>
   <br>
   Once my total songs broke 11,000, every time I notice that number (play count) it's always 2 digits ONLY.  Like just now it was 11313.  I've had 11010, 11221, 11121, 11311, and 11100.
   <br>
   <br>
   I don't ever look at that number.  That's the thing.  Sometimes i'll just be reading over some old stuff and notice that one number after scrolling through thousands of lines of words.  O.O  (&lt;-- shocked face!)

About a year ago I begin seeing 11:11 everytime I looked at the clock on a morning or night, and during the day it would be 11 minutes past the hour, then it changed to the numbers 21:21 &amp; 14:14, I would just keep seeing them, now in the present I always see 11 minutes past the hour, i'll see it on the clock on the wall, on the fax machine when im sending faxes, on the cloak in the car.

Fun. For me the number is 174, which somehow pops up from time to time. And guess what. After hastly reading this thread, I found a thread about some Cyber-Shaman program. I went to see the Yahoo group link. Number of the joined members was 174.

I chose not to join, it would've broken the magic. [

Probably a coincidence, imho. There's so much numbers around us these days anyway - some part of our brain gets fixated on a set of numbers, filtering out others from our consciousness.

   <br>
   <br>
   3:33am - I check the clock and realize I really should be getting to bed.
   <br>
   <br>
   12:12pm - I wake up.
   <br>
   <br>
   1:11pm - I tell someone it's 1:11 in America, he says it's 7:11 there.
