Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce, is probly the best of the best, when it comes to this paticular subject. Cash your pennies in if you have to. It is WELL worth it.

You definitely need "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce.
<br>
<br>
If you want a detailed training programme, also get "Mastering Astral Projection" by Robert Bruce and Brian Mercer.
<br>
<br>
The books by Robert A. Monroe are also a "must read" (for starting OBEers especially the first one "Journeys out of the body"), as is the classic "The Projection of the Astral Body" by Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward Carrington.
<br>
<br>
Another two books I'd recommend are "Out of body experiences" by Robert Peterson and "Out of body" by William Buhlman.

I'd also recommend Robert Peterson's books.  He offers one of them in ebook form free on his website -
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.robertpeterson.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.robertpeterson.org/
</a>
and it's a good a read. They are interesting personal narratives on his OBE experiences in addition to some various training exercises/ideas in the back (nothing new or groundbreaking).

btw sinister I think you should remove your address from your post, by using the "edit" feature.  There are a load of strange people around who will misuse it!  (Not regular members of this board of course!
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
)  If anyone offers to send you a copy, I recommend usingthe PM feature and you can give your address using this, but otherwise keep it private!  Sorry I'm bitter and twisted and cynical!

Hello:
<br>
<br>
If money is tight then my reco would be Astral Dynamics for a good all round practical book on this topic. The two later Monroe books, IMO, are good books but are not really geared for beginners, as they contain no actual techniques or methods. They are more aligned to Monroe's thoughts and experiences.
<br>
<br>
Monroe's first book
<i>
 Journeys
</i>
is a tad dated now, especially in regard to all the talk about various "locales" which has been superceded by his later focus-levels concept. But this was the very book that got me into all this 20-odd years ago. The technique Monroe gave in the book worked really well for me.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Monroe's original book was the one which opened it all up for me.  It's written in simple language.  It's a
<i>
 must
</i>
for anyone interested in the field.  I actually like the idea of locales presented in the book.  RB's
<i>
 Astral Dynamics
</i>
is undoubtedly one of the best books on the market today, also a
<i>
 must
</i>
.  Also look at Buhlman, Peterson, Muldoon and Fox. But there are many others, I'm thinking of compiling a list but it would take some time...

These are the two guys who started it all off,
<i>
 very highly
</i>
recommended...
<br>
<br>
Sylvan Muldoon:

 http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/087728069X/
</a>
<br>
Oliver Fox:

 http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0821600125/
</a>
<br>
<br>
Personally I prefer Muldoon's precision and detail, but I also loved Fox's haunting
<i>
 Farewell Song of the Soul
</i>
.  Please
<i>
 read
</i>
.  Get copies from your library if nothing else!
