Hey guys, I was wondering if you guys could tell me some good techniques on getting into a trance fairly quick.  Because the method i'm usind right now takes me about 15-25 minutes to get into a trance.  I would appreciate any help and other advice that you would be willing to give me me cuz' i've only been trying for about 3 weeks now.  Also, if it helps any i'm 15.  Thanks a lot.

What method are you currently using? If you can give us some details we might be able to give you some advice. 15-25 minutes is pretty good, especially for being new at it. I think 15 minute is a good average. Sometime it takes me only 5 minute while other times it can take 30 minutes or more. It depends on several things really. Practice is going to be your best bet.

The current method I'm using to get into a trance right now is ROPE.  I tried it because Robert Bruce says that if you just do the relaxation skills and then do ROPE right away, it will get you into a trance, energize your chakras, and get you out of your body.  With using this method, I get into a light trance, (sometimes in a good enough trance to project) but I don't feel any vibrations or hear any humming; so I get frustrated since I can't feel any signs of near projection and I concentrate to get out of the trance.  I've only gotten into a good trance about two times using this method, and I'm searching for a method that will get me into a deeper trance, and that wil get me feeling the vibrations and stuff.
