<section>
I was wondering if anyone has experience projecting into strange, exotic or extreme type places? I've heard stories of people checking out the moon and this piqued my interest. So.... please share your stories if you've been to such places as:
<br>
<br>
The Sun
<br>
<br>
Mars or another inner celestial body
<br>
<br>
A lightning storm/hurricane/tornado
<br>
<br>
The ocean (I'm assuming the depth light penetrates only)
<br>
<br>
Volcanoes
<br>
<br>
While on an airplane
<br>
<br>
Strip Clubs/etc...
<img alt=":twisted:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/evil.png" title="evil"/>
<br>
<br>
Iranian Nuclear Facilities
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you've got some other place interesting I failed to list please feel free to add to it.

big ben (as in the giant clock in london), on another forum there have been two expiriments to try and meet up with each other out of body, the 2nd one was big ben, sure the expiriment failed (due to the different time zones everyone had) but it was a cool being up ontop of a giant clock (though the expiriment might be a part success since some woman that was part of the expiriment claimed she saw a man that smiled at her and saw her precense so who knows maybe it did work)

Hello:
<br>
<br>
I have a regular guide-friend who projects to me fairly often. He is resident on another physical planet and I've been there a number of times. The place looks a lot like our physical world, but without all the aggression and the violence. The technology is really interesting. It is something we are set to have he says. They have all kinds of machines and things like us, but they are all biological. They live in houses, as we do, but the houses are "planted" as a seed and they "grow". Houses are self-heating, self-repairing, self lighting, etc. The streetlamps fascinate me the most because the light itself is actually a living creature.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hi kenshin
<br>
<br>
The Big Ben experiment was proferred by me!  It was going to be my first astral birthday and I suggested an astral party on top of Big Ben.
<br>
<br>
Did you get there?  I never made it.  Did I leave any astral canapes out for you?!!
<br>
<br>
You'd think I'd have a good chance of achieving this - I work in London and pass Big Ben close up at least twice a week.

I OBE'd once while on an airplane. My astral body moved relative to my physical fortunately. What was interesting was that as I moved around I could hear other people's thoughts. An acquaintance I had made in the airport was a native Spanish speaker. When I floated past her I heard her voice (thoughts) speaking in Spanish.
<br>
Just a note when you do OBE with other people present in a room, don't go inside their heads to hear their thoughts. You can hear the thoughts from a few feet away. If you do go inside their heads, which I tried once... it's an extreme experience! ... you'll pick up their brain frequencies and goodness knows whatever other electrical stuff is going on.

Hey Frank, your post caught my attention (as they usually do!). Specifically this part:

<br>
I found this book awhile ago.  "The Third Millennium; Living in the Posthistoric World".  Its been an inspiring book for me for a long time now.  It is a prophetic book that talks of the evolutionary awakening of the human species.  The author states in the book that this decade will be the one in which we will "awaken" to the subconscious or spiritual realms as a global population (roughly 15% of us anyway).
<br>
<br>
He describes future technological advances like this:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 The future holds inventions of a far more organic nature than those of the historical era.  On the surface these inventions will appear simpler than the cumbersome technology of today, yet inherently they will be far more sophisticated.  They will be ecologically enhancing, durable and easy to produce.  But the chief feature distinguishing them from solid-state historical structures is that they will be alive.
</blockquote>
<br>
You said your friend says "It is something we are set to have".  Has he ever mentioned a time frame?

I projected in the RTZ to the sun,about 5 years ago:
<br>
<br>
I was relaxing early in the morning,and I felt astral awareness creeping in,so I buzzed out of my body,down through the floor of my room,and into the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///kitchen.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 kitchen.It
</a>
was just after sunrise,and it might have been something about the fresh morning light,but everything was more beautiful than I could have
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///imajined.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 imajined.It
</a>
was like everything was
<i>
 shining from within
</i>
.Then I looked out the window and saw the sun rising over the cloudy
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///horizon.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 horizon.As
</a>
soon as I saw that,I flew through the window,and up into the sky,passing through the clouds mentioned
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///earlier.as" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 earlier.As
</a>
I reached deep space,the blue sky gradually turned to black,and the sun appeared to be brighter,due to the increased contrast of the blackness of space,versus the bly sky on earth.
<br>
I Flew deep into space,headed directly toward the sun,which looked like a shining beacon in space,surrounded by it's outer corona.I picked up speed,travelling at
<i>
 incredible speed
</i>
,but didn't seem to be making any real progress,so I
<i>
 willed
</i>
myself there.Then I was instantly transported near to the sun (I would estimate the distance to be several hundred-thousand miles from it).
<br>
It was bright,but somehow it didn't affect my astral vision negatively, as it would basically BLIND my physical
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///eyes.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 eyes.It
</a>
looked like an ocean of boiling,roiling fire,and noticed the strange magnetic patterns of 'fire' caused on the surface.
<br>
<br>
Then,a mind-split effect occured-I was suddenly aware of my foot propped up  in bed in an odd way,and was instantly drawn back to my body.I awoke,and said "holy crap!" to myself,then went downstairs to look out the window.the sun,and clouds were basically the same,except for a slight shift in the suns position on the horizon (a little higher),and the clouds (changed a little,but same style of cloud,and same basic positioning).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and another RTZ experience,a bit after the above one:
<br>
<br>
I felt the usual astral awareness creeping in again,so I fired myself out of my body at super-speed-traght up into the sky,and through some stratus clouds.I was travelling so fast that within less than 10 seconds,I was in the blackness of space.I flew towards some star formations,but then noticed there were more stars to my upper-right,so I did a graceful turn,and gained even more speed.
<br>
And yet despite the speed I was travelling at,I NEVER noticed a single change with respect to how much closer I got to the stars.I passed what must have been some gigantic space rock I could just barely see in the distance,to my right.I figured it must have been huge because I was travelling very,very fast,but I still passed it at a fairly casual pace.
<br>
Then a sense of fear of going too far came over me,and I was suddenly pulled back to my body.
<br>
I awoke amazed,and went to the library that day to consult some star charts and their monthly positions.I found out that I was flying towards the approxximate centre of our galaxy.That is why there were more stars at my upper right.
<br>
<br>
<br>
These experiences are the honest to god TRUTH.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
.I'll never forget them,and I do have more plans-among them to enter the centre of the sun,visit mars,and other local planets,and to visit stand-out deep sky places such as the pleiades (SP?) star cluster,and the orion nebula.
<br>
<br>
However,the RTZ projections used to just happen
<i>
 naturally
</i>
,and ever since I went on meds for anxiety (anti-depressants),I've been shielded from sensing/travelling to the astral regions,and barely even get any lucid dreams any more

<img alt=":roll:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/rolleyes.png" title="Roll Eyes"/>
).So I've really been searching for ways to get back into it.I had a dream recently (See My thread in the "Dreams" section of astral pulse forums) that started to point the way,but I need MORE advice from whatever source I can find.

jason,
<br>
<br>
I too take meds for anxiety/depression. SSRI's. Doesn't seem to effect my ability to become lucid which is my key to AP. Very thankful for that. Sometimes I find success has to do with how much sleep debt I have and how much stress is in my life. For me, stress is bad
<img alt=":x" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/angry.png" title="Angry"/>
and so is sleepiness
<img alt=":x" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/angry.png" title="Angry"/>
for AP's.  Hmmm. Before meds, were you able to project from waking consciousness or lucid dreams or both?

<br>
I tried this a few days ago. I started to fly towards it, but it didn't seem to get any closer, so I kept picking up speed. Due to the distance involved I figured I would try and 'teleport' to it instead, reasoning I couldnt cover the distance needed before I had to go back to my body. So I closed my eyes, focused on my destination and 'pulled' myself to it. But when I opened my eyes I have no idea where I was. I seemed to be in rock or something, it was streaked with brown, dark red and orange. These bands seemed to be seen in 3 dimensions all around me.
<br>
I went back to my body not long after - not being able to work out where I had jumped to.

I was mainly projecting from waking conciousness.I would lay down to relax and this "certain feeling" (can't really describe it-it isn't like any other feeling I've
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///experienced.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

's sort of like a "depth",and almost a "mystical" quality to it
<img alt=":?" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
).
<br>
<br>
The projections were actually waning in regularity for a number of years (about a decade).I started out with severe,HEAVY vibrations when I was 15,after trying techniques descibed in R Monroe's "journeys out of the body".I was just buzzing around everywhere constantly.Then the experiences got less regular,but more intense,and much more vivid (like the ones above).Over the years,the "naturalness" sort of faded away,gradually replaced by less regular,but more amazing experiences.
<br>
<br>
And then when I went on the meds,I had a couple more projections (to astral dimensions),and then they just
<i>
 stopped
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I barely lucid dream anymore,and haven't had an OBE in over a year!
<br>
<br>
what the hell is going on?
<br>
<br>
and how can I get around it?
<br>
<br>
One of my ideas (based on Journeys out of the Body),is that I had a lot of pent up sexual energy when I was young,and now I don't
<img alt=":lol:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>

<br>
I can run energy through my body,and still meditate frequently,but just can't get those projections like I need to.
<br>
<br>
<br>
could my guides be testing me,as is to say "let's see how you gather your resources-what do you do NOW?"

jason,
<br>
<br>
I certainly empathize with your situation. I wouldn't want to lose the special gift that I've been granted. It would almost be like losing 1 of the 5 senses.
<br>
I'm not a doctor, but I'm curious as to the particular type of meds you are taking to
<br>
control anxiety. Extended release tranquilizers like klonopin, I can
<br>
imagine could cause a problem. If you'd like  you can send me a PM regarding these details.
<br>
Worst case scenario, there's a few possible techniques that may help you recover dream lucidity. 1) You could re-learn lucid dreaming techniques. From the LD state you can OBE/AP without too much more skills 2) You could listen to some Hemi-Sync CD's - they tend to induce LD's for me even though they don't work while I'm listening to them. 3) There's a teacher I've learned about that provides energy work by telepathic request. When I ask for help from him, I achieve lucidity that night and the experience is super vivid.

When I started practicing astral projection, I got very good results, very quickly, verything short of a full blown obe. Shortly after that I was on paxil, an SSRI(anti-dep. and anti-anx.), for almost a year. During that time I had absolutely no results with projection attempts. No vibes, no energy sensations, I could barely get into and maintain a light trance state. I ended up getting off track and pretty much stoped all together. I read an article online somewhere saying that SSRI's can make it very difficult to achieve an obe.
<br>
<br>
About a month after I was off paxil, I started practing again, and little by little got more and more results. Around 2 1/2 months is when everything returned to normal, when all the side effects of paxil where finnaly gone, and I ended up having my first obe.

Hope this helps, in some way.

<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
.I'm getting to know the sky pretty well,and could navigate my way around,if I could only get around the meds thing.
<br>
<br>
which makes me want to ask-
<br>
<br>
Do you think that meds (SSRI's) affect phasing and lucid dreaming as well?
<br>
<br>
-'cause if they do,all hope is lost-I'm on meds
<i>
 long term
</i>
.

For me, SSRI's are not a problem for OBE/LD. They actually slightly help.
<br>
I guess everyone is different.

SSRIs do, afaik, increase the production of serotonin. Parts of the serotonin will be converted to melatonin by enzymes. Melatonin is said to increase the vividness of dreams.

never really was a lucid dreamer, and never really tried phasing, so im not sure.

Paxil pretty much messed up my sleep in general, which is why I couldn't project. At night, I would get
<i>
 tired
</i>
but not
<i>
 sleepy,
</i>
which is believe it or not a huge difference. I would just sit on my computer until morning without sleeping. My eyes wouldn't get heavy, i wouldn't yawn, i wouldn't really loose focus, i'd just be tired.  I actually didn't really realize how much it effected my sleep until I got off.

Why are you on long term?  If it is just for depression or anxeity, there are other options besides meds. I was quote long term too, I just decided that I didn't want to depend on the meds anymore and just stoped taking them. The docs may say you are "long term" but your the person who has the final say on that.
<br>
<br>
Anyways good luck with this.  And yes to bringing this thread back, this is a great discussion about how different meds effect this sort of thing.
