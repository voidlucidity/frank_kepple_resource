<section>
If it is in fact true that all living things posess a non-physical body with which they will inhabit the afterlife world, is it possible that then there will be the same problems with the same people in the Astral dimensions such as war and cruelty? Has anyone witnessed these occurences in their travels and experiences?
<br>
I would like to open up a discussion to see and hear what you may have experienced or think about this topic.
<br>
Is it possible that there is such thing as astral wars? Good vs. Evil in the truest sense?

Personally I believe the Astral is nowhere near where our souls go when we die, I beleive it to be merely 1 of 7 sub dimensions of what we call our current reality - beyond this place there are maybe something like 11 other dimensions all also divided into 7 sub dimensions.
<br>
All this isnt including alternate realitys neither, the idea there could be countless trillions or an infinate number of parallel universes.
<br>
<br>
I believe we are either reincarnated in this dimension in the physical world or we ascend (only if ready) to a higher dimension where we are born into a new world unlike anything we see here.

It is Possible that the scourges of War and Violence continue to plague beings on the Astral and Ethereal planes. Though this possibility May exist those problems are far from certainties. Perhaps God/gods/higher beings banish major conflicts in those realms. [?]
<br>
Anyways it is tempting to believe that there is no War on the higher planes. [

Hey lucid_dreamer.
<br>
<br>
Nice topic.
<br>
<br>
I've met 'low' entities. I used to go to the astral a lot back in the day just to fight them. [:O]... for fun.
<br>
<br>
When I used to unconsciously float around into low astral areas, and get 'awoken' by the pummeling of an astral entity. (If I didn't beat them then, I'd go back and handle my biz though. [:O])
<br>
<br>
When battling got old I would just fly up to a 'higher' dimension.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. [

The higher realms are inhabited by people who have shrugged off all notions of good-v-evil. I used to go on tours of the lower realms where all the drama takes place. I suppose these places held a kind of morbid fascination. But it really is nice now, projecting out and breathing in the atmosphere of the higher realms. It is so incredibly uplifting.

The lessons learned here in the physical hopefully give us a shot at those higher realms or planes. I sure don't want to end up in some celestial battlefield version of planet earth.

"The higher realms are inhabited by people who have shrugged off all
<br>
notions of good-v-evil."
<br>
<br>
When you said that, did you mean that they have matured beyond the
<br>
business of conflict, or do you mean that they no longer undertake
<br>
to define what is good and what is evil?
<br>
<br>
The reason I ask, is that I come across such ideas in reading
<br>
Elias, and other channeled material. If such a thing could be true,
<br>
then it would seem that morality is local to the system you are in,
<br>
and does not come from a higher level. Such a thing would be a
<br>
major issue of doctrine.
