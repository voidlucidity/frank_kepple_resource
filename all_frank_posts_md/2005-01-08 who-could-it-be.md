A couple months back i woke up early. it was 7 am. i went up stairs and and just layed on the couch. just looking out side. i was all alone. i fell asleep. well i had the mind awake body asleep thing going on. i woke up completely paralyzed. i had strong vibs going on. it felt like i was shaking inside not out side. Well i thought it would be the best time to project. at the time i have never projected and i was very nervous. it seems like i could see but i couldn't it was very odd. but right before i projected i heard a woman call my name. It was very peaceful sounding. kinda familiar but sense it was my first time projecting i was scared out of my mind. i fought it so much but it took a while for me to be in control of my body. Could this just be a spirit talking to me through the astral? But it sounded familiar like i heard it a few times before.
<br>
<br>
i was thinking even a angle or a spirit guide? Ever happen to u guys?

Hi Smooth,
<br>
Just been working with a woman who heard her name being called...  today she met her primary Guide and learned how to open to the Light.  She was called to it.
<br>
<br>
When I was 7 years old I woke up to my name being called, and it too was my primary guide.  I was called to it.
<br>
<br>
Maybe you are being called too.
<br>
<br>
Try methods for direct personal contact with the Caller.  You will find some ideas from the Light method described in my home pages, get to it by the link in my signature.
<br>
<br>
Good luck, I hope some of it helps.
<br>

Hello:
<br>
<br>
This kind of thing is very normal. The person was probably just an alternate self. We all have an an infinite number of them so chances are you are going to meet one or two on your travels. :)  It's one thing taking about the multi-dimensionality of consciousness, but it is usually quite another thing actually coming face to face with that reality. No need to be scared, it's only your own self. That's why it feels familiar to you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
