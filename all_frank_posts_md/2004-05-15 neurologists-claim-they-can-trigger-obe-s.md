<section>
Reports of  out-of-body sensations have been common throughout history. The Greek philosopher Plato was among the first to suggest that when the body dies and disintegrates, the soul migrates outside the body and continues to live. Characters in countless paranormal dramas have been resuscitated back to life and then speak about how they rose above their own bodies and watched others working feverishly to save them.
<br>
<br>
But rarely has the sensation been captured in the controlled setting of a laboratory - until now.
<br>
<br>
In a new study released today in the journal Nature, Swiss scientists describe how they were able to trigger bizarre, out-of-body experiences in a 43-year-old female epileptic patient while analyzing her brain with electrodes.
<br>
<br>
Accidental Discovery
<br>
<br>
Olaf Blanke, a neurosurgeon at University Hospitals of Geneva and Lausanne, wasn't trying to set off the sensations in his patient but was using electrical stimulation to map the activity of her brain in preparation for surgical treatment. But by recording the patient's reactions and matching them with specific electrodes, Blanke was able to pinpoint the region where out-of-body experiences seem to originate.
<br>
<br>
"We wanted [and needed] to be sure that what the patient experienced and told us was related to the actual stimulation," says Blanke.
<br>
<br>
When Blanke and colleagues activated electrodes placed just above the patient's right ear - a region known as the right angular gyrus - the woman began to have the strange sensations. Depending on the amplitude of the stimulation and the current position of the patient's body, her experience varied. Each of the patient's four episodes lasted about two seconds.
<br>
<br>
After one stimulation, the patient said she felt as though she were sinking into her bed and then she felt as though she were "falling from a height." After another stimulation she said felt like she was "floating" about 6½ feet above her bed, close to the ceiling. When she was asked to watch her legs during the stimulation, the patient said she saw her legs "becoming shorter."
<br>
<br>
Scientists have long tried to explain how people might have such sensations. Last December a British journal described a Dutch study that estimated 12 percent of cardiac patients resuscitated from clinical death experience out-of-body sensations such as seeing a bright light or their own dead bodies. In 1995, Michael Persinger, a psychologist at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, found he was able to trigger out-of-body and other paranormal experiences in people by exposing the right sides of their brains to a series of electromagnetic pulses.
<br>
<br>
Severe migraines, small strokes and epilepsy have also been known to trigger the condition and previous work has located the cause to the brain's right lobe.
<br>
<br>
Right Brain Condition
<br>
<br>
Blanke says his study shows the right angular gyrus has a specific role in triggering the feeling. This region is the part of the brain that scientists believe integrates visual information, including how the body is seen, and touch and balance sensations that all work together to create the mind's representation of the body.
<br>
<br>
He says out-of-body experiences "may reflect a failure by the angular gyrus" to integrate these different channels of information. Physical stress, or a lack of oxygen to the brain, he says, might trigger the kind of brain misfiring he induced in his patient.
<br>
<br>
Vilayanur Ramachandran, a professor of neurosciences and psychology at the University of California in San Diego, says Blanke's study makes sense since damage to the same region of the brain has been known to cause a confused physical sense of the body. But, he adds, it's rare to be able to induce the sensation.
<br>
<br>
"This is exciting because it shows this technology can be used to produce reversible lesions," he says. "This can be a powerful tool to study the condition."
<br>
<br>
But Robert Peterson, a person who regularly experiences out-of-body experiences and who has written about them in two books, argues no study can prove the sensations are just the result of a quirk in the brain.
<br>
<br>
"People who have these experiences are nearly always extremely firm in their convictions," he says. "No amount of evidence can convince the subjects that it wasn't 'real.'"
<br>
<br>
Persinger of Laurentian University argues it only illuminates how much is left to learn about the human brain.
<br>
<br>
"This is more evidence," he says, "that that great raveled knot - our brain - still has a lot of mysteries to unfold."
<br>
<br>
What do you think of it? I think it is a load of bollox, especially if the person has a feeling of actually BEING there not just experiencing it in a dream. If the say that it is ONLY in the brain then that is good news for us to fight against them as we can say that we can tell events that happened in a completely different location and it can be validated. Like if they said that the brain has the power to actually put you out of your body they might have a case but as for now they are chasing nothing.
<br>
<br>
I read this book that a man was having brain surgery and his heart and lungs were pumping through an external heart and lungs machine and there was ABSOLUTELY no electric impulses in his brain AND he eyes were covered completely and his ears were as well so he could hear nothing. After the operation he explained in devastating detail the operation that happened from his own point of view as in looking AT the Doctor.
<br>
<br>
Why didn't these Neurologists put in this infotmation into the report or that people can actually link up with each other duting OBE's by imagining each other or that OBEer's actually know whats going on it another room (through a sold wall).
<br>
<br>
What are your opinions on this?

As people of science, they wouldn't put anything like that in any kind of report, lest they lose credibility in the eyes of their colleagues. This is assuming that they even went in that direction in their testing, which I doubt that they did.
<br>
<br>
I suppose that someone could use the same methods and equipment to prove the existence of genuine OBEs.

I'm a stakeholder somewhat in that brain business, and have to say that this research has little, if any significance.

You have to read Mr. Bruce comment about it, which seems to hit the heart of the matter.

I came across this discovery almost a year ago so I believe it, in fact I know it works first hand. This was before I was interested in projection so I didnt know what these sensations were nor did the friend of mine who experienced it also. I completely forget what I was doing at the time but I had a pc fan and my phone line was already spliced from trying an idea I had that involved splicing my line anyway I wanted to hook this led lit pc fan up to the phone line out of boredom never-the-less my friend was holding the phone to his right ear and listening when I hooked up the fan it kicked on and generated clicking sounds on the line I looked over at him about 20 seconds after I hooked the fan up to the line and he was falling over with an odd look on his face. He dropped the phone and after me asking him about 10 times what was going on (he seemed to be incoherent) he said "you have to try that"
<br>
Anyway I put the phone up to my ear and first I heard the clicks (which have nothing to do with the effects of this) I started to feel light (my body) and at the same time a certain heaviness and a few other bodily sensations and noises after about 20 seconds I started to black out and feel a sort of acceleration and lifting the phone fell out of my hand and I snapped out of it I dont know how long after I snapped out of it because it felt longer than it really was in real time. I didnt have the guts to try it again but it seems the motor was generating some kind of emp (not much but a little) and perhaps somehow made the phone do the same I am not exactly sure what happened exactly but we both held it up to the right side of the head to listen, I never did try it on the left side. Anyhow perhaps you can try and duplicate what I mentioned and see for yourselves.
<br>
It wasnt until about 6 months ago I got into the whole astral projection thing and I still have yet to experience a projection, but at any rate it wasnt until about 6 months ago I even considered that the effects might have to do with out of body experiences.
<br>
Anyway basically what I did was splice a connected phone line and connected a led lit pc fan ( I am sure any fan will work but I am not quite sure why it did what it did so maybe it plays a role) to the phone line, and then just picked up the phone and listened (with the right ear) and that was all it took, just be careful and if you decide to try this and it does work try not to hold the phone to your ear too long if you are standing you might want to sit down and have a friend close by in case, you never know because the effects to me felt like I was dying although I am not sure thats the case my friend said he felt as though he was dying too, which is how he explained it when I asked him what he felt.
<br>
I typed a book here lol anyway if you decide to try it and experience anything let me know via email. Take care.

Neurologists can trigger obes by effecting the brain, think of the brain as the in-between filter of the two states. It should be clear how this is possible with this understanding.

Taken from Conversations with Scientists Initiates

 MAGNETIC COMPONENTS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY
 <br>
 <br>
 Let me continue. I already discussed the importance of the
 <br>
 magnetic component of brain activity in studying and monitoring brain
 <br>
 processes and functions accurately and precisely. Further research by
 <br>
 our Russian colleagues has also shown that with parallel computing
 <br>
 algorithms, one can plot three-dimensionally the magnetic field
 <br>
 configuration and spatio-temporal time-varying fields of the
 <br>
 midbrain's thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, pituitary
 <br>
 and pineal functions in real time!
 <br>
 <br>
 This is unprecedented, because it shows that, as we all here
 <br>
 have learned in our Hermetic Gnostic Order's teachings, the so-called
 <br>
 "Cave of Brahma", Dr. N's favourite "hang-out" (laughter), is indeed
 <br>
 the magnetic and acoustic resonance chamber, its being a topological
 <br>
 complex analogue of an ellipsoidal, prolate spheroid and a torus.
 <br>
 <br>
 In American lingo, I think that is called, a doughnut inside an egg?
 <br>
 (Laughter) May I have the cine film strip please? Thank you. (Short
 <br>
 film showing computer graphics is shown).
 <br>
 <br>
 This shows a real-time plot of the nested magnetic fields around
 <br>
 my own head. This piece of research was a little favour from a British
 <br>
 colleague that likes to work nights. They call it the "Dracula Shift"
 <br>
 (laughter). The white lines of the overallur, the green the Hypothalamus
 <br>
 plus Thalamus field, the red the Hippocampus plus Amygdala cycloid-shaped
 <br>
 field (semi-circular), and the dumb-bell shaped blue is the Epyphisis
 <br>
 (Pineal) and Hypophysis (Pituitary) combined fields.
 <br>
 <br>
 I wrote this algorithm myself with the help of Professor Penrose --
 <br>
 another unofficial favour -- to map the magnetic fields using both
 <br>
 the SQUID sensor helmets and a special helmet designed by Dr. Z
 <br>
 having Delta-T and Delta-Wye transforms, having specially designed
 <br>
 magnetic coils and sensors.  This way we could pick up Pico and
 <br>
 Nanogauss fields (billionth of a Gauss). The combined information is
 <br>
 displayed here in three-dimensional coloured graphics.
 <br>
 <br>
 Notice the external white-lined shape is like an egg. Inside, almost
 <br>
 at the centre, is the toroidal shape of the Hippocampus-Amygdala
 <br>
 combined fields, the red contours. The central tube-like "sausage
 <br>
 with trumpet-like open ends" looks like what? Anyone? (Chorus: "An
 <br>
 Einstein-Rosen Bridge!" Right!
 <br>
 <br>
 The blue-green combined field of the Thalamus-Hypothalamus-
 <br>
 Pituitary-Pineal glands forms a sausage, like a mini hyperspace
 <br>
 tunnel, about 7cm long. The screen image is magnified, but the actual
 <br>
 side is about 7cm, (reflecting) the normal brain size.
 <br>
 <br>
 Let me pause as minute. Can we replay that part? Thanks. Notice
 <br>
 how the overall geometry is an ellipsoidal prolate spheroidal
 <br>
 cavity containing a sub-space of a toroid traversed by a hyperbolic,
 <br>
 non-linear Einstein-Rosen bridge.  Again, in American lingo, "an
 <br>
 egg-shaped cavity containing a doughnut crossed by a sausage".
 <br>
 <br>
 What do these nested fields look like to you, dear friends? (Cross
 <br>
 talk and comments).  A topological analogue of a relativistic,
 <br>
 locally curved space-time locus around a solar system. Of course!
 <br>
 <br>
 What else? A space-time torus with an Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting
 <br>
 its median points!
 <br>
 <br>
 There, ladies and gentlemen...there is the scientific proof that
 <br>
 the motto of our Order, the dictum of the ancient sages, "As Above,
 <br>
 So Below ... As Within, So Without" is scientifically and
 <br>
 neurophysiologically correct and precisely so! These shapes which you
 <br>
 all recognise as hyperspatial four-dimensional plots, are indeed
 <br>
 magnetic-acoustical resonance chambers. Notice that these amazing
 <br>
 geometries are the synergistic effect of the magnetic fields of these
 <br>
 six organs surrounded by the ventricles, under the roof of the choroid
 <br>
 plexus and corpus callosum.
 <br>
 <br>
 Notice what happens if I subtract the field of even a single organ,
 <br>
 let's say the pineal gland.  See how it changes the entire structure?13
 <br>
 And, if I add the contribution of the mamillary body, it only widens
 <br>
 the tube, right? And if we add the field from the reticular formation,
 <br>
 the master circuit network, relay and switchboard of the brain where
 <br>
 all waves are originated, what do we get? Next frame, please? We get
 <br>
 a tunnel merging with the main ellipsoidal field. In the screen, it is
 <br>
 the orange coloured grid.
 <br>
 <br>
 To summarize, what is our Mid-Brain or Inner Cavity? It is a
 <br>
 relativistic spatio-temporal cavity with local enfolded hyperspatial
 <br>
 bridges that undergoes harmonic resonances to magnetic and acoustical
 <br>
 stimuli. The implications are almost astronomical - may use the term,
 <br>
 because a model and mechanism based on this novel scientific information
 <br>
 implies that our human brain is in reality none other than a biological
 <br>
 space-time energy transducer.
 <br>
 <br>
 As such, it creates not only space, but also time. Our ancient Chinese
 <br>
 ancestors maintained that "the Tao was in our head", in other words,
 <br>
 all the Universe was in our head!
 <br>
 <br>
 My own inference from this study is that space and time are
 <br>
 essentially biologically modulated, perhaps even formulated, for my
 <br>
 equations show that possibility. Should this intuitive scientific
 <br>
 insight be correct, then it would demolish physics, biology,
 <br>
 philosophy and theology in a single, clean blow.
 <br>
 <br>
 Incidentally, I showed this filmstrip and discussed my theory
 <br>
 and equations with Professor Penrose, who seemed interested at first,
 <br>
 but very politely declined any further comment or association with me
 <br>
 thereafter.14  I think he realised the impact of a novel theory. He is
 <br>
 still convinced that quantum mechanics is the answer to explain brain
 <br>
 functions and consciousness. I disagree. I think it is General
 <br>
 Relativity and Unified Field a la Einstein, pure and simple.
 <br>
 <br>
 Quantum phenomena is not the cause, but merely the effect, and creation
 <br>
 is not statistical. It is wholeheartedly deterministic, not left to
 <br>
 chance, but to precisely formulated potentials, not fields. The
 <br>
 potentials are the cause, the fields are the effects. In simple terms,
 <br>
 pure magnetism and sound are the potentials. Electricity is the field.
 <br>
 Magnetism and sound do not "travel" as such, for they are inherently
 <br>
 enfolded in space and are everywhere. It is the disturbance that
 <br>
 travels.
 <br>
 <br>
 On the other hand, electrical charge, hence electricity, does travel,
 <br>
 because it needs a physical medium. It is obvious that we still don't
 <br>
 understand either magnetism or the true nature of sound.

<b>
 Mind cannot be brain function alone
</b>
<br>
<br>
<i>
 In Fig.6 brains of matter are illustrated connecting with sense organs, represented by eyes, which observe crystals of matter by capturing photons reflected from them. All are built from matter. However, the brains on this model are only inert instruments used to operate the muscles of the body by interfacing with minds. Minds are isolated fragments of the i-ther (intelligent ether) connecting with each brain. Inferred to explain existing data, each brain is shown in direct communication with its conscious mind but the latter is separated by an information filter-barrier, programmed into the i-ther, to separate it from a sub-conscious component of the mind. Information can then flow from the conscious to the sub-conscious but not vice-versa. Then only the sub-conscious part can be in direct communication with all others via the filamentous network of the i-ther. In this way the information gathered can be stored and also used to enrich the whole.
 <br>
 <br>
 However, the conscious minds of most people are confined to communication via the intermediary of matter so that they can act as individuals and manipulate only what they are confined to experience. This allows them to develop in meaningful ways by competition and co-operation. It is no wonder that our scientists have been deceived for so long into believing that matter is all that exists!
 <br>
 <br>
 Such a speculation is supported by the evidence of psi which has been accumulating for more than a century and which is now gaining acceptance as scientific fact awaiting theoretical explanation. The "Scole Report" of the Society for Psychical Research by Keen(10) et al is proof of this and well worthy of study. Amazing phenomena are reported: all totally impossible from the viewpoint of established physics but explicable from the new standpoint unveiled. The speculation advanced here provides a hypothesis permitting most so-called psychic phenomena, to be explained as potentially real effects from an enhanced and extended base of theoretical physics. Until a theory is established for explaining the phenomena of psi it will continue to be regarded as a threat to be discredited and ignored.
 <br>
 <br>
 Telepathy can now be attributed to controlled leaks in the information filter-barriers of two apparently separated individuals. The same can be expected between minds of the living and the deceased: so explaining mental mediumship. Water divining will also require such a leak. Here the sensitive is permitted direct access to the memory banks of the i-ther. Indeed, almost the entire spectrum encompassing psi phenomena can be explained as potentially real effects. These are considered in detail in this author's publications(4),(

Failure to Rebut
<br>
<br>
Some of the giants of close-minded skepticism and materialism from the US, Australia and the UK contacted me primarily about the empirical evidence for the afterlife. Not one of the closed minded skeptic and scientists was able to legitimately and properly refute, rebut or negate the objective evidence I am presenting for the existence of the afterlife and for many aspects of psychic phenomena. I state that a few of these so called materialists actually make money or gain power and status from being anti-psychic. Others use their anti-psychic propaganda to promote their own careers - especially careers in Psychology or in some other academic field.
<br>
<br>
When Professor P Davies, the physicist who had a couple of best sellers on the New York list, imputed in the Sydney Morning Herald that he did not find any aspect of psychic phenomena valid I wrote to him and asked what aspects of psychic phenomena he had investigated and on what basis he had found them not to valid. I stated that as a psychic researcher of many years I, together with some of the world's greatest scientists who ever lived on this planet Earth did find validity in psychic phenomena. I received a reply that my query would be dealt with in the near future. Two years later I still have not had a reply! It would appear that even academics sell their principles for money or power or status! This professor was awarded a relatively huge grant by a religious organisation to continue to promote blind faith and irrational dogmaticisms.
<br>
<br>
But truth will out! With absolute certainty, truth will hit them in the face for their exploiting their position to promote darkness. A huge price will have to be paid for actually causing the darkness. It is not so much those who live in darkness that are liable but those who cause the darkness who have to pay a huge price. No one escapes the inevitability of the Law of Cause and Effect.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONSERVATIVE SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS ADMIT PARANORMAL TO BE ABSOLUTELY VALID! Reason why closed minded skeptics are so quiet about one of the most important psychic phenomena in HISTORY. Zwinge Randi, Sherman, Wiseman, Blackmore and those other aggressive CSICOP closed minded skeptics have been as quiet as a mouse and made to look rather ridiculous! And if science has confirmed one aspect of psychic phenomena to be valid, genuine and acceptable THEN ALL OTHER PSI empirically produced results as presented by some of the most brillinat minds on earth inevitably are valid and have to be accepted as genuine. Because this Russian girl with X-Ray vision is performing 'extra-natural', paranormal phenomenon has stunned the most hardened conservative scientists! Natalia Demkina has been very closely studied by Russian, English, American and other doctors and scientists and ALL stated that her paranormal is genuine!!!!!
<br>
<br>
Girl with X-ray Vision
<br>
Natalia Demkina, a 17 year old Russian girl caused a sensation with she appeared on British TV last week. Faced with four total strangers she correctly described their medical conditions including the fact that one of the test patients had only one kidney. The show's resident doctor Chris Steele admitted "My skepticism has waned. I have been very impressed. I've talked to a couple of the patients. Natalia has been spot on".

I know what you mean.  I was reading a Psychology journal article about kids who have memories of a past life.  One child knew things in striking detail since he told the parents of his "past life" what happened to "him".  However, the psychologist concluded it must be because the child is different (psychologically) to other 'normal' children.  It said nothing in the conclusion about researching further how he knew what he knew (normally in academic articles there is a clause stating a need for further research) and why.  Just that he was psychologically different.  The psychologist needs to read my sig instead of looking at the original version of it (simple solution = most likely).

Well, who says OBEs can't be triggered by an outside stimulus?
<br>
<br>
The findings do, however, revolve around subjective descriptions of the phenomenon, much like the actual OBEs people have described.
<br>
The shortening of the subject's legs, mentioned in the quoted article, has no significant bearing on the vweracity of the OBE-like experience since a) the shortening was observed after a the leading question of watching one's legs and the as yet unproven state of OBE as opposed to the possible hypnagogic state induced by the stimulus.
<br>
<br>
If the brain is seens as an interface device to another mode of existence than poking the brain would not really tell much except that the radio was intentionally broken.
<br>
<br>
More research, perhaps we will be vindicated, if that's what we really need.

Hi Folks,
<br>
My feel on this is thus:
<br>
<br>
How can you have a true measurable scientific experiment with one patient? What ever happened to multiple groups or even control groups?
<br>
A "scientist" and I would include Neurologists among this group, I work with a couple, can only validate what they can see, measure, weigh, touch, or smell. I've never seen an x-ray machine on the Astral Plane.
<br>
<br>
I think that the scientific method can be applied to the Astral World but do we really want to? I enjoy being able to interact with realms that operate via different rules than what our Physical Universe or at least what we think we know of our Universe. Lets not forget that our species has only been on this planet for a very short time, a blink of the eye in the big scale of things.
<br>
<br>
It wasn't that long ago that Swiss Neurologists might have told you that the Earth was flat and that there is know reason  for further exploration.
<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is be careful of "Published Findings" and don't forget that there are more testimonials that support a different view of OBE than that given by our friendly scientists. If the Neurologists were so sure that the Physical brain alone is the cause of OBE then why do they continue experimenting? But just in case, Where can I get a set of these electric probes? Sounds fun......

<section>
There is no single spot in the brain for inducing OBE's.   In general, temporal lobe epilepsies, electrical or magnetic stimulation of the temporal lobe, and dissociative drugs (such as ketamine and DXM) are means for inducing OBE's, but bear in mind that OBE's are simply experiences that have their foundation in brain function.  I have experienced OBE's but know for a fact that the experience was created by my brain.   The OBE experience is all in your head.  To believe that you're actually being transported out of your body is a mistake because your body is just a mental construct of your brain as well.

Also, as being part of your body (and your perceptual environment), your physical brain is a mental construct too, because you perceive it through its own sensory mechanisms. (Just make a hole in your skull and take a look at your visual cortex with the help of a mirror.)

"Notice the external white-lined shape is like an egg. Inside, almost
<br>
at the centre, is the toroidal shape of the Hippocampus-Amygdala
<br>
combined fields, the red contours. The central tube-like "sausage
<br>
with trumpet-like open ends" looks like what? Anyone? (Chorus: "An
<br>
Einstein-Rosen Bridge!" Right!
<br>
<br>
The blue-green combined field of the Thalamus-Hypothalamus-
<br>
Pituitary-Pineal glands forms a sausage, like a mini hyperspace
<br>
tunnel, about 7cm long. The screen image is magnified, but the actual
<br>
side is about 7cm, (reflecting) the normal brain size.
<br>
<br>
Let me pause as minute. Can we replay that part? Thanks. Notice
<br>
how the overall geometry is an ellipsoidal prolate spheroidal
<br>
cavity containing a sub-space of a toroid traversed by a hyperbolic,
<br>
non-linear Einstein-Rosen bridge. Again, in American lingo, "an
<br>
egg-shaped cavity containing a doughnut crossed by a sausage".
<br>
<br>
What do these nested fields look like to you, dear friends? (Cross
<br>
talk and comments). A topological analogue of a relativistic,
<br>
locally curved space-time locus around a solar system. Of course!
<br>
<br>
What else? A space-time torus with an Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting
<br>
its median points!
<br>
<br>
There, ladies and gentlemen...there is the scientific proof that
<br>
the motto of our Order, the dictum of the ancient sages, "As Above,
<br>
So Below ... As Within, So Without" is scientifically and
<br>
neurophysiologically correct and precisely so! These shapes which you
<br>
all recognise as hyperspatial four-dimensional plots, are indeed
<br>
magnetic-acoustical resonance chambers. Notice that these amazing
<br>
geometries are the synergistic effect of the magnetic fields of these
<br>
six organs surrounded by the ventricles, under the roof of the choroid
<br>
plexus and corpus callosum.
<br>
<br>
Notice what happens if I subtract the field of even a single organ,
<br>
let's say the pineal gland. See how it changes the entire structure?13
<br>
And, if I add the contribution of the mamillary body, it only widens
<br>
the tube, right? And if we add the field from the reticular formation,
<br>
the master circuit network, relay and switchboard of the brain where
<br>
all waves are originated, what do we get? Next frame, please? We get
<br>
a tunnel merging with the main ellipsoidal field. In the screen, it is
<br>
the orange coloured grid.
<br>
<br>
To summarize, what is our Mid-Brain or Inner Cavity? It is a
<br>
relativistic spatio-temporal cavity with local enfolded hyperspatial
<br>
bridges that undergoes harmonic resonances to magnetic and acoustical
<br>
stimuli. The implications are almost astronomical - may use the term,
<br>
because a model and mechanism based on this novel scientific information
<br>
implies that our human brain is in reality none other than a biological
<br>
space-time energy transducer.
<br>
<br>
As such, it creates not only space, but also time. Our ancient Chinese
<br>
ancestors maintained that "the Tao was in our head", in other words,
<br>
all the Universe was in our head!
<br>
<br>
My own inference from this study is that space and time are
<br>
essentially biologically modulated, perhaps even formulated, for my
<br>
equations show that possibility. Should this intuitive scientific
<br>
insight be correct, then it would demolish physics, biology,
<br>
philosophy and theology in a single, clean blow."

<br>
To believe you are being transported out of your body is a mistake, yes. But the real reason is because "you" are
<u>
 never
</u>
in your physical body in the first place. The feeling that you are is simply an illusion.
<br>
<br>
I often feel if people would only realise this one fact then a lot of other stuff would begin falling into place. The mind and the brain are two separate entities with a bio-magnetic link and lock mechanism which couples them. Rather like a television and a broadcasting station with a high-frequency radio link that couples the two. The mind is the broadcasting station, the television receiver is the brain and the radio signal is the energetic link. But our case is slightly different as the physical body also transmits from its own sensory mechanisms back down the link to the mind.
<br>
<br>
The explanation regarding the science experiments is really very simple. All they are doing is disturbing the transmission path between non-physically located mind, and physically located brain. When that path is disturbed, you suddenly feel disassociated from your physical body because the transmission has, to a degree, lost its bio-magnetic lock. Obviously, then, you will get a sensation of no-longer being energetically linked to your physical body. So, hey presto, you have an out of body experience which you relate to the surgeon afterwards...

 and because no-one fully understands what is happening
</i>
... they all put two and two together and make fifty five.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
That's why I cannot help but agree with these scientists who scoff at the idea of a person being able to somehow climb out of their physical body, and start walking about the place. I think it was the William Bulman book that had a picture of a person on the cover supposedly stepping out of their physical body. Really, it's laughable to suggest that would be possible. It isn't. You can't step out of your physical body. There is absolutely no mechanism in the brain which will allow you to do so. And anyone who would say it is impossible, is absolutely 100% correct... but for all the wrong reasons.
<br>
<br>
The key is to realise that "you" are never "in" your physical body in the first place.

Maybe the mind will never get out, as you say. Maybe what happens it is just our attentaion being focus on another level, on another reality, but maybe, when that change of atention happens, a flux of energy may occur. That flux or whatecer you wanna call it, it is what we call "soul".

Dr D:   Ladies and gentlemen, I trust you are all fulfilled now, and

since I have been "interrogated" repeatedly by many of our distinguished
<br>
guests, I hereby make the official announcement that Chicago-style pizza
<br>
and beer will be served on Friday night only. We don't want any
<br>
casualties before our important Solstice events (boos and multi-lingual

FDA are secretly preparing a campaign to target any unorthodox method
<br>
of diagnosis, such as alternative medicine, kinesiology/muscle testing
<br>
and radionics - even by licensed chiropractors, etc.
<br>
<br>
Also, all devices using light, sound or EM frequencies in any way that
<br>
alter brainwaves will be declared illegal.(1)  This includes all
<br>
subliminal music, hypnosis, meditation tapes and self-help modalities.
<br>
You should know that ahead of time, because they have sophisticated
<br>
electronic technology to detect where, how and who is using these
<br>
devices, and possibly raid them or confiscate them. Be aware and know
<br>
about it now.
<br>
<br>
Ms.Dr. C:  Will they also be targeting private individuals using
<br>
brainwave altering props, techniques, etc?
<br>

Well since that CLEARLY isn't gonna happen it just goes right with my theory of it all being a hoax.

Do ye think the article is a hoax as I can't stop thinking about it.
<br>
<br>
Sorry, just that I took a year off school and haven't been working for 4 months and have been doing nothing during the day and have just been thinking about Life all the time.....for 4 months non stop. And this theory has been in my mind most of the time, I think the reason I can't get it out of my mind is cos all of the spare time I have, and ya know, I say too much thinking can only be bad for you, WAY too much thinking like.
<br>
<br>
Like the implications of it demolishing physics, biology, theology and philosophy, I find that very disturbing.
<br>
<br>
and if all of the universe is in the brain, and it creates space/time (as the article says the brain is a space/time energy transducer) does that mean the core of the brain is free of space and time and it is actual immortal? And do you think intelligence would have been required for the brain to be a space/time transducer? Like space/time is all the stuff in the physical dimensions, and the 5th dimension and Spirit World are all non physical so I think when the brain dies it leaves the physical behind it and goes back to the non physical as the brain creates space/time.
<br>
<br>
But once again, if the brain creates space does that mean that the ACTUAL core of the brain is non-physical as it CREATES space which points to IT not being physical and therefore immortal, yet they measured it like it was ENTIRELY physical the way they pointed it out in the experiment, like if the brain dies, does that mean you will be dead? Yet I know that there are non-physical realms and I know that something which created the brain which in turn creates space/time is EXTREMELY intelligent and that something IS in non-physical realms, right? obviously.
<br>
<br>
Like WE DON'T know how to create space/time, and it is being created in the brain, so this points to the brain being seperate from our personality and thoughts and memories. And we aren't clever enough (if reproduction can't according to the theory) to create the brain, so, if humans can't then only a higher being can. Like if the brain ends, then it MUST have had a beginnig, as it is not eternal, and for something to have a beginning it MUST have a cause, and for something that is intelligent enough to create nature, sure wouldn't make Like worthless.
<br>
<br>
Like I KNOW there is an Afterlife, all humans believe in God, it is in our nature, and that shows that there is God in all of us, if humans weren't put up to scientific scrutiny, or fellas making money of religion or materialistic science, we would know there is such thing as God, it is built in in us. Like Science tried to disprov God with the big bang etc, that is why the clever human after a while subconsciously question if there is such thing as God, but if we we're wild and there was no materialistic scientists or religionists around then it would be default to believe in God, cos that would JUST BE the way, to know that it (or Great Spirit, as it has no gender) is there.
<br>
<br>
Like I know if I had a astral experience it would totally evaporate all these fears as the astral realm is real, in fact more real than physical dimensions, but since I didn't experience it yet part of my mind lingers about it subconsciously yet I know it is real, you know what I mean.
<br>
<br>
same with the theory from trufax, I know it is false, I shout it out yet my mind just won't let it go, even though it is is 10 years old (the article) and I have not heard a bit until the person on here posted it. Like the quotes I pointed out point to it being insane, and 90% of me accepts that, but the other part of my mind won't let me free knowing that these people have supposedly discovered something like this, somthing which demolishes physics, philosophy, biology and theology in a single clean blow.
<br>
<br>
Like I see genuised talking about philosophy yet these wackos in the article have supposedly discovered something that would just blatantly demolish that, just doesn't make sense.
<br>
<br>
Like surely the genuises would know if the brain was a space/time transducer.
<br>
<br>
Anyway thanks for Astral Pulse to allow a forum for me to post my opinions on.
<br>
<br>
And thank you for reading this.

"The mind and the brain are two separate entities with a bio-magnetic link and lock mechanism which couples them. Rather like a television and a broadcasting station with a high-frequency radio link that couples the two. The mind is the broadcasting station, the television receiver is the brain and the radio signal is the energetic link."
<br>
<br>
That fills me up with a theory, if in the article of magnetics components of brain activity, do you think that:
<br>
<br>
if the brain is the receiver, then it would obviously show the universe where it is RECEIVING the message, like a TV shows a channel, but not where it originates, as the TV channel originates from the signal. ie The Mind.
<br>
<br>
so about the universe being in the head, in the astral realm, there is the akashic records, which holds any event future or past, and if the mind sees that, it is linked to the brain (like when the brain dies the mind goes away) so it would broadcast the signal to the TV (ie the brain) and the brain would be the hardcopy, which would contain all the memories temporarily (not forever), but only put them out on a physical level appearingly as only the five physical senses can sense the memories.
<br>
<br>
Also, does quantum physics teach that the brain is nothing but a hologram, so the about the universe being in the head, it could just be an illusion of the way the brain interprets reality, like the fish in the tank, only looking through one camera, or else it could be the experimenters wishes to see that, and you know mind over matter, so he could change that and think that a einstein rosen bridge is in the head.
<br>
<br>
BTW, i've a 134 IQ and a EXTREMELY open mind, so I would be thinking of new stuff all the time, so I think in time the stuff about the universe in the head will EVENTUALLY be disproved, like in 2 millenia, as if it has ever been proved though, like the webpage I sawit on was 10 years old and was in a article where everyone is insane but it's the implication of the theory that makes me frightened of it and make me, whether I want to or not, believe in it, even though it would be saying the scientists in it are wackos in voice, but on a more mental level, I feel I may have been scarred.

When I was studying the Japanese language, I would frequently have OBEs, I'd find myself face in book- pen in hand while sitting at a desk.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the right angular gyrus plays a role in language learning, from what I have found out. So I figured learning languages might help induce them. Perhaps that is why certain Mantras play a part in OBEs.

Robert Monroe, one of America's forefathers on OBE research worked at a broadcasting station, and I believe that the radio frequency radiation may have played a part in his frequent OBEs. Though he never mentioned that as a possible source.
<br>
<br>
And most people today carry a cell phone, and they put it near their right ear when speaking, perhaps RF could be affecting the right angular gyrus.

None of the testimonials regarding Natalia Demkina can be thought of as scientific valid until she submits to a double-blind test.  I don't believe any of her tests so far have gone this far--completely disconnecting the subject from the tester, and recording both hits and misses during the test.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't take media testimonials too seriously.  It's all about the ratings.

 I wonder, Supplemental Iron can be moved by an electromagnetic field, so if we used a pulsing electromagnet near the right angular gyrus, would the iron in the body collect in that area making a type of connection that would induce an OBE?
 <br>
 <br>
 I am right now using the Hyper-Dimensional Resonator (pulsing electromagnet) right above my right ear, instead of at the navel. Earlier I did this and then went and laid down, I noticed an immediate sinking sensation with lots of hypnogogic visuals. I'll let you know how it turns out.

I was reading this topic and I just had to start this thread back up. Sorry
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
So in regards to out of body experiences being dismissed as being purely created by the physical brain alone and nothing else, how do we explain Monroe's students who were able to interact with each other as a team when experimenting with this?
<br>
<br>
Sure you can say that they were all a bunch of liars and that it never happened, but then you have to ask yourself what their motivation is for lying?
<br>
<br>
It basically comes down to what you believe to be true, but I myself have read almost all of Monroe's material and he seemed perfectly sane and so did his students. I know Monroe had nothing to gain from going public with all of this at the time that he did. He was already a successful business man who had everything he needed.
<br>
<br>
What about the Lifeline program where people were able to get information from people who had died and then validate the information.
<br>
<br>
I believe that Monroe was being honest.
<br>
<br>
What about things that you see in the astral plane that you have never seen before in waking life? Where does all of this information come form? Thin air? What's thin air? Would we call thin air the astral plane? There has to be a source for all of this information that people pull out of their you know what. For example at the Monroe Institute they have real live recordings of people talking through a monitor while out of there body. Sometimes relaying information from beings on the other side. The things they said were profound, and most of these people were not philosophers, they were just average Joes. So where did all of these profound speeches they recorded come from? Science can't explain it at the moment.
<br>
<br>
There are simply too many things that point toward a reality in which the brain and the mind are separate.
<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't care if a scientist is hell bent of not believing in life after death etc... I will prove it to myself and live a life of peace and hope that one day the scientists join me.
<br>
<br>
Here's a final quote from one of the greatest scientist of the 20th century, who believed in more than the physical brain. You have to understand that there are good and bad scientists

People using the scientific method will discover the physical component and process of OBE or consciousness projection.

Discoveries and exploration of the astral and beyond is accomplished by the projected consciousness.

I'm sure they will, and it will be a true breakthrough and even more so if people realize that even though there is a physical component involved, there is much more that science can't see.

Very true, without the human left brain side it would be a different story. I don't think the explorative side dies with physical death however, there seems to be so much more. Stuff that I need to validate for myself.
<br>
<br>
Have you read any of Monroe's books? He speaks about NVC (Non Verbal Communication) which he describes as being an extremely efficient universal way of communicating.
<br>
<br>
He states:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">
 <cite>
  Quote
 </cite>
 We say that a picture is worth 1000 words, A color picture is worth 10000 words. A moving color picture is worth a 100000 or more words in the transmission of information and.or communication.
 <br>
 <br>
 NVC takes a quantum jump beyond moving color picture. It is direct instant experience and /or immediate knowing transmitted from one intelligent energy system and received by another.
