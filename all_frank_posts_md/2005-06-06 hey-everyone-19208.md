Hi Lewin, welcome to the forums

I listen to Enya and Secret Garden, but those are my choices and taste.

Take a look at our Astral FAQ, if you haven't already,

Welcome to the forums, sorry I can't help on that note, but you might try googling it. I'll try finding some and get back to you.

Hi Lewin,
<br>
<br>
Thanks for posting your introduction, and welcome!

<br>
<br>
While traditional AP can be difficult and elusive for a good many of us, there is another process called
<i>
 phasing
</i>
that I believe is more accessible. We have a member/moderator named Frank who has developed a model that puts nonphysical realities within reach of all of us. Please take a look at the topics around the forum by Frank. You may find the guidance and advice he offers helpful.
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick

I have tried googling it before, but most of the stuff you find you have to buy it. That makes it very hard for me.
<br>
<br>
I did find one free download on this site, but the CD only put me to sleep.

I will never leave... want to know why. I projected for 10 seconds last night!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
I had woken up at 4 in the morning because my mothers puppy was whining at my door. So I let him sleep with me. Well I went back to sleep when I started to here this strange noise. I didn't panic and pretty soon I felt weightless. So I tested my self by lifting my leg. I didn't feel any blankets. And then the puppy started barking and I lost it...
<br>
<br>
But that has given me the determination to try every night until I do it again!
