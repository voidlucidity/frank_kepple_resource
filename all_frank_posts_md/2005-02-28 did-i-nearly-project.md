Hello, I am new to these forums, so forgive me if I've posted in the wrong section.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would like to ask what you make of these experience I had last night:
<br>
<br>
I went to bed, and started using the mental falling method to reach a trance state, when I reached the state of numbness I decided to stay like that for about half an hour or so.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have never tried to project before, but I thought I'd try and lift my "astral head" out of my body - I started focusing totally on trying to lift it up, when I suddenly felt a big surge of energy go to my head, it felt as if I were physically straining myself, although my head had not moved.
<br>
<br>
My heart stating beating very fast, and I was using all my energy to try and lift my astral head, I felt as if my consciousness was trying to pull out my body then, I started hearing a loud hissing sound - at first I thought it was a car outside or something, but it started getting louder and at this point I honestly thought I was gonna black out so I stopped and got up, and the hissing immediately stopped.
<br>
<br>
I was quite shocked by this experience, I also noticed I was sweating on my palms after it. I would like to know what you all think of this experience, and could I have been close to projecting?
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance

Hehe,
<br>
<br>
I don't think there is one definate way of experiencing a projection. The last few nights i have experienced it in different ways, so i think you are doing pretty well to get to that stage.
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are getting very close

Hi:
<br>
<br>
All the sensations you describe are typical of conventional obe practice. Sounds like you were quite close but bottled out at the last minute. Fear tends to play a significant role at first. Takes you a while to get used to all the sensations.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
