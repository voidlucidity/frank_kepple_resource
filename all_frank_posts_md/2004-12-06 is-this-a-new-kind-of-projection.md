When i was about 13, i wasn't so much into metaphysical or paranormal studies. But one night, i fell asleep like i usually do and had the same dream that I've had quite often. It was a war dream where i was a soldier who had to carry a missile to my base. I carried the missile half way there but was shot in the field but before i fully took in the dream "death" i awoke. When i woke up, i saw myself. But i didn't see myself sleeping, i saw myself with my hands in the air as if i was holding a missile. Once the sight of my fully conscious self below me, i sorta..disappered..into my body. Throughout my life i have had experiences like this. Is this a new kind of projection? Maybe conscious projection? If you've got any info about this or even a name for it please let me know! Thanks

Hello:
<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like a lucid dream experience. You are technically "out of body" as these days the term has come to mean any experience where you find yourself mentally focussed anywhere but for the physical. But as for discovering a new kind of projection experience, from what you describe the short answer is, no. But keep trying and who knows, one day you may discover something no one else has.
