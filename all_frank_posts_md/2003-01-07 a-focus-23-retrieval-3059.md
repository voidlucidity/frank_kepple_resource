<section>
Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
I got a sudden urge to do a retrieval, in Focus 23 for some reason, and after placing the intent to be in the 3D blackness I just floated there, watching for any irregularity to appear. Almost straight ahead I noticed a tiny circle standing out from the rest of the blackness. It sparkled for a second and something about it just felt like a portal. I focused all of my attention on it and within the blink of an eye....I was still in blackness (lol). I assumed something had maybe backfired so I placed the intent to be in Focus 23 again and I was getting the same black surroundings (if I had taken just a moment to observe that blackness I found myself in, I would have known instantly that it wasn't the 3D blackness--it was a flat, dense black). I then felt/sensed someone over to my right and realized the 3D blackness portal had indeed done its job: I was in a very black, dark place, in Focus 23.
<br>
<br>
I then perceived this someone off to my right exclaiming something...and then talking rapidly as if angry or upset about something. I moved forward carefully as I sensed they did not know I was near. All I could 'see' was the kind of blackness that is produced when say, in a basement with no windows...or in a cave with no light source. When I could feel an older woman about twenty feet away from me I said a soft, "Hello?", and almost cringed when I could then hear her react to me by apparently stumbling over something. She seemed panicky as she crashed around what I then felt to be a small kitchen with an awful lot of stuff on the floor that confused me. She seemed to be surrounded by many objects that for some reason didn't make sense to me at first, especially some kind of barrier between the two of us...but I just let that feeling go as I hurried to reassure her I was someone she could trust. She immediately demanded to know how I got 'in here'. I scrambled to think of something and said I didn't know...I was lost and I needed her help. I told her I couldn't see anything, it was so dark. I then got the impression of a small kitchen type of room. A window was in the opposite wall behind her offering a faint bluish light. She was thinking, moving slightly and I was able to 'see' her as a black silouhette against the weak light. It hit me then what was going on with her. She was hiding in the dark, protecting herself, waiting to defend herself against certain individuals who had caused her a lot of terror for a long time. Something about her situation (just wondering for a second how lonely this existence must have been for her) got to me and I had to put a lid on my emotions as I raced through ideas on what to say next.
<br>
<br>
I told her my name, explaining she had nothing to fear from me...and for some reason I felt it necessary to ask why she had all the lights turned off. She became agitated again, and answered by saying that if the lights were on she'd have no way of knowing if 'they' were near. When it was dark she could see them. I felt an opportunity open and I told her, "Of course! I understand what you're doing. I've seen them too and I'm glad you figured out how to deal with them." This created a pause...and she then whispered, "You mean you see them too?" I could feel her high level of anxiety begin to melt away as I nodded. This was rather astonishing to her because no one had ever believed her, whenever she had tried to explain the many visits she'd received from strange, apparently 'unseen' individuals. No one had understood her need to protect herself, to be on guard constantly. I tried to reassure her that we were friends, that she could trust me...and as we were still surrounded in darkness I asked if she could just reach out and take my hand. I told her it was wonderful to find someone else who was 'just like me' and it would be comforting to hold her hand. She hesitated and then finally extended her left arm over what felt like a three foot high pile of stuff or barrier of some kind (it felt like it was a barrier for her), and grasped my hand. She had a strong grip. I held her hand in both of mine and thanked her, telling her I felt a lot better.
<br>
<br>
I asked her if she'd like to go someplace with me, a place where she would never have to worry about dangerous intruders ever again. She'd be able to have whatever life she wanted. She was unsure...asking how that could be as the tricksters (her word for them) were always able to find her. I explained a little more about Focus 27, and I suddenly knew she was feeling a fearful anxiousness over the thought of leaving her small strong-hold here...so I sent her PUL immediately. Her fear passed and she was calmer, still gripping my hand for dear life...and something interesting happened: I could suddenly see her face. A soft gold light seemed to surround her head, illuminating wild brown hair, a face younger than I had assumed, and blue watery eyes that looked as if they had seen more hell than most could ever dream of. I smiled at her, asking her to just leave with me to see this new world, adding that she could always come back here if she didn't like it there. I got the idea to see if I could somehow pick up on what would be her ideal home/environment, and saw a house out in a country setting. I asked if she would be interested in living in such a place and she stared at me, amazed. Yes, she would like that...but she was struggling to believe it could really happen. I then got a clear thought that she loved to fly and I told her I did too...that we could fly right out of here. And I instantly wondered if I had blown it. She looked at me as if I were under suspicion again. My ability to fly could mean I was a trickster too. She said one of them had taught her to fly (I'm sure she was talking about the OOBE) many years ago and she had figured out how to fly on her own and avoid their assistance. I wondered for a second whether that trickster had actually been someone trying to help her, when she was in the physical?
<br>
<br>
I asked again for her to just visit the new place and she decided to go...but not before she got her purse!---and she started to turn, pulling away. I didn't want to let go of her hand--I was afraid our rapport would be broken--but I had no choice. She retreated into the darkness, opening drawers, moving things around. I looked down and perceived what I guess were large, narrow, cardboard boxes...arranged with other objects that made up a kind of barrier about two feet wide and running the length of her room. I looked back up toward where I thought she was, when it was obvious she'd found her purse, and she then seemed to freeze in motion. I could feel she was suddenly panicky over the idea of leaving this place, scared, uncertain...so I sent her more PUL. I could feel her awareness of me return and she walked quietly back to where I was standing...looking kind of shocked but indicating she would go. She then said I had to wait a moment and she began to carefully move a section of her cardboard barrier, creating an opening for herself to pass through to my side. She deliberately closed it back up with equal care as if this would guarantee her little kitchen would remain safe while she was gone. She believed this barrier had protected her all this time and was completely convinced it would continue to do its job. I felt tears come to my physical eyes but ignored them as I took her arm, telling her that for some magical reason I could see her now, and that I just knew the tricksters could not see us. She glanced around and tried to smile, concerned she was in the middle of some kind of escape that could end badly.
<br>
<br>
We started walking into the dark...and soon we were in a place that was filled with nothing but light, everywhere. Before she had a chance to react to the change a woman appeared ahead of us. My lady stopped, staring at her, dumbfounded, and then they reached out and hugged each other. I stood there for a few moments and finally felt it was best I leave them alone. They were still holding one another in a tight embrace and the woman who had greeted us gave me a brief smile and a knowing feeling that all was well now. I could go if I wanted. I thanked her, looked at my friend one last time (I think they had been sisters) and returned to C1.
<br>
<br>
Phew!
<br>

Much love,
<br>

Hephaestus,
<br>
<br>
The impression I got was that she had possibly suffered from classic schizophrenia while in the physical. Whether during that physical life she was seeing what many believe are only hallucinations, or real afterlife manifestations, I don't know. When she died, for some reason, her fears rendered her stuck. She was still believing that she was actually alive and having to continue dealing with that situation. As to the tricksters, I don't really know whether they were creations of her own fear and anxiety, or perhaps guides, deceased family members...and her own fear-based beliefs misinterpreted who they really were?

<section>
Ginny,
<br>
<br>
I have only just begun to use some of the techniques you use. Nothing too great to report on yet. I just bought some of the Moen institute CD's and Im VERY excited to start using them.
<br>
<br>
Just based on the post you put up about the techniques and "placing your intent" I tryed just imagining talking with one of my good friends who tragically took his own life a few years ago. I can remember that he did say some things I wasnt imagining in the conversation, but I lost them after I fell back to sleep. Very interesting though.
<br>
<br>
Thank you again for your excellent posts, and wish me luck!

When you talk about Focus 23 thru 27, is the training for these focus levels available on any Monroe tapes/cds? I am using the Gateway Voyage series, on tape II now, and I see they go up to Focus 21. Is the only way to work past Focus 21 to take the program on site at the Monroe Institute? Thanks.

Hi Pete,
<br>
<br>
You're going to have to contact TMI regarding what level their home series tapes now take a person. I used them in the late 80's when F12 was the ultimate. What ended up working for me was discovering two years ago that although hemi-sync, tapes and the like are great, they aren't necessary to learn to how to focus one's attention away from the physical and into alternate realities. You may want to check out Bruce Moen's website, where he explains what he learned and now teaches: Focused Attention (which is what I do to explore and retrieve in the nonphysical).
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/index.html
</a>
<br>
He attended TMI three times and knew Bob Monroe well...all of which got my attention back then as I respected Monroe and his work a great deal. Focused Attention is all about becoming reacquainted with and utilizing abilities we already possess, to shift one's attention into other realms.
<br>
In reading Bruce Moen's books, I realized I didn't need anything outside of myself in order to, say, go to Focus 27---that I was already 'hard wired' so to speak to explore the nonphysical...that I could in a relaxed state just place the intent and be There.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps and Happy Trails,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

Jerry,
<br>
<br>
A friend of mine had a similar situation and nothing this person did seemed to convince the nonphysical person to take a hike (he wasn't a beneficial guide or friend, he was a pest). Even visiting with the Non (another retriever and I) in the nonphysical didn't help much because he was so addicted to physical reality---it was almost impossible to get his attention. What did finally work was my friend realizing that, first of all, the Non had no power over her (only HER beliefs to the contrary gave the Non any kind of 'power'), and secondly, when she started bringing into her awareness the *feeling* of love (easy way to do this is to remember a time when you felt love for someone, a pet etc... or loved by another---and feel that love--it can't be intellectualized, you must actually feel it) the Non just left her life. And while experiencing moments of feeling the energy of love (when she was aware of the Non's presence) she also mentally told the Non to look around, see others there who'd most likely wanted to communicate with him, and so on. Have no idea if the Non left because he finally became aware of others or more than just his own addiction to the physical or not, but I do know that the energy of love opens perception, for those of us in the physical as well as anyone in the nonphysical.
<br>
<br>
Jerry...are some of your visitors operating under loving intentions? A good rule of thumb to go by is if any Non ever wants a person to do or believe anything they don't want to do or believe...ignore (as you've been doing) and the above info has been known to work well---at least for the people in the physical I've known and worked with. Nons are addicts...confused, still believing they're alive in the physical and desperately trying to continue with such beliefs. This is not to say it's an easy situation you have going for you, but I hope this helps.
<br>
<br>
Much love,
<br>
<br>
Ginny

Are you talking about the method I use to explore the nonphysical, Focused Attention? Yea, such exploring is all 'within'. Our 'minds' are, I believe, a part of or always connected to all of consciousness and the realities created within it, whether it be this reality we call the physical or any number of alternate realities we're 'aware of'. And some people just have a more open link, so to speak, such as what you've experienced. Cool!---:o)

Ginny,
<br>
<br>
Your posts have inspired me to where I'm now on Bruce Moen's second book. Maybe I'll give it a try at some point. Right now I seem to be learning the phasing process thanks to posts by Frank. From some correspondence with him, it seems what I've been experiencing so far have me at least at Focus 12. Today, in addition to those swirling colors (there was a beautiful bluish purple one) and patterns, I got the sensation of forward movement. I also saw a gray and whitish image of a scene in the distance that stayed for a while. So hopefully, I'm on the right track.
<br>
<br>
Hope to read more of the retrievals that you're doing.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Hi Nick,
<br>
<br>
Good to hear about your progress (isn't it fun and exciting?) and I'll be posting another retrieval soon. Every now and then having to earn a living seems to get in my way (arrgh!), but retrieving is something I'll always do.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and talk with you soon.

Really good question. From my limited experience I've run across people in the afterlife who'd suffered from 'mental illness' and ended up stuck in Focus 23 as that lady had been. A few others were in worlds within the Belief System Territories. Some never really got stuck anywhere and appeared to be fine. It all depends on one's strong beliefs/desires. She was stuck in Focus 23 thinking she was still alive. I personally feel that we really know very little about 'mental illness', what it truly involves. Perhaps these cases demonstrate a greater capacity for some to be in-tune with the nonphysical, and because of society's misunderstanding of this there's a great deal of fear attached to it...rendering the recipient even more suffering? So many ancient cultures revered members with such abilities and their experiences were often not negative.

Hi Ginny !
<br>
<br>
Just wanted to echo your thoughts on mental illness - I also think we know far less about this subject than we think. From the perspective of experiencing astral projection, many symptoms of mental illness take on new meaning.
<br>
<br>
I think that there are a fair few people on this forum that hold this point of view aswell.

Clandestino,

Yes, my mother had what is known as schizophrenia, years ago. And yep, there was the classic paranoia, the confusion on and off (especially after she was introduced to the drugs used back then--but her doctors were only trying to help with a situation that even to this day remains a mystery)...but curiously, she stood out as a guide/teacher of the paranormal, someone who told others to question all things (especially popular belief systems) and seek truth through experience! I couldn't have asked for a better teacher---:o).
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your kind words, Clandestino, and much love...
<br>
<br>
Ginny

I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a form of schizophrenia that includes the symptoms of schizophrenia with bi-polar mood swings.  I'm on anti-psychotic and mood stabalizing medications.  It has been such a difficult illness to deal with.  I've already been hospitalized three times now at a short-term hospital, and I'm only 17.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wonder if there are spiritual aspects to the illness.  At times voices tell me to stop taking my medications because I'm a great psychic, but I'm reluctant to trust it, as I know grandiosity comes with this illness, and I've had problems with that....
<br>
<br>
I've heard that people with mental illness are often very intelligent and sensitive (I am.)  And like your mother, I'm interested in the paranormal, believe that reasoning and experience is the best source of truth, and I question and criticize belief systems, especially popular ones, and religion.
<br>
