When I had the OBE at this link, I took the awareness that I met to be "GOD" but today I wonder if it wasn't the conscious collective of mankind. Perhaps the conscious collective of those who have lived before us? I don't know what it was for sure, but it sure seemed like some kind of God awareness to me:

This experience had nothing to do with drugs of any kind, I had not taken any kind of drug other than Aspirin my entire life when this happened.

It might have been the conscious collective of all mankind throughout all time, which includes us. If you put them all together like the cells in a brain the sum is more than its parts, god like.
<br>
<br>
What it was is speculation on my part, I don't know, but I sure thought it was god and knew that I was just as much it as it was me, and everyone else too.
<br>
<br>
I will go ahead and cut and paste here:
<br>
<br>
One warm afternoon in 1996 I took a short nap.  I awoke within it to find myself standing in the presence of a huge sun or sphere of light and I quickly learned that this sun was pure consciousness and awareness. Although its surface was only swirling light and did not have a face, it seemed as if it was smiling at me and had nothing but love for me.
<br>
<br>
I felt its thoughts as one with my own and felt it peering deeply into my own awareness, knowing everything about me all at once. Standing in its presence I was overcome by a deep sense of awe and at the same time I was surprised to find myself so fully conscious in this empty, but light-filled void. There was nothing in existence for me but myself and this sun smiling its awareness at me.  It was unlike any place on earth, and yet as real as waking reality.  In fact, it was more real; I was super-conscious.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly I came to a profound awareness that this sun was God!  I was so overwhelmed and surprised that God was real that I gasped and then yelled out, "You're Real!"  I had always had a deep mistrust of religion.  Years before this experience, I had decided for many seemingly valid reasons that religion and God were only a product of the human mind, yet there I was standing in the presence of what I knew without a doubt was God. What I had previously thought to be the truth about the universe was shattered and I stood there stunned, having had my world turned around so quickly.
<br>
<br>
I was happy because I had always hoped that God was real and that there was a future beyond the physical. As I stood in its presence, I perceived myself to be nothing but pure awareness and without a body.  This sun of awareness fully merged with me, seeing everything inside of me.  It saw everything I had ever done (and failed to do) both good and bad, and yet I did not sense or feel this Being was judging me or my past. There was no serial or motion-picture-like review of my life, just a sudden and full knowing about all things I have ever done, thought and experienced.
<br>
<br>
Because this sun of awareness/God was peering so fully and deeply into me, I felt totally naked, more naked than if I were standing without clothes in front of a million people. This Being seemed to be the consciousness of everyone I had ever known plus that of millions of others.  It seemed to be everyone, but incredible as it might seem, most of all it seemed to be me.
<br>
<br>
Even though I had no awareness of having a body, this feeling of nakedness was more than I could stand.  Before I had time to think about what I was doing, I began moving away from this Being as fast as I could. It wasn't that I was afraid, nor that I wanted to get away from this wonderful sun of light, it was more like an automatic response to feeling more naked than I thought naked could be.
<br>
<br>
As I was traveling away from this Being I found myself bursting through some kind of barrier into a blackness that was filled with wonderful stars; space.  As I continued moving forward at a tremendous speed through the star fields, I soon found myself slowing down as if I was up against another barrier or membrane.  It seemed to stretch slightly and then I burst through it into another blackness of star-filled space.
<br>
<br>
I continued to speed away faster and faster, but regardless of how much physical distance I traveled, I was never any farther away from the sun of awareness at all.  I quickly traveled through several star-filled spaces, at least six of them beyond the great sphere of light, each separated from one another by barriers that I was easily penetrating.  As I passed through each layer, my speed increased each time, but its consciousness was still with me.  It was still deeply within my own consciousness.
<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, I fell through the top of my bedroom ceiling, hit my body with a jolt and immediately woke up.  The jolt was so strong that my bed physically bounced as my body jerked awake in response to the sudden stop.  I opened my eyes and immediately spoke in a low and powerful voice, "I am that great I am."  I said this almost involuntarily; the words spilled out of my mouth without even thinking about what or why I was saying it. I also knew what this meant: that I was the very consciousness that I was trying to get away from!
<br>
<br>
As much as I tried to get away from that Sun of Awareness, I could never get one fraction of an inch farther away from it, no matter how far or fast I traveled.  Even after waking up, it was still with me. To this day, I still feel and know its presence. I believe that this Sun/Intelligence/God wasn't a single Being, but is the center of all beings, that it is me, you and perhaps all conscious beings.
<br>
<br>
From this experience I think that somewhere at the center of each of us is a spark of this same light, and without it we would not have consciousness, and  perhaps without us it would not exist either. As I was flying away from this being, I had the impression that I was traveling through several layers within a sphere, but I was bursting through layers like the layers of an onion but between each layer was star-filled space. I can't really tell you if I was traveling from the inside out, or the outside in, but as I traveled through them I had an impression that the farther I got from the sphere of light, the smaller I got and the more divided I became.
<br>
<br>
Because of this experience, I came to see everyone around me as myself.  At the same time, I also see this as equally true from everyone else's perspective, that I am them too. They too can look around and only see other parts of themselves, other selves experiencing life from another point of view, separated by their physical bodies and world, by their individual minds and wills, but in reality they are one at their core.
<br>
<br>
These feelings and thoughts were so strong within me that I had trouble referring to other people at work as anything other than "I."  I had a tendency to think about others as just another part of myself. Just as I think about my hands as being a part of me, I would sometimes refer to others as "I" instead of the name of the person. For example, instead of saying, "He had finished working on that project" it came out as "I had finished working on that project."  I had to re-learn how to refer to others as separate from myself. After four years, I still think of others as myself, but now I can stop from verbalizing it.
<br>
<br>
If I had the chance to do it over again and stand in the presence of this sun-intelligence-God, I wouldn't run away from it no matter how startling it is to be seen to such depth. I now hope that I would stand in its presence no matter how naked I felt. I don't believe that my motive for running was because I couldn't stand to face the light, or that I felt like a bad person, but because I was so unaccustomed to being seen so fully, so suddenly, so clearly and to such depth. Unfortunately my flight away from it took place before I could think of what I was doing and why.
<br>
<br>
The words I spoke after the experience, "I am that great I am" meant that, although I am individual here, I am also a part of every other consciousness at the great central point of consciousness; God. I am now secure in the knowledge that this presence of consciousness has always been with me, and that I have never been alone and never will be alone. I now know that this presence is closer to me than anything else in the universe. I had been so accustomed to it that I didn't know it was there, much like becoming used to a smell in a room, once you are there with it long enough, it begins to fade into the background. Like silence, it is always there, maybe in the background, behind and between the sounds, but always there.

I exerpted this experience that I'm sharing from a book I've written. You all can copy it of course. I wasn't sure to put the copyright, but I did since I copied it straight from there.
<br>
<br>
Today, like you, I've started to feel that maybe it was not THE Source, but A source, like a greater Source Self, or the Source Self for all of earth or something. But it could be just our human side doubting the magnificance of what we did, and what we experienced.
<br>
<br>
This experience of mine happened in September of 2002. I remember reading Christopher's experience, maybe a few years ago, and I was a bit skeptical. But now...

 An Introduction to Out-of-body Experiences

"This was a period of my life when I needed some support... some love... To know that there is something greater to which I am a part... To have some positive reinforcement that the purposes I've dedicated my life to are real and valid... To know that everything is OK and all right.
<br>
"I'd just finished reading the Thiaoouba Prophecy so I sought to find two things: The Source and The Thiaooubans.
<br>
"I kneeled down on both knees and put my palms to the floor, and I placed my forehead to the back of my hands. I went within and without, seeking the Source. Almost immediately before me materialized a star, but this star- rather than radiating heat and light- radiated love and acceptance. There were tangible rays of love and acceptance that penetrated my very being. They/It touched upon every facet of me... every frequency upon which I exist. The Source's love and acceptance penetrated and suffused all me- my physical body, etheric body, astral body, etc... Every part of me, every emotion, every drive, every hope- they were all loved fully and completely... accepted fully and completely.
<br>
"The love and acceptance were so complete and so true that I cried tears of joy. They streamed in rivers down my face in a great release, and I knew/know that everything is all right. I knew/know that... there IS something greater, and I am a part of it, and loved by it, and that I never have to be alone.
<br>
"The Source looked to be composed of short filaments of love and acceptance. It was something like how a white blood cell looks- a sphere with thick short threads sticking out of it all over, like string spikes. The source though was made out of these splints of love energy, and it radiated shards of this energy in streams of threads. It was like these thick threads became darts of love and acceptance, and they went out from the source in a constant stream of darts, one closely following after the other, in all directions just like how light and heat radiates from a star. These 'darts' were uniform in size and shape; about the size of one half of a #2 rounded pencil but twice as thick. The space around the Source was suffused with these love/acceptance darts.
<br>
"The spectacle of the Source suffused my awareness. There was no physical body or Earth, or anything else for that matter... just the Source. Then when the love and acceptance overcame me and I began to cry I was partially there with the Source, and partially here crying and wiping my face, and feeling this great relief and deep satisfaction in my chest and heart and body and mind... throughout my entire being I felt this peace.
<br>
"I let the tears cleanse me, and they cleansed me so deeply. I then withdrew my attention from the Source and sought out the Thiaooubans..."

Cool experience Spheres.
<br>
It is easy to understanding why much of that experience left you looking for answers.
<br>
Some scientists are now discussing the possibility of a Universal Consciousness Field. This new theory follows along the path of quantum physics and non-locality to explain how one person could potentially 'tap into' a universal psionic field of knowledge.
<br>
Though this may have no bearing on your experience it is an interesting idea.

Hi to all,  I was really waiting  for an obe........since summer  came I thought  that something was disturbing me  and could not consentrate enough  for projection.........I tried to fall asleep, and at once I felt the sensation......so I decided to follow it.....i started to leave my  body slowly...I was floating  with my astral body  in my room, this obe  compared with other ones was quite consious.......i was pretty wide awake....At first I positioned my self  in my room due to that I was  sleeping on the wrong side of the bed, after I did that   I was orientated...so I could navigate my self in my room quiet easily.....after that  I tried to move my self in my room.......the picture was quiet blury so when ever  this happened I tried to speak to myself  outloud "I want to see" or  "clear view"and   the  picture cleared out....i also would like to project  in light but my room was dark at that time.....but I still could see my room quite well..after that, something pulled me towards my brothers room there I started to wonder what was my purpose there for.. ...I think I saw   my brother that was sleeping and I tried to talk to him...I think we had some kind of interaction but he does not remember anything when I asked him this morning.....but I thouroully remember that we spoke.....at this point   I lost  consentration so I was  back to  my body  ....but once I   put my self togethor I automatically projected myself back to his room.......before I left his room....i  was playing around,  and  from the corner of my astral eye I could see an old women that   was all the time  at my side,  she would not confront me as I turned she would turn aswell,   she was  chubby, and had her hair in curls,she also was caring a suitcase...I decided to talk to this character....."who are you?" i asked her... she told me that she was one of my grand mothers......but she    did not really look like  the one she refered to. I am really happy that  I spoke to an entity  at that kind  of level because I had never done this before, usually  nobody is with me in my obe's could this have been a guide.....?..
<br>
I again   passed through the sliding doors  that seperates my room from my brothers... then I decided to pass  the  wall that was next to my bed.....when ever I try to do this I usually black out because   I can't get my self up to it, logic usually wins , but this time I had it all figured out so I passed the wall, the trick is to feel really free and really believe it .......behind the wall I saw  some people that were sitting on a  sofa  watching tv...I also think I saw  a dog of somekind....the people I think ignored me......that's all I can remember......
<br>
The good thing of this obe was that  I could really controll my self  I had my mind set...the second thing is that whenever I project I try to come in contact with a person I really love..i tried to project to her  but nothing really happened, I try to think of her..but I have't got anywhere yet  with this one...I think the difficulty is that  I have only the figure to project on and not the physical surroundings....i hope that these obe's will continue..and not come to a hault as before....maybe this happened because of  practising some kind of thibetian joga ......maybe that's why I could controll my thoughts......I'll keep in touch if any new experiances...come up...

Spheres: I'm never one to pour cold water on someone's fire, but it sounds to me like all you did was meet some member of your non-physical family who is normally resident within 5th dimensional reality.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, these people can often appear as a jumbled mass of sparkly lights. Plus, they radiate a kind of energy that makes you feel all humble and gooey inside. They don't mean to do it, it's just inherrent in their nature.
<br>
<br>
The feeling of nakedness is common too. They know everything about us because the respective minds are connected. So every little secret is laid bare. Following these kinds of encounters it is only natural to start thinking along the lines of having met with some kind of God.

Interesting post Frank. Your descriptions of 5th dimensional entities "as a jumbled mass of sparkly lights" leads to a theory. Which is -
<br>
at least some ghost 'orbs' which appear as balls, globs, or masses of lights are 5th dimension entities. As opposed to the more 'tradional flowing humanoid ghosts that are (only) 4 dimensional beings.
