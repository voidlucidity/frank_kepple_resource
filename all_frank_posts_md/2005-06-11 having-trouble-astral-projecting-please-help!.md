<section>
I've been trying all types of techniques the past few weeks (been at least a month now) and I know I must be doing something wrong. I Got to a point where my body felt as though it was vibrating, but only a bit. After a while I thought that I was ready having tried everything and now feel pulses through my body, so I tried the roll out technique... only when I landed on the floor, I fell, physical and all...
<br>
What can I do to make this work, how can I Project?? I've read so much on this and heard of so many techniques that I'm now confused by what I should try first (what truly works best)!! Please help me out!! I'm ready to try anything, to perfect any skill needed and am patient. Please help me out!!!
<br>
Thank you!
<br>

Hi:
<br>
<br>
If I may suggest, you need to perhaps take a big step back from all the "techniques" and just get used to looking within you first. Nothing more than that, just get used to looking within you and noticing what goes on. Do a search of my posts over the past few months on the "noticing" exercise. Take a look at that and see how you go.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Hello Wolf,
<br>
<br>
This is a much more common question than people realise. Please refer to my post in the Astral FAQ for the missing link:
