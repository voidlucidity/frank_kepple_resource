I got some time at the w/e to do a little practice on finding that point in the mind, to focus on. Having found what I can only presume was it, I was trying to persuade it to shift into the scene I'd been building. It was having none of it, so after 15 Min's I switched to the noticing exercise, was getting various swirly patterns appear, tho nothing to make me go "Whoa! Here we go!" So got to musing about I must be not looking in the right place, began probing around on the inside of my head to find the "I". It felt a bit like having a mental finger inside my skull, probing/feeling/tracing the contours until I came across something that had some resistance, or more like something that went 'Dink' when touched. Aha I thought this 'must' be it. Anyway not alot was happening on the imagery front, so in the end I thought I'd have a bit of fun with it, before stopping for the day.
<br>
I some how managed to grab hold of it mentally (A bit like putting some mentally constructed hands around it), and tried pulling and pushing to see what would happen.
<br>
Now...Here's the strange thing. I play one of those binural beats/waves through some headphone (mostly because of the external/distracting noises, where I live.), In the background of the sine wave I have that crashing ocean wave pink noise, gives that nice whooshing sound, so I start pulling and pushing to the sound of the waves, after a few moments the FoA starts to move! (although in physical terms it could have only been a few mm, or maybe 1/2 cm) After about five minutes or so of this pulling and pushing, really concentrating I got it up to quite a good speed, could see movement/ oscillations/ripple in a sort of deep silver blue colour...Then all of a sudden...LoL.. I start getting a quite strong wave of motion sickness, and had to stop. After the sensation had stopped I laughed like hell

Ha ha, I couldn't help but laugh but what you are doing sounds very much like "Frank's squishy ball technique". If you do a search then it may still throw up a few posts from the beginning days.
<br>
<br>
When I very first joined this forum I was experimenting trying to "slow down" my usual projection technique and trying to find that place in mind, and I would go through experiences very much like you are describing now.
<br>
<br>
I would say you are bang on target and will, before not too long, start making the same kinds of mental breakthroughs as I did.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

That sounds neat, until you get the motion sickness, anyway. I'm having trouble with the notion of finding something that doesn't really seem to have dimension - and when I try to put it into dimension, wind up just make the dimension of my mind my field of vision. I only stumble onto the point on accident, and only recognize it now because of the swirly colors and whatnot people talk about.

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Thanks ever so much for your words/encouragement there, I really appreciate it

I had a dig through the Astral pulse labyrinth(My goodness! what a huge number of posts there are here!
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
), and found one that seems to be one you referred to;

I'm about to print it out, so will be able to re-read it, when I leave work tonight. It's some really interesting reading, you point out several things that I immediately recognized, will get to work on. I also suspect this is this issue which I've been stumbling over in the last few weeks, boy what a mental conundrum this is!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
Still I enjoy a good challenge, even though it can be so frustrating at times!!

<br>
<br>
mactombs,
<br>
<br>
LoL, yeah that's what I thought too, until the nausea hit me
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
I've been sitting here thinking about how I found the thing...I remember I was thinking how nebulous the process/method in finding the "I" was and was moving my awareness around inside my brain case thinking "Well it must be in here somewhere" (A bit like a mental version of trying to find something you've lost amongst all the clutter in the house(Looking under the piles of books,etc)). So I'm using the awareness like a mental hand, eventually got to the area that everyone talks about, felt something there, felt like it was fixed, or maybe stuck there....And so I went "aha!"
<br>
But! Again, now that I'm thinking about the process what helped me find it essentially I was following the running commentary back to it's source, like finding the direction of a sound, with your ears... If that makes any sense?
<br>
As soon as I thought that I had this picture come up in mind of something like a megaphone, or one of those p.a tannoys on the long pole...I'm not sure what that even means yet, if anything?? Or if it's at all correct?? &lt;shrugs&gt;
<br>
<br>
Anyway...More food for thought I guess, I need an aspirin as all this speculation's given me a headache..Owww

&lt;edit&gt; Frank,
<br>
<br>
I've spent some hours this afternoon trying to find the expanded version of the 'squishy ball' topic this afternoon, but to no avail
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
But I did enjoy alot of the posting that you and some others have made, how techniques, etc have developed
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
If you happen to wander by again, I wonder, would you mind typing a bit more to expand it again? I know you're a very busy fellow, so if the essentials are contained in the link above, then no
<br>
worries
