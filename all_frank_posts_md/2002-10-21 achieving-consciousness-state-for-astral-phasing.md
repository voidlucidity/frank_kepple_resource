<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I am locking this topic in place as a core topic in our quest for fine tuning Astral phasing - which is assuming more importance by the day.
<br>
<br>
A proper level of consciousness or trance - mind awake/body asleep is a very important pre-cursor to Astral phasing. The "phasing sequence" and "Astral shift" through a portal, symbol, gateway etc. being another.
<br>
<br>
This is a pre-requisite state that many find difficult to achieve, and so it would be great if you people could go on record with your favourite most effective methods.
<br>
<br>
Thank you.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Did you want the whole sequence, from C-1 all the way to astral arrival or just the steps to achieve a proper trance state and from then on people kind of find their own specialized sequence through the portal or doorway?
<br>
<br>
Appreciatively,
<br>

Greetings Tracy!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your response and your question.
<br>
<br>
I am not too familiar with Monroe focus levels aside from what I have learned here, but in answer to your question, I amtrying to find out how people are achieving the pre-requisite trance state (F10?, F12?) as a pre-cursor to phasing into the Astral by any phasing method.
<br>
<br>
So it is achieving what I think would be an  F12 state.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

OK,
<br>
Here's what I do. First I write a definate "intent" on a piece of paper. This is where I want to go or what I wish to accomplish. I feel that this notifies my subconscious. I then get barefoot with both feet flat on the floor, feet close together. I place my hands palms down in my lap, usually one on each thigh..I may or may not listen to Hemi- or Holo-Sync. I relax and concentrate on the darkness behind my eyes and keeping my breathing at a slow steady pace. I feel as though I am waiting....expecting to soon see the colors that begin to swirl into the darkness behind my eyes.
<br>
At the same time I "feel" my third eye and crown chakra become active, or opening. This stage usually begins after about 20 minutes when the natural chemical reactions to the darkness begin ( much like going to sleep).
<br>
Once the colors beging to swirl, (violet,dark blue, white and gold) it is not long before a tunnel forms. I then begin to move my conciousness into and through this tunnel to arrive at my intended purpose or destination. Often, if I have requested a quide, this is when I will meet my guide.
<br>
Upon returning to my body I will feel the "vibrations" others speak of when they exit, but I do not experience them upon my exit. I do have a "body" there and can even change my clothing with a "thought" in an instant. I can communicate with others and have all of my senses, plus the ability to fly and the ability to focus my vision on a distant scene and bring it into a magnified focus (as if it were right in front of me).  I have the ability to speak with those who have passed over in death, see and touch them too.
<br>
<br>
I have experienced many interesting and creative adventures using the
<br>
above method.

Greetings Donna!
<br>
<br>
That is extremely useful input - thanks for that!
<br>
<br>
I take it you are sitting on a chair then to do this phasing?
<br>
<br>
Three questions if I may:
<br>
<br>
1) How does this "tunnel" manifest?
<br>
<br>
I suspect many people can achieve the state immediately before that with the swirling colours and so on, but do not receive the "invitation" to cross over into the Astral. I.e. it just remains as swirling colours or blackness.
<br>
<br>
2) Do you lose all sense of your physical body before the tunnel appears (i.e. in a full trance), and also during the projection itself can you sense the presence of your physical body, or does it sort of blend into the background?
<br>
<br>
3) Do you find the hemi/holo-sync makes any appreciable difference?
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

 At the first appearance of the colors it is as if they are spiked and jagged clouds which move into my visual field from the right and the left side towards the center. These swirl together as other colors come in from the side, this is quite beautiful and entertaining to watch. This movement speeds up until I get the "feeling" that I am moving forward into the center, As this progresses the black void is to the outside of my visual field and I am traveling very swiftly with these clouds to the end of this tunnel, often there will be swerves and slight curves in my progress (this travel is very fast, as I move "through" cloud formations in front of me.

 As I progess with this swift forward movement the clouds begin to thin, and often a "starscape" will appear which is my arrival point. The first time I ever did this I could not make myself go "forward", no matter what I tried,and had to return to my body. The next attempt I did succeed. I think the "written
 <br>
 intent" was what made this successful, as I had no goal in mind the first attempt. I learned by trial and error.

 When I use "this method" to travel, I am unaware of my physical body entirely by the time I reach the "starscape". Often though, if I proclaim a written intent to visit the "Great Pyramid" or "Stonehenge" or
 <br>
 any other point my exit will be at that destination.Until that time I gradually lose awareness of the physical, and am in "full trance".

 <br>
 As I began the hemi/holo-sync tapes before attempting to leave my body, some three years ago, it is hard for me to say. I often simply go into alternate states of conciousness without the help of the tapes. Though I learned that the connection that is formed between the right and left hemespheres of the brain with using the tapes is permanent. So once having used the tapes for the prescribed "time" they are no longer necessary. I was careful to use them as prescribed by Monroe Institute to gain this permanent bridge between the spheres of my brain. The instructions are in the materials they send with the tapes.

Could I just ask you - which Monroe CD(s) did you use, and what is the "prescribed time" for the brain sync to become permanent according to Monroe, and in your own experience?
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your other info - most useful.
<br>
<br>
I am beginning to think that the pre-requisite trance state can be achieved considerably sooner and consistently using the hemi-sync, than by getting there by meditation alone. Providing one does not become dependant on the hemi-sync CD's, as appears not to be the vase, then they do seem to be very worthwhile.

  <br>
  <b>
   I have searched the phamphlets for the Holo- and Hemi- Sync sessions that I have. In the "Mind Food" set from Monroe Institute it reads: " Hemi-Sync, a patented, scientifically-proven, auditory-guidance technology, is a process which uses carefully blended and sequenced sound frequencies to produce a frequency following response (FFR) in the two hemispheres of your brain. This FFR enables listeners to accomplish their goals by achieving and sustaining a focused, highly productive, coherent brain state. Hemi-Sync, based on more than fourty years of on-going reasearch at TMI, helps strenghten mental, physical, and emotional capabilities and empowers you to experience these capabilities while listening.
   <br>
   The Mind Food set contains "The Visit" and "Transcendence" CDs.
   <br>
   The More entailed written material from TMI that came with these CDs has more pertaining to the permanancy of the brain syncranization, but I can't find them just now.
   <br>
   <br>
   The Holo-Sync instructions state that The first CD in their set "The End Awakenig Prologue Program" must be used daily for 14 days. This CD is called "The Dive", which produces brain wave patterns from alpha to deep delta.. Then the second CD is added it is called "Immersion, which is a contuniuation of the deep delta state.  Among the many instructions with these CD,s in this set,they have a set period of time to use each CD as a minimum . They also include "Oasis", induces a theta brain wave pattern, and "Quietude" incuces an alpha brain wave pattern.  I will quote from their instructional booklet "
   <br>
   "How to tell if you are ready for the next level:"
   <br>
    1) You have completed at least four months of use of Awakening Prologue:
    <br>
    2) if you have been experiencing any upheaval as a result of using the program, it has smoothed out
    <br>
    3)you are able to consistently remain fully conscious during your listening sessions,
    <br>
    4)you have a feeling that the soundtaacks are not as powerful or do not have the same impact they once had.
    <br>
    This program offers custom tapes and CDs after this first level with further inhanced entrainment for  the brain.There is also a hotline and 24 hr. assistance with these CDs. I will now quote again from the leaflet " It is not possible to use this technology without the brain changing, any more than it is possible to exercise without your body changing."
    <br>
    Because this series causes a lot of psychological upheavel (for some people), or change in the brains' mechanics, they offer a serious support system.

Hi All
<br>
During my last projection I was moving at a high rate of speed toward what appeared to be an astral plane structure in the distance. I rolled onto my back and saw thin wispy clouds with a starfield in the backgound:very similar to what you describe. I got an overwhelming sense of vertigo and came awake in my body. Is the starfield an entrance? I guess I`m just asking for some astal directions.I didn`t see any roadsigns!

 Hi Focus15,
 <br>
 I had a more recent problem reaching the realms, it concerned a physical problem I was having at the time. My teacher met me in the ethers between here and the school to explain my problem. He/she said that I was having a little "set-back" and that when I was concentrating on the physical it lowered my vibration not allowing me to anchor my conciousness in the higher plane. She/he explained that where we focus our attention had a lot to do with our vibratory rate. Joy and laughter raise it, pain and physical illness lower it. This problem started with me "flipping" away from my connetion "there" during class and having to continually "reconnect". My physical condition worsened and so did my ability to project to the classroom. Once the problem passed, all was well again and my daily lessons there continued.

 Hi coral1,
 <br>
 I'm still laughing.....no I've never seen any roadsigns either. It does seem that this is a common experience though doesn't it? How nice it is to see that others are experiencing the same things. When I use the phasing method to travel this seems to be the point where I actually begin acheiving my "written intent". Does this appear to be the same for any of you others? Adrian mentioned this was a common point to get "stuck" at. If a lot of people are experiencing this what a wonderful common ground to explore.

<section>
Greetings BoomyBoomy!
<br>
<br>
Astral Dynamics is about OBE's, and which are a significantly different thing altogether to phasing. The traditional OBE is what was originally taught by Monroe, where one exteriorises awareness - in his case by "reaching" out for the vibrations, and when the vibrations start, one employs an exit method, e.g. "rope" as described in Astral Dynamics. OBE creates an etheric body, into which a copy of the mind (not the original) is projected, and the journey starts from there - often as an etheric projection into the so called "real-time zone", which is an etheric reflection of the physical plane.
<br>
<br>
Phasing is a projection of the consciousness to the inner Astral spheres. As the original mind is always involved, there is a much greater chance of remembering the experience as well as beong able to reproduce it reliably. Monroe moved on from OBE to phasing, and accordingly produced his famous tapes and "focus levels", the most famous of which is "The Park" at F27, which is the reception centre for most decent people who have recently passed on to the inner Astral spheres. People that are less than decent, or were highly religious, will likely find themselves in a lower Astral sphere which is inhabited by people with the same characteristics, or in a "belief system territory" where they can, well, carry on believing until they realise that, after all, their beliefs are folly, and then they can move on.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

 Hi boomyboomy,
 <br>
 I had worked with energy raising for years ( since 1989)  before trying the phasing method.I had used this type of energy raising to heal a full-body paralysis, which the doctors had stated would be permanent. O'Boy were they surprised!!  Roberts' Method, I had discovered about a year before I began phasing, so I had surpassed the required minimums, I guess. Balancing the poles (energy centers) of the body is vitally important to success, I think.

I can get to (from what I can tell) this trance state within a matter of minutes.  No joke, within about 5-10 minutes I am moving around at crazy speeds, or slow speeds, up and down, side to side, in and out, not really sure whats going on.  I see colors and swirling "light".  This is where i seem to get stuck though.  I always get music stuck in my head and can't shut it off, i think this is stopping me from going further.  I'll try some methods soon though to see if they help.
<br>
<br>
to quickly get to the trance state though, i just "push" myself forward mentally and it begins!!
<br>
hope this may help someone

<section>
I have very limited success with achieving the trance state through controlled relaxation/meditation.
<br>
It seems I can guarantee the buzzing/vibrations just by following a precise sleep pattern with no effort to actually attain the trance state, it just happens.
<br>
<br>
1) I get a full nights sleep (8-10 hours)
<br>
2) Get up and live life for 5-6 hours
<br>
3) Go for a nap
<br>
4) Trying to sleep when my body doesn't require sleep takes between one and two hours before I start dozing off. (This may be a good point to try techniques to stay concious) In my cases I simply fell asleep and seemed to have a vivid (not lucid I don't think) dream, wake up again, doze off again, have another bizarre vivid dream. This happens 3 or 4 times and suddenly I awake with either just the vibrations OR a combination of heavy vibrations and sleep paralysis. Before I knew about OBE's this was terrifying, now its exciting because I know I can simply float up or 'roll over' to achieve the OBE.
<br>
<br>
I accept this is a lazy technique and I can only do it this lazy way when time permits ie some weekends.
<br>
<br>
I am trying to achieve an OBE using relaxation/meditation which would mean I could get to the vibrational state in 30 mins instead of 2-3 hours.
<br>
<br>
I also noticed that if the lazy method failed when napping, if I went to bed again at night, because of the nap, I would still be awake and there was always a good chance the vibrations would kick in.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone else had an OBE using this lazy technique?
<br>
<br>
In some ways it feels like a cheat mode to an OBE but I'm not complaining if it works!!

Hi Alivie
<br>
I`ve had similar experiences.They usually occur during the afternoon when I`m napping. If I wake up and fall back asleep several times it increases the vividness and occasionally the lucidity of my dreams. I`ve gotten some vibrations as well. I`ve had some success projecting to the astra
<br>
l from lucid dreams but haven`t had much control. I think phasing is the way to go. But if I have the time, the "lazy technique" is a great way to spend the afternoon!

<section>
Donna, I find it interesting that you often experience the described "starscape" while phasing. I've experienced this many times myself. I haven't heard of phasing before I found this board a few months ago, but seemed to have used the phasing method quite by accident I guess many times in the past to induce what I considered to be lucid dreams at the time (I was attempting OOBE's) .
<br>
<br>
Anyways, while lying in bed I would often expect to see the ceiling above me (astral sight?), but would fequently see a large expanse of stars in a night sky instead, as you seem to have described. It was usually at this point if I remember correctly, that I would "rise up", and find myself fully lucid in some other environment (astral planes, or dream environment?). I dismissed these experiences as lucid dreams, as I had previosuly had a full blown OOBE in the past, and these experiences seemed to differ significantly (finding myself in an otherworldly environment other than the RTZ, no exit sensations, etc..). After hearing about phasing on this board, I'm not sure anymore about my experiences. Any thoughts? Anyone?
<br>
<br>
Best,

<section>
Adrian,
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  A proper level of consciousness or trance - mind awake/body asleep is a very important pre-cursor to Astral phasing. . .  This is a pre-requisite state that many find difficult to achieve, and so it would be great if you people could go on record with your favourite most effective methods.
<br>
<br>
My work is intended to help folks learn to explore our afterlife through their own direct experience, firstly just to prove to themselves that such a place actually exists, and secondly to explore our human existence beyond physical reality in greater depth.
<br>
<br>
What you describe as "Astral Phasing" is very similar to the technique I teach that I call Focused Attention.  If there is a difference it's that simple relaxation replaces the need for a trance or mind awake/body asleep state.  While a trance state might be useful, as you say, many people find it difficult to achieve.  In developing Focused Attention as a system of afterlife exploration I sought to keep it as simple as possible to make it useful to the largest number of people as possible.  What I found is that all that's necessary as a pre-requisite is that a person be able to sense some change in their level of relaxation during a slow, deep breathing exercise.  I wouldn't argue that deeper relaxation, or even a trance state, might not be useful I just don't find that it's necessary.
<br>
<br>
Once a person can feel that change in their level of relaxation an energy gathering exercise is used to sort of put one's consciousness on the charger.  This exercise is a variation on the Monroe Institute's ReBall exercise.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The "phasing sequence" and "Astral shift" through a portal, symbol, gateway etc. being another. &lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
There are a couple of things in the system I teach that I recognize as similar to what you're describing: placing intent; and the 3D Blackness.
<br>
<br>
Placing intent acts like an autopilot.  By properly placing intent to explore any area of consciousness one's focus of attention is automatically shifted there.  Once there all that's left to do to explore that area of consciousness is to take a look around so to speak.  Placing intent is a process of first clearly and precisely stating your desired outcome, like creating an affirmation.  Then either before, during or after stating the affirmation you just cause yourself to re-experience the feeling of placing intent.  I use a Silly Little Finger Bending exercise to help folks learn to recognize that feeling.
<br>
<br>
It's too long a discussion to explain here in detail but suffice it to say that if one focuses attention on any feeling that occurs the instant before a finger bends, one can experience the feeling of placing intent.  For me properly placing intent means remember to the point of re-experiencing that feeling as the affirmation is stated.  Many will recognize the placing intent feeling quality as the one they feel if they're stopped at a traffic light, first in line, knowing that very soon after the light turns green the first horn will honk behind them.  When the light turns green, the instant before any part of your body moves, a feeling like "GO" is experienced.  That one is very close to the feeling of placing intent.
<br>
<br>
The 3D Blackness is an area of consciousness that comes closest in my experience to a place of portals, gateways, or whatever term might used to describe them.  If one closes their eyes and relaxes, looking at the blackness before your eyes, you'd probably describe that blackness as 2D (two dimensional) or flat blackness.  There is another blackness, one that has depth, hence the term 3D (three dimensional) Blackness.  As one shifts their focus of attention to this 3D Blackness there is a noticeable shift in feeling quality.  In fact, once this shift has been experienced and that feeling quality identified a shift to 3D Blackness can be easily accomplished by just remembering that feeling quality to the point of re-experiencing it.  We can navigate to any area of consciousness using this technique, something I call the Hemi-Sync Model of Consciousness.  That model says that every area of consciousness has a specific feeling quality and if we remember that feeling quality to the point of re-experiencing it our focus of attention is automatically shifted there.
<br>
<br>
Once the shift has been made to the 3D Blackness, and either then or having previously placed an intent to explore some other area of consciousness, one just looks around within the 3D Blackness.  What you're looking for is any area within this Blackness that is a discontinuity from the surrounding blackness.  It could be that you'll see a small area that is darker or lighter than the surrounding area.  It might appear as a small, dark swirl or small area of activity within the 3D Blackness.  That is the 'portal' or opening to the pathway that leads to the area of consciousness you intend to explore.  Just by intending to begin moving toward such a 'portal' I usually find my focus of attention suddenly shifted there.
<br>
<br>
I don't mean to imply that one must be able to shift to the 3D Blackness in order to reach other areas of consciousness.  I consider this technique a little more advanced than is necessary for exploring our afterlife or areas of nonphysical reality beyond our afterlife.  But, many who practice the Focused Attention techniques I teach have stumbled into the 3D Blackness on their own and discovered its usefulness.
<br>

<section>
Good to have you here. I've read a lot mof the stuff on the afterlife forum.
<br>
<br>
For me the problem is not so much getting to a certain state of consciousness I've experiencede before but rather getting to one I havenät experienced.
<br>
It's a little like going to a new city. You know how to get to the city and that there are place you can visit but you don't know how to get to those places.
<br>
<br>
In the physical domain I can always find my way back to a place I've been before and in the spiritual domain it seems to be the same. Only there is no map to help me to get to the new places.
<br>
<br>
After a lot of stumbling I've found my way to the 3D blackness place but the road from there is still shrouded. The previous intent doesn't work which is consistent with finding my way back to a place I've been before. Once I can state the exact place I want to go I can get there but before that it's the matter of stubmling in the dark and recording where I get.

Hi there Jouni, hows things ?
<br>
<br>
I'm a little behind you in terms of "progress"...Last week I finally saw the 3d blackness for the first time, although only for a few seconds.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore last night whilst doing hemi sync wave 1, I got to a point where I could shift my point of awareness around the room !! Needless to say, I'm quite excited by all of this, because it seems that the hours of practice are gradually giving results.
<br>
<br>
Anyway ! the point I wanted to make was simply that Bruce stated above :
<br>
<br>
"I don't mean to imply that one must be able to shift to the 3D Blackness in order to reach other areas of consciousness. "
<br>
<br>
So clearly, the "cause and effect" progress that we are both making / expecting to make- ... is not a pre-requisite.
<br>
<br>
I think it is important that we realise that there are many ways to get "there"... I have been limiting myself in some ways to a "route" that I should follow, dictated by the experiences of others.
<br>
cheers !
<br>
Mark

On an intellectual level I believe that we are already there, in the astral I mean. But since I can't  convince my subconscious oif this I need to stumble around until I get where I want to go and find out it's where I left.
<br>
The route that we, I at least,  take is only a tool to give the subconscious a sense of achievement and thus a permission to do our bidding, ie. open the door to the desired state of conscousness. It doesn't have to follow cause and effect, actually it doesn't imho. Sometimes I get the feeling that themore I experiment and work at the problem the further form the goal I get, as if I started working my way from the goal to my normal state.
<br>
<br>
Oh, that flitting your awareness around the room sounded neat. I'll see if I can do the same

The starscape effect generally occurs as part of the Phasing process. It is also common to see whirling shapes or clouds of colour, and such like. Basically, you switch from seeing only the 2-dimensional blackness at the back of your eyelids... to having a feeling of moving into a 3 dimensional blackness, which is often punctuated by lots of little yellow lights in the distance (well, with me they are bright yellow).
<br>
<br>
If you progress further you typically feel a kind of mental shift wherupon you find yourself within the Astral someplace. Which is what happened to you. But if you slow that shift down, you find it is possible to travel through the blackness and go right up to the lights, for example. Or you can have a root around and see if you can come across what are commonly called Astral Plane Entrance Structures of the kind R.Bruce printed on the back of AD.

Thanks for the response Frank. I appreciate the feedback. Your description of this "3D blackness" mirrored my own experience last night. In an attempt at an OBE last night I envisioned a friend that I wanted to visit very strongly in my mind. Knowing that she would likeley be asleep at the time, I pictured her lying in bed. The "blackness" indeed took on a 3D effect, almost as if I were peering into a window of a darkened room of sorts. Then a strange thing happened which I wasn't epecting at all. All of a sudden what looked like a 3d "picture" of sorts came quickly into my field of view (it appeared to move towards me from the distance, quickly growing larger as it approached). In this "picture" I clearly saw the figure of a female lying in bed in what appeared to be my friends bedroom. Then a moment later the image faded, and the experience was over.
<br>
<br>
I never shifted, or phased into the location, but felt as if I could have. Perhaps this was merely clairvoyance, or a remote viewing episode. I've never experienced either before. I'm gonna try again tonight

I think I phased this morning.  I'm not sure.  I'll try to describe it, and then you experienced people tell me if I'm posting in the right place:
<br>
<br>
It started out like dreams moving through dreams, you know, the typical unaware dream thing.  Then, after an emotional burst and commitment to "leave" a dreamscape I found myself aware in a bedroom on the second floor of a house.  Quiet, completely tidy, almost monastic, with a window looking out over a pretty landscape.  (Definitely "lucid dream" material, I hear you thinking . . . ok now it gets weird)
<br>
<br>
So, I'm standing there, thinking, okay, I'm in this room, and then all of a sudden the view in front of my eyes  morphs into me in bed, and it is morning.  Kind of like a special effect in a movie.
<br>
<br>
It was totally different than "waking up" - -   In fact, if I were to get technical, I haven't "woken up" yet!  I'm still in my dream!
<br>
<br>
So here I am typing on Astral Pulse and munching on my 6th chocolate of the day.  Christmas party went off without a hitch.  It all SEEMS normal - - hey, you all out there?
<br>
<br>
One thing I noticed during the shift was something akin to electrical "static," sort of like what you hear after you turn off the TV and run your hand over the screen.  In fact, more than anything else I've experienced, it felt the way I used to feel coming back from my OBE's - - - except with my OBEs I heard the static but felt as though I were emerging from under water (though I could always breathe).
<br>
<br>
OK, is this phasing?  I'm awfully curious.

<br>
Tisha: It sounds from what you say you came awake within a lucid dream and found yourself within the Astral someplace. Also, the experience at the end I think is you having a more controlled return.
<br>
<br>
Normally, in the beginning, the return phase tends to be executed rather hurredly, more as a means of "escape" than anything.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
But as the return sequence gets more controlled it does get to seem a lot like you describe. In that you first tend to see an image of you within the Physical, and it does feel a lot like you've come awake. But the confusing thing is, at the same time you know you are still within something of an Astral experience... and then you come awake in the Physical proper.

  Well, these are all good suggestions, but I still have a simple, minor problem.  Ya see, no matter how hard I try, I always seem to have a song in my head.  The only time I think I DONT have a song playing up there is when i first wake up.  And at that point im just not ready to conentrate on ANYTHING!  Well...any tips?

Funnily enough, this morning I came awake with a song in my head.
<br>
<br>
I had been pottering about in my workshop the previous day repairing my nephew's car, and I'd had the radio on. There was a particular song that kept playing and it got to be a bit annoying. I actually switched the radio off because of it. Anyhow, this morning it was still in my head.
<br>
<br>
As a few people here have posted about having the same problem I thought, hmm, I wonder if it would be possible to use this situation advantageously in some way.
<br>
<br>
So I focused on the tune and, what was happening, this chorus-line kept repeating. The main instrument was a piano together with a voice. I don't even know what the tune is called (I'll try and find out) but it has this catchy piano bit that keeps repeating. Anyhow, rather than try and shut it out, I began to concentrate more and more on this repeating piano. As I did so, the voice part faded into the background to the point where only the piano notes remained.
<br>
<br>
Next I started slowing down the sequence of notes, ever more gradually to the point where I was taking just one note at a time. As I was doing this, I also gradually increased the length of each note so each one would last a about a second or two (note lengths vary naturally, so increased them all in proportion to what they were originally). I concentrated on feeling each note and tried to make them as real, i.e. as lifelike, as possible in my mind.
<br>
<br>
Well, I think I hit on something here, because after only about 10 minutes of this I found myself stepping into 3D blackness!
<br>

<br>
Yes indeed! I would suggest that it goes further to one of the main principles that we have been discussing in this forum. Specifically, in order to phase into the Astral, it is necessary to phase out of the physical, or more specifically away from the five physical senses with which we experience our physical environment.
<br>
<br>
Hitherto, we have discussed focusing internally on created imagery, but I see no reason why we should not focus on sounds, e.g. music, or even smells or even touch. The point is, one is shifting ones focus from our mundane physical senses to the Astral senses, and once a full set of Astral senses is achieved, the gateway to the Astral presents itself.
<br>
<br>
Thanks as ever.

<br>
<br>
Yes, exactly so. Incense is widely used by people in environments, and at times, when altered states of consciousness are required, e.g. meditation and trance.
<br>
<br>
When used in the same consistent circumstances, the incense programs the subconscious to associate a particular fragrance with a particular state. So by simply lighting and inhaling that particular incense, the subconscious automatically induces the right conditions for that desired state. Other such factors can be donning particular clothes, performing a particular ritual, playing a particular sound etc. - all designed to move consciousness away from the mundane existence to the inner/higher state.
<br>
<br>
As I mentioned before, I am sure that phasing has always been a major method of accessing the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The famous cave drawings of Europe and elsewhere are another example. The tribe "Shaman" would enter the Astral state of consciousness by means of the drumming, chanting etc. of the other tribe members. The drawings are symbolic imagery depictions of what the Shaman encountered in the Astral, and represents the message he was bringing to the tribe back from his Astral journies and encounters. Cave drawings were effectively the stone age version of these forums
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;  Drawing was the only practical method of depicting such encounters due to the difficulty in describing them with complex language.
<br>
<br>
I think the ancients were much more tuned into the Astral than people today are generally, because they had far less mundane physical stimuli and factors to concern themselves with.  That is another reason why mankind's current course is taking it further and further away from reality and truth.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your exceptional contribution in 2002, and that of everyone else, and again, I wish everyone a very Happy and Peaceful 2003, and may you all be successful in making progress on the path.

wow, I have this huge prbolem with music being left in my head.  I am a very musicla person, played instruments and can run a song note to note (every instrument at the same time with voice as well) on tune in my head from start to finish.  It is so horrible as it makes it hard to work on Obe's and the like.  Not to mention it makes it hard to sleep!  Thanks for the input on the ideas for that though, I should try that......
<br>
<br>
One more thing, what really is the 3D blackness?  I can get ot a point where the blackness in front opf my eyes seems to feel like it has depth, and then my consciessness feels hge, and small, and I move around alot?  is that space of 3D the 3D blackness that is spoken of?  thanks in advance!!!!!

Fundamentally there is no difference except for the trademark. Both products, and indeed several others, make use of bineural beats for brainwave entrainment.  Notwithstanding the claims are their somewhat hard sell site, these benefits are attainable, but the speed of such attainment will, in my opinion, vary from individual to individual based upon natural brainwave frequencies.
<br>
<br>
If you have headphones for your PC and an extension cable of sufficient length, I would strongly recommend BWGEN, which costs $40 to register, but will allow for an almost unlimited number of possibilities at no additional cost. The website is:

We have some presets in the file library here which are similar to the hemi-sync series - I cannot publicly say "identical" to [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
<br>
The optimum frequency is around 4Hz according to my own research, and I suspect that holosync and similar simply start out at the higher frequencies and take you progressively lower. Whether this approach has any benefits over using just one frequency, i.e. 4Hz remains to be seen.

I have a question dealing with music and the astral senses (the shift from external to internal). Could it possibly work somehow to shift into your internal astral senses by exterannly listening to music? For example, if you knew the music very well, and could replay it in your head. Could you be listening to it, and somehow tricking your mind into thinking you were hearing it inside your head and phasing that way? I ask because I always listen to music at night when I usually do any astral/energy work, and it usually does not act as an external distraction. As I type this it sounds like it could get a bit complicated on the process my mind would be going through, but I also think it's worth a try.

Hi,

I usually use the ROPE method for conventional OBE type exit attemps.  I temporarily stopped using it recently because of a breathing problem that was throwing a spanner in the works.  During the attempts, I recall seeing my field of vision alternating from tiny to huge and circular etc.  I was wondering if this had anything to do with the 3d blackness?

<section>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I think I hit on something here, because after only about 10 minutes of this I found myself stepping into 3D blackness! &lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
That's one of the best descriptions I've read about doing something I call prime the pump exercises.  As part of the preparatory process for afterlife exploration I encourage folks to actively imagine images, sounds, smells, tastes and touches.  It's a way of shifting one's focus of attention to the nonphysical senses.
<br>
<br>
Having a song running through your head is a perfect way to practice using one's nonphysical sense of hearing or stimulate that sense for use during exploration.  Remembering a parent, a pet, or something else that evolks a mind's eye image is the same sort of thing for our nonphysical sense of sight.
<br>
<br>
I call these exercises Priming the Pump of imagination  because I'm old enough to remember carrying a bucket out to the pump to get water for my mom.  If I just started pumping the handle up and down no water came out.  I had to pour a little bit of water into the top of the old pump to prime it.  Keep pumping the handle after that and eventually water filled the bucket.
<br>
<br>
I know there's some confusion about what I mean by using imagination as the means of perception and yours is a good example of what I mean.  Imagining the sound of a song to the point of hearing it is that little bit of water one uses to prime the pump of imagination.  At some point the experience takes on a life of its own so to speak.
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't be at all surprised to know that if you used the 3D Blackness to "go" somewhere that your sense of hearing seemed to be working well.
<br>
<br>
Bruce

Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
I had my first experience of Phasing the other day, and it all happened pretty much as described here. The imagination factor is an interesting one - Although I had no real intent, while I was in the 3D blackness I had a vague thought of playing in the park as a child, and a moment later I found myself riding on a swing, leaning back and looking up at the sky, and feeling the up and down movement.
<br>
<br>
Altogether, I've found traditional OBEs a very frustrating and confusing experience (trouble with movement, vision, memory etc), so I'm really looking forward to exploring Phasing.
<br>
<br>
Which (one) book of Monroe's would you guys recommend for beginning techniques? I am a poor student teacher and can't afford fancy paraphernalia...

Ta,

<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a number of PM's asking similar questions about my comments regarding the mental-rundown given on the monster-thread as being a kind of primer which kick-starts the natural Phasing process.
<br>
<br>
The questions relate to how you integrate the two and kick-start the process; how can you tell when the process has been kick-started, and what to do then, etc. So I thought I'd post a reply here as it pertains to the thread title.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 What is the purpose of creating a mental rundown?
</b>
<br>
<br>
The rundown acts as a kind of mental primer which gets you in the mood and increases your anticipation and expectation levels (very important). The rundown is not what causes you to Phase to the Astral. Phasing is a natural process which comes about under certain mental conditions which I expand on later in this essay. It also gives a person practice in focusing their attention away from the physical body into the expanse of their mind. In other words, what you are basically doing is
<i>
 imagining
</i>
you are Phasing to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 What shall I try, and for how long, and how often?
</b>
<br>
<br>
The mental-rundown exercise should be performed preferably at least once each day at around the same time. It does not really matter what kind of mental rundown you use. Simply do whatever feels right for you. Someone posted fairly recently they tried to work out their own but gave up and used the example I gave with a few changes here and there. Others have created their own from scratch. Like I say, it truly does not matter.
<br>
<br>
You don't actually need the Wave-1 CD either. You can formulate a mental rundown to some relaxing music, or create something using Brainwave Generator, or use whatever suits you. All I would advise is for you to create something of around 30 to 45 minutes duration which you are basically happy with
<i>
 then stick with it
</i>
. In other words, don't make it too short, or too long, and no chopping and changing.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Okay, I've formulated a mental rundown so what next?
</b>
<br>
<br>
Once you have learnt your mental rundown you are ready to use it as a mental primer. First you go through it. Then simply remove the earphones (if you are using a CD or tape) and try Phasing for real.
<br>
<br>
In cases where you perhaps haven't got all that much time to spare, what I would suggest is you create a short version of your rundown. Say, around half the duration. Then, every other time, listen to the short version after which you try for real. Once you get more competent then perhaps switch to the short version each morning. Or maybe try a regime of rundown one day and try it for real with no rundown the next. Again, it truly is a case of whatever suits each individual.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 What do you mean by "Phasing for real?"
</b>
<br>
<br>
When you come to Phase for-real, you switch from perceiving metal imagery you are imagining as part of your rundown, i.e. where you are imagining you are Phasing to the Astral, to perceiving images that are being created as part of the normal Phasing process. In other words, you are not imagining anything, you are doing it!
<br>
<br>
<b>
 After going through my rundown I try it for real and nothing happens, why?
</b>
<br>
<br>
Chances are, your physical-body is distracting you by capturing your attention.
<br>
<br>
One of the benefits of formulating a mental-rundown to some kind of audio recording, is it takes your mind off both the physical body and the Physical environment. Plus, you know exactly what imagery to perceive as it is you who is imagining it. Without these two mental props it can feel like you are right back at square one.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 Main things you should avoid when trying for-real
</b>
<br>
<br>
<u>
 Thinking about day-to-day Physical-realm matters
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
Any kind of thinking about anything to do with the Physical-realm tends to put a *big* spoke in the works. In other words, you can't really hope to kick-start the Phasing process if one part of you is thinking of your dental appointment next day; or whether you'll get that pay-rise you requested; or your birthday next week, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
To deal with this what you should do, right at the start of your practice, is imagine a large box and place all your Physical-realm concerns in that box. Then lock it securely and walk away. When you finish your mental-rundown, unlock the box and take them out again. This method is suggested by Monroe on the Wave-1 CD. It may sound a bit weird but it works!
<br>
<br>
<u>
 Any kind of internally verbalised thought (even if it is to do with Phasing!)
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
What I mean here, is you need to switch your inner-thinking so it is working
<i>
 exclusively
</i>
in a visual way. Speed-reading aside, when we read to ourselves we have this inner voice which reads the words. This voice is probably what you are listening to within your own mind, right now as you read this.
<br>
<br>
Also, when we think to ourselves in an everyday sense we tend to use this same inner voice. Like, you may think, "Hmm, I've got 30 minutes before I meet my next client, so I'll go and fill the car with petrol and pick-up something to eat on the way back." Thinking that way uses that same inner-voice...
<u>
 which must be silent
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
Then you quietly and passively observe what happens next.
<br>
<br>
When I say "quietly" I mean observe without having that inner-voice comment on anything you may perceive.
<br>
<br>
When I say "passively" I mean avoid reacting in any way to anything you may perceive.
<br>
<br>
Both the above I realise are a tad tricky to do. The good news is it all comes good with practice. At first, what will probably happen is you might perceive some kind of vague, fleeting image. At which point your inner-voice will chirp-up saying, "What was that?" or it might make some other comment. Perhaps it may comment in recognition that you are making progress.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, as it does so, it tends to send you a step back each time. Unfortunately, you can get caught in a self-defeating loop: where you take one step forward, your inner voice recognises you just took a step forward and comments to that effect, and the act of it doing so takes you one step back to where you were before.
<br>
<br>
Or you might perceive something and react to it. You might get startled, or fearful, or such like. What used to happen to me all the time (which was
<u>
 most
</u>
frustrating) is I'd perceive some image in mind and, the moment I did so, my physical eyes would try and snatch a glance at whatever it was. This, of course, zapped me right back to C1 each time.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so you are in a state where you are quietly and passively observing. Don't worry if nothing comes about. Simply curtail the session after your normal time and try again next session. Hopefully, what will soon happen is you will begin to perceive what may seem like fairly weird, totally abstract mental imagery.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Say you perceive some fleeting kind of something or other. Chances are you'll wonder if what you think you may have perceived is what you should be starting to perceive. Then you'll realise your inner voice has just made a comment. But the realisation of that was yet another comment. By which time you'll probably be right back where you started.
</i>
<br>
<br>
The key is to simply roll along with this mental imagery, without your inner voice commenting on it, or having your physical body reacting to it. This is the beginning of Phasing. You don't need any particular "technique" in order to project. You just need to set it going. Once the process gets underway everything happens more or less automatically.
<br>
<br>
If you can just quietly and passively observe the process you will end up within the Astral as awake and alert as you normally are while within the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

What I have started to do is save copies of my posts on my hard-drive under various folder headings. This gives me the benefit of being able to cut and paste when answering common questions. Plus, I'm also formulating a Phasing FAQ list and have the idea also of once I've collated enough posts I can convert these into various articles; which I'm hoping Adrian will allow me to publish on the resources section.

That way newcomers will have the lion's share of the Phasing information in 2 or 3 chunks rather than having to search through a mountain of separate posts. As for publishing a book, I think the e-book route might be a future possibility. Something that explains the whole Phasing notion right from square one would be nice. But I'll have to collate quite a bit more information before I have enough to fill a book.

Best news I've heard in a long time Frank!
<br>
<br>
Especialy for the phasing process. This is what you have called the "tricky" part. Keeping the mind "awake", but not too much, losing the body consciousness...phasing into the astral. When I read your posts on this subject, I know what your are saying, I understand the words, but the difficulty arises in the comprehension of how to do it, of applying it to the mind, to your awareness, in the "how-to".
<br>
<br>
Although you have writen many time on this, using different wording to try to explain it the best you can, there's a subtleness hard to grasp, unless you have actually done it I guess. Some of the other OBiers writing about their experiences, you could relate to and understand what they where talking about, but I have to imagine and understand the subtleness of the process, try to get a mental comprehension on how to get there.
<br>
<br>
Please take your time Frank, and go at length in your explanation of this most important aspect of OBE.
<br>
<br>
I know you've said you had to work hard and a long time to learn to OBE, I'm beginning to wonder if I will ever have one, but your contribution is an incentive, to keep at it.
<br>
<br>
Very generous of you, thanks!

  What I have started to do is save copies of my posts on my hard-drive under various folder headings. This gives me the benefit of being able to cut and paste when answering common questions. Plus, I'm also formulating a Phasing FAQ list and have the idea also of once I've collated enough posts I can convert these into various articles; which I'm hoping Adrian will allow me to publish on the resources section.

This sounds really excellent!  Thank you very much indeed for taking the time to do this that others may benefit.

You can be sure that you can have as much resources here as you require to publish your work, and we can have a sticky topic in this forum linking to it as well.
<br>

A book on Astral phasing really would be something, and I am certain it would be a huge success. I hope this is something that comes to fruition.

Adrian: Thank you for your encouraging comments and I am indeed grateful for your offer.
<br>
<br>
Basically, I'm looking for ways to get the Phasing information across more efficiently. What started out as an interesting conversation, over a year later, has grown into its own forum complete with oodles of posts.
<br>
<br>
Those who have been around for a while are pretty much in-touch with the basics. But for beginners, it must be quite a task searching through all the posts trying to piece this and that together.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I could not agree more.
<br>
<br>
The posts in this forum, and in particular your own contain a wealth of advanced knowledge and information on phasing/Astral projection, that, in my opinion, are far in advance of any book that I am aware of. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that phasing is the way forward for Astral exploration. Indeed, I also believe that the ancients used to use phasing as well, until the entire concept of Astral projection went off course with the "OBE" phenomena.
<br>
<br>
Phasing has got us back on course, and at the same time, thanks in no small part to your own efforts, provided for a modern and achievable method of Astral exploration within the reach of everyone.
<br>
<br>
For quite some time now I have been also considering the creation of our own Astral meeting place (and I mean Astral - not some place in the etheric reflection of the physical world), and which can be accessed by anyone of any ability. This would not only provide for a very real meeting place for experienced Astral projectors to meet and share experiences and compare notes afterwards, but would also be a training ground where people can progress from a simple "mental" presence to full Astral presence over time. More on this later.
<br>
<br>
Please let me know whne you are ready and what you require, and we can progress things straightaway.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Frank, Adrian, or anyone else who can give an advice;
<br>
Tried to phase about half an hour ago, but without the Wave I CD (verbal guidance and specific timings are not things I like too much) and without a mental primer (it's
<i>
 much
</i>
easier for me to suppress my inner voice while concentrating on a single thing instead of running scenes - should allow phasing just as well I believe). After a short while I started to feel something like a buzzing in my forehead with a varying intensity and then my whole body started to feel as if it's spinning around quickly. It all lasted for about 10 minutes I assume. Are those the famous vibrations I hear about? And if so, what am I supposed to do next in order to project? Or maybe I can phase from this stage too (preferable)?
<br>
<br>
P.S
<br>
Adrian, I think that if it's feasible, the Astral meeting place is a wonderful, wonderful idea [

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I have been contemplating the concept of the "Astral locale" members meeting place for quite some time, and have researched it, and I am quite sure it could work very well.
<br>
<br>
I don't want to go into too many details at this juncture, but it would work something like this.
<br>
<br>
I would find (perhaps with the help of people here) a first rate graphic artist to create an Astral locale as a graphic which would be posted here in the forums under the project topic. We could possibly all have a say in the construction and features. The Astral locale would anyway be very carefully thought out, and have such features as meeting places, and also "doorways" to other realms, e.g. the realms of the Elements as well as a portal for other parts of the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The creation of the locale itself will give it an initial Astral presence - everything created in the imagination is created in the Astral initially - but usually only transiently. The graphic would be posted here as the reference point for phasing - similar to the imagery of the Monroe tapes, except we would all us the same imagery - the Astral locale.
<b>
 Everyone
</b>
can participate in this! Those that can phase already will be able to phase to the locale in the Astral and meet with others. Those that cannot yet phase will start with a sort of meditation, which will consist of a degree of relaxation, while keeping the image in mind and imagining travelling and being there. After mentally arriving you would mentally walk around the locale and observe the features. Soon enough, a simple mental presence will be achieved which might or might not be perceivable by the other participants. Over time however, with repeated practice, the mental presence will become stronger and stronger, and soon become a full Astral phased presence perceivable by all. As more and more people participate, the Astral locale will become more and more "solid" and permanent, and more and more energetic. This is how locales are created by the Astral residents themselves - repeated use of a created locale gives it permanency.
<br>
<br>
This will not only provide the possibility for a shared Astral experience, but at the same time provide those that cannot yet phase the focal point and motivation to succeed, and supported by everyone else. Experiences and notes can be compared here. The doorways and portals can then be used for onward exploration. I think this would provide a multitude of purposes, including but not limited to assisting people in the phasing process, providing a meeting place, and performing group activities such as retrievals and exploration. I would hope that it would be possible to attract the presence of permanent Astral residents - helpers, guides and many others. It could also be potentially used as a place for meeting deceased relatives, friends and loved ones, by incorporating the methods of Bruce Moen and his friends.
<br>
<br>
I would be interested to get some feedback on this idea.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hi Adrian
<br>
<br>
I think that`s a great idea! I could use a location in the Astral to help with navigation which for me is still a hit and miss affair.I look forward to hearing more.

<br>
What you describe, i.e. the buzzing in the head and feelings of spinning around, these sensations are ever so typical of the beginning stages of Astral projection in a more traditional sense. What you probably experienced was a very short, blind projection into the real-time zone: where you spun around a few times and that was it.
<br>
<br>
It will take time before you find your feet, so to speak, and overcome the "fish out of water" effect by gradually refining the process and becoming more familiar with the various sensations. Problem is, at this stage, a
<u>
 lot
</u>
depends on the person. For example, you already discovered a still scene works better for you than a moving one (it just so happens I am the exact opposite). What you need to do then is keep exploring these sensations and carry-on down a path of basic trial and error.
<br>
<br>
After a while, you will learn how to anticipate the onset of the vibrations and how to control them. That way, rather than having them buzzing about all over the place with varying intensity, you will be able to control their intensity. Once you become more practiced, you will find the vibrations take on a much higher pitch to the extent where you hardly notice them. The comparison is a lot like taking-off in a Microlight -versus- a Learjet 45.
<br>
<br>
Something which just popped into mind, I used to practice, is what I'd call "bathing" in the vibrations. What I mean is you hold them at a particular pitch and intensity so you end up floating just above your physical body just enjoying the buzzing feeling. After a few minutes, gradually shut them down so to bring you back to Physical (C1). Then do the same again. Also, when you get to the stage where the vibrations are more or less under your control, i.e. where you are hovering in mid-air just buzzing away merrily, try taking some deep breaths and see if that has any effect.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: When I say "breaths" I don't mean taking actual Physical breaths though it will feel like the same action. I found the act of breathing in and out, both at the preliminary vibrational stage and while within the Astral (not that there is any actual need to breathe within the Astral), has some very interesting effects.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Greetings Adrian,

What an excellent idea! Im sure there is not one person here who would not benefit from the creation of such a locale. The possibilities it will create are staggering.I will certainly pour as much thought energy into this as I possibly can.

frank,  i can't say enough. i've been spinning my wheels for 25 years. sometimes with success, more often laziness. you've been an inspiration.

My favorite technique is Hypnosis. I go past Alpha and into Theta Brain Wave which is (hypnosis-Somnambulism-and Lucid Dreaming) all and the same. I dont go to the next 3 levels beyond Somnambulism which is the Esdaile State, Canatonic State,and the last is Ultra Depth or (Sichort State).
<br>
<br>
I can go into it with my key work "DEEPLY RELAX" which is a post hypnotic word I use for meyself. As I say it in my mind I go back to that same level of relaxation within seconds.
<br>
<br>
Here is the Hypnosis Script that I use. When you see each of these (...) pause for 4 seconds.  Speak softly and in a monotome voice. Have some else read it to you or tape it in your own voice on a tape recorder.  Lay back and don't cross your legs and have your arms on your side of your body.
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION
<br>
(supine)
<br>
<br>
Speak slowly and pause between instructions.  Have your subject(s) lay in a comfortable
<br>
Positioin.  It is recommended to have the knees raised up to avoid unnecessary strain of the back muscles.  A small pillow under the neck to help give support to the neck is also beneficial.  Be sure that any tight fitting clothing is loosened and jewelry removed during the relaxation.  Lighting should be lowered and to deaden the sound of outside noises, soft background music complementing your session could be played.  Please do not say, "SLEEP" during the progressive.  When bringing the subject(s) up, do not us the word "AWAKE".  (This is a camouflage method of hypnosis).  Remember, to avoid the word hypnosis at all times.  The wording is as follows. Start reading aloud below this line.
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
Close your eyes and keep them closed until I ask you to open them.  Now I want you to take a deep breath, filling your lungs up completely and then let that breath out slowly...Now take a second deep breath and let that out slowly also...Now I want you to take another very deep and comfortable breath filling your lungs up completely and this time hold that breath...(long pause)...Now let that breath out very slowly and already you can feel your body begin to relax...
<br>
<br>
Now let that wonderful, comfortable feeling of relaxation flow ALL the way DOWN to your feet, just feel your feet becoming very comfortable and very relaxed...If you don't feel it in your feet right away don't worry about it, for it will gradually catch up to you...
<br>
<br>
Now let that wonderful, comfortable feeling of relaxation flow from your feet up into your ankles...from your ankles up all the large and small muscles of your legs to your knees...from your knees up all the large and small muscles of your thighs... into your hips...from your hips into your abdomen and with each and every breath that you exhale I want you to allow your body to go deeper into this wonderful relaxed state...
<br>
<br>
Now let that wonderful feeling of relaxation flow right up into your back...just let all of those large and small muscles of your neck relax...as it flows right up into your shoulders...over your shoulders...and down deep into your chest...such a wonderful feeling, just going DEEPER and DEEPER...as that relaxation flows down all the large and small muscles of your arms to your elbows...from your elbows down to your wrists...into your hands...all the way out to your fingers and with each and every breath that you exhale your body just keeps right on relaxing deeper and deeper...
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let this wonderful feeling of relaxation flow up into your neck...feel all these large and small muscles of your neck relaxing...flowing right up into your head ...over your head...and DOWN into your brow...all the muscles around your eyes, relax...Now if you have your teeth clenched, just unclench your teeth and your body will relax much more...just let your jaw sag and all the body muscles will go loose and limp as a RAG DOLL as you go deeper into this wonderful relaxed state...
<br>
<br>
As I count from one down to three I want you to allow your body to go deeper into this beautiful relaxed state ... so One ... deeper and deeper ... Two ... more and more relaxed ...Three ... very deep, very comfortable and very relaxed ... with just pleasant, contented thoughts going through your mind and marvelous feeling going through your body, and your whole body is giving in, letting go...you're warm and comfortable...relaxing deeper as all the sounds around you send you deeper ... any sound that you hear sends you even deeper ... the sound of my voice sends you deeper ...
<br>
<br>
So, as I keep on talking you just keep on relaxing deeper and deeper into this wonderful relaxed state ... with each breath that you exhale, you go deeper ... the beat of your heart sends you deeper...any and all sensations that you experience send you deeper ... with each thought that you think you go deeper and deeper ... DOWN into a wonderful deep relaxed state ... just feel your muscles loose and limp as a RAG DOLL ...
<br>
<br>
Now again I will count, but this time I will count from one down to five and as I count form one down to five you will allow your body to double its relaxation...So one...your relaxation is slowly starting to double...two...your relaxation is doubling more and more ... three ... you're very comfortable and relaxed ... four your relaxation has almost doubled...five your relaxation now has doubled completely thoughout your whole body ... from the top of your head to the tip of your toes all the muscles in your body have relaxed and doubled their relaxation ... you feel so relaxed and comfortable that all of your muscles are going loose and limp as a RAG DOLL ...
<br>
<br>
Now again I will count from one down to five ... and as I count ... from one down to five ... this time the body will triple its relaxation ... one ...relaxation is starting to triple ... two ... relaxation is tripling more and more ... three ... you are very comfortable ... very relaxed ... four ... relaxation now has almost triple in the body ... five ... relaxation now has tripled in the body ... from the top of your head to the tips of your toes ... all the muscles have relaxed ... doubled their relaxation ... and tripled their relaxation ...
<br>
<br>
All the muscles are loose and limp as a RAG DOLL ... all the nerves are calm ... relaxed ... all the body tissues are rejuvenating in this wonderful relaxed state ... just sinking DOWN ... just letting go ... deeper and deeper into relaxation ...
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now again I will count ... but this time from one down to ten ... and this time as I count from one down to ten ... your mind will relax as your body is relaxed ... and with every count your body will double the relaxation it has at that time ... one ...your mind is relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body is doubling the relaxation it has at this time ... two ... your mind is relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body is doubling the relaxation it has at this time ... three ... the mind is relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body is doubling the relaxation it has at this time ... four ...
<br>
same thing ...five ... keep right on going ... six ... seven ... eight ... nine ...ten ...
<br>
your mind is completely relaxed as the body is relaxed and the body has doubled its relaxation many times over ...
<br>
<br>
You don't care what day it is ... you don't care what time it is ... you don't care about anything but how good you feel ... how wonderful you feel ... going deeper and deeper relaxed ...
<br>
<br>
Now I want you to go even deeper ... still deeper ... so this time double the relaxation you have in the body right now ... and when this is doubled I want you
<br>
to try to say "A" ...it only takes a few seconds ...you feel so good, so comfortable, so relaxed ... you don't even feel like saying "A" ...but now I want you to go deeper yet ... still deeper ... and when it is doubled ... try to say "B" ... again you feel so good, so comfortable, so relaxed ... that you don't even feel like saying "B" ... but now I want you to really let yourself go ... just as though you were on a spiral sliding board ... just sliding on DOWN to the basement of relaxation ... so again double the relaxation you have in your body at this time ...and when it is doubled then try to say "C" ... again you feel so good, so comfortable, so relaxed that you don't even feel like saying "C"...
<br>
<br>
So jusk keep on sinking DOWN deeper and deeper ... as I keep on talking the body just keeps right on sinking DOWN ... deeper and deeper ... into a wonderful...deep state of relaxation ... where the mind is passive ... and you feel wonderful ... where your arms are heavy ... where your legs are heavy ... very heavy ...very comfortable ... heavy feeling ... the arms and legs are so heavy, so comfortable, so relaxed that when I ask you to lift an arm or leg ... you'd find that they are so comfortable, so heavy, so relaxed that you don't feel like lifting them ... but nevertheless I want you to try to lift your left leg ...O.K. stop trying ... let it relax it feels so much better resting where it is ... it's so comfortable and you feel so good, so wonderful and so relaxed...
<br>
<br>
This will happen every day and every night ... and this wonderful good feeling will stay with you every day ... at all times ... deeper and deeper relaxed ... very deep ... very comfortable ... very relaxed ... such a wonderful ...comfortable ... feeling ...so loose ... so RELAXED ...you find that any time I say the words
<br>
"DEEPLY RELAX" to you ... immediately you will close your eyes and spontaneously go right back into this wonderful, deep, comfortable state of relaxation ... always enjoying it more and more ...
<br>
Always going deeper each time I work with you ... and every time I give you these positive suggestions, they will go deep into your subconscious mind ... they will be there when you need them ... every time I work with you it will reinforce all suggestions I have given to you before ... every day in every way you will be better and better, wiser and wise, happier and happier, healthier and healthier, feeling marvelous thoughout the day ...
<br>
<br>
Now I want you to pay attention to my voice and what I am going to teach you ... for I am ging to teach you to put yourself in this same state that you are in now, and this is how you will do it ...
<br>
<br>
First ... make sure you are comfortable and safe ...
<br>
Then ...set a time limit in you mind ...
<br>
Then ... close your eyes ...
<br>
<br>
Once your eyes are closed  ... take a deep breath and think 'RELAX', as you are letting your breath out ...
<br>
<br>
Then ... take another deep breath and think 'DEEPER' as you exhale ...
<br>
<br>
Then ... take another deep breath, and hold it for a moment ...Then as you let that breath out, think 'DEEPLY RELAX', .... already you can feel your body starting to relax ... DEEPER and DEEPER RELAXED ...
<br>
<br>
You will remain in this relaxed state for the amount of time you have set aside ... when that time has expired you will find yourself coming up and your eyes will automatically open ... you will feel refreshed, rejuvenated, wonderful and fine in every way, and all my suggestions tht I have ever given you ...That are beneficial to and positive to you will automatically be reinforced ... you will let this happen automatically and spontaneously ... going DEEPER and DEEPER RELAXED ... you will have good feelings and good thoughts at all times ...
<br>
<br>
AT THIS TIME POSITIVE VISUALIZATIONS

BRING YOUR SUBJECT(S) UP WITH THE FOLLOWING WORDING
<br>
<br>
On the count of one I will have you open your eyes ... on your own time ... you will be alert ... both mentally and physically ... you'll be rejuvenated ... you'll be happy, content and satisfied ... feeling marvelous in every way ... so, five ... gradually, slowly start coming up ... four ... coming up more and more ... three, coming up alert and refreshed ... two ... almost all the way up ... one ... on your own time, eyes open, all the way up, feeling wonderful and fine in every way!

Greetings Hypnotist,

Thank you very much indeed for this excellent post on hypnosis.

<br>
One question however, for those that cannot be hypnotised by someone else, I would suggest most, can this be modified for self hypnosis?

Hi people,
<br>
just a simple question for Frank if that is ok.
<br>
<br>
Frank said:
<br>
You don't actually need the Wave-1 CD either. You can formulate a mental rundown to some relaxing music, or create something using Brainwave Generator, or use whatever suits you. All I would advise is for you to create something of around 30 to 45 minutes duration which you are basically happy with then stick with it. In other words, don't make it too short, or too long, and no chopping and changing.
<br>
<br>
Would i be correct in thinking that a mental rundown is the relaxation process one uses to relax and still the mind and body while entering the trance state? and if so, any pointers on this would be greatfully received.
<br>
yours,
<br>
Dion.

<br>
<br>
The mental rundown is used as a kind of practice session, after which the person tries for real. It serves the purpose of getting a person into the habit of focussing their attention within themselves.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, when someone is a complete beginner, it is difficult for them to spark the process off. People try and "look within" and see nothing. In the event they just get disheartened thinking they can't do it. Which is why I suggest for people to first create an imaginary scenario. Then, after a while, situations will come about where you snap out of it thinking, "Hang on a minute, that wasn't on my script!"
<br>
<br>
Slowly but surely, a person will get used to these unexpected situations so they will be able to just passively observe them. At this point, a person crosses the bridge between just imagining and shifting their focus of attention for real.
<br>
<br>
Myself, I never think in terms of relaxing the physical body, or stilling the mind, or entering a kind of trance-state. I think all that is more to do with meditation rather than Astral projection. I think of it more in terms of mental focus.
<br>
<br>
When you focus your attention within yourself you automatically lose contact with your physical body. When you focus on a specific mental rundown, then you automatically drop all the day-to-day mental tittle-tattle that people can become preoccupied with. And as I've mentioned before a number of times, I cannot understand what people mean by "trance state".
<br>
<br>
I'm not knocking these concepts. The notion of entering a "trance state" or doing specific physical relaxation exercises, and so forth, may well work for some people. But with me, like I say, it all boils down to where you focus your attention.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I'm not sure if THIS part has come up before, is there a website anywhere that talks about phasing a bit? Like Frank says, I've been searching my way through the forums and the info I've found is invaluable but it takes more time than I usually have to refer to.

I doubt whether you will find a website on phasing as such, most sites tend to focus on OBE which is an entirely different thing.
<br>
<br>
There is a document in the file library which summarises the TMI phasing process. You might also want to take a look at Bruce Moen's website which is a sort of phasing which he calls "afterlife exploration". It seems to be very effective for people to bring back their own evidence of the afterlife, but it is not full phasing as such and isn't intended to be. The principle is identical however, a sequence of imagery leading into the Astral itself. The site is:

Greetings,

Here is a quote from one of the Adrian posts
<blockquote id='"quote"'>
 <font face='"Arial"' id='"quote"' size='"1"'>
  quote:
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
  The RTZ is actually an etheric projection rather than a full Astral projection, and is accordingly really a transient state between physical and Astral. Phasing is a projection of consciousness directly to the Astral via a series on intermediate states of consciousness, none of which appear to involve the etheric state.
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
Intermediate states/focuses as I see it, is a usage of your imaginery in a structured way to shift your consciousness from the physical body to astral. That`s why the method is called phasing.

Hello Adrian,
<br>
Hello Frank (if your back),
<br>
<br>
I know Adrian that you have followed closely this post and Frank's invaluable comments. I'm having a problem with the raising of eyes, and I would apreciate having your opinion on this.
<br>
<br>
I'm practicing this approach and two days ago saw the blackness and felt a spinning sensation, and felt very close but my excitement got the better of me and I came back to C.1.
<br>
<br>
What is bothering me is the raising of eyes upward and at the same time looking through the "third eye". Letting your consciousness rise, looking through the third eye but getting out through the crow chakra...Could you help me sort out all of this, or Frank if you're back ?
<br>
<br>
Frank wrote:   ..."But now I've realized that there is this Crown Chakra that sets the process off.""" (posted 7th april 2002)
<br>
<br>
Do you look at the brow or Crown ? The raising of consciousness also gives me difficulties in understanding what is meant. Does it come by itself, or does the raising of the eyes provoques it
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
<br>
Couldn't find answers reading the posts. Hope you can help me sort all of this out, or put the process in a sequence.

Dear experts:
<br>
<br>
0) A prologue note: Tactile Imaging is too aggressive, but drifting is too ineffective. Bad chemistry. Too much chemistry destroys the reaction, while too little prevents any reaction from happening. I'm still reaching a comfortable medium in between the two.
<br>
<br>
----
<br>
ORIGINALLY WHERE I STARTED
<br>
----
<br>
<br>
1) My appologies. I have not reviewed all the pages. But I a question . . .
<br>
<br>
2) . . . When I attempted some phasing practice last night, all my attention was drawn into the region of my brow chakra. Learning is a "sad" (figuratively) and slow process.
<br>
<br>
3) By drifting away, I speak of just letting the body relax. Staring ahead with your eyes closed is one thing, but staring out as if you were looking into the darkness with your brow is another. I'll list some things. You can interpret and give me insight.
<br>
<br>
a) Lay down, get mind set, hold blank state. Body begins to relax. My attention is spread out over my body.
<br>
b) Stare ahead, through Brow Chakra.
<br>
<br>
OBSTACLES: trying to keep my focus centered there. There's a challenging transition between "spread-out" awareness and having it centered in one place. I'm getting better, as you may notice, but my mind wants to pay attention to the rest of my body (i.e. spread itself out)
<br>
<br>
c) Focus becomes exceedingly centered at Brow Chakra
<br>
d) The black space seems to gain a sense of depth. Nothing's changed. I still haven't left the bed. I'm not outside of my body. I don't percieve myself--or in retrospect--to be close to "projecting"
<br>
<br>
NOTE: I'm confused with something. I find it hard to believe that I'm using astral sight, but at this point, I gain the sensation of spherical vision. If it is astral related, it is not sight. It's like sight, but I think it is more related to sensation, feeling, empathy -- sensing space. The confusion I'm experiencing causes me to misinterpret this sensation as sight-related, even though I am seeing nothing.
<br>
<br>
One could do this naturally when awake and not in a trance-like state. The difference, however, is clarity. It feels more natural in the above circumstances, more real, more clarified. It is like having it . . . versus trying to imagine, feel, or artifice the experience (i.e. like artificing pictures in your mind . . . versus actually seeing them when in a trance, or in a dream). When artificing sensations, there is a great feeling of limitation, but in trance, it feels like there is no limitation. My head is there, but it is like it isn't. Again, at this point, I am still in my body. I am still aware of my head. I am still in the 1st person mind-set. Symptoms have simply begun to present themselves.
<br>
<br>
e)WOOSH! All my attention is pulled right to my brow. I can literally say that I have, awaringly, unwillingly lost my spread out focus. Interesting things happen (Note: below). I've lost awareness of a lot of my body. It's hard to feel most of myself. I can no longer SENSE the shape of my body (I can some of it -- random parts and junk) nor can I sense any area to the sides of my head. The interesting thing is that I know that I cannot sense it, while being aware that I have lost that focus.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: I know this. But since my focus is usually spread-out and not compressed, achieving this state is somewhat of a "discpline" challenge.
<br>
<br>
f) I see something. It's like light, but not very bright. Faded, really. It's hard to even make it out. It moves like ripples in a pond. These "waves" oscillate inward from the side and are replaced by other ripples. I notice three or four. They move from bottom upward. They move from side inward. They curve in and disappear. They follow weird patterns. Silky waves.
<br>
<br>
g) I remember something I read and figure this is my que, a doorway, to get deeper. I remember people mentioning that they get pulled in to a tunnel. I don't know how to focus in, draw my focus in, or get deeper. It seems hard and impossible
<br>
<br>
h) I lose focus because I know my attention is spreading. In retrospect, I surmise that this came from a sudden spur of interest to get somewhere. Maybe a little excitement. The last I remember is being flustered by hypnogogic imagery and starting to black out into sleep. I eventually get up, but it's 45 min. after I started.
<br>
<br>
i) Upon opening my eyes and getting up, I feel like a different person. My eyes are heavy. My body is tired. It feels like I'm just getting up. Interesting, because moments ago I felt deeply relax, but not half-asleep.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Insight on all aspects would be great. Also, how am I doing, and how do I get moving? =(
<br>
<br>
Thanks
<br>

I think it's as "simple" as holding the thought of where you wanna go in your mind, and only that thought...  Of course, it's not that simple...
<br>
You could also try to spin, to see your hands, to create an object...  Experiment! [|)]
<br>
Try to focus on things that you know by heart; that you saw many times, like your house/school/office/...
<br>
Try to say "I want to see"...  If nothing happens, try to yell it...
<br>
Ask for help.
<br>
It all comes down to intent.  You have to intend it with all your will power...
<br>

Good luck!

Hi all,
<br>
<br>
I have a few of questions regarding phasing as apposed to AP'ing. Sorry if these have been raised and answered elsewhere but with such a vast amount of information on this forum i get lost in what i have and haven't read.
<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, here are my questions:-
<br>
<br>
1. With respect to AP i hear mention of relaxing, quietening the mind, energy raising and manipulation (NEW), exit techniques etc are required for an OBE. Am i correct in assuming that only the ability to relax and focus are required for phasing? I only ask as i have great difficulty at the moment with energy raising, and techniques such as 'the rope'. If phasing is simply about focusing, it sounds like a much easier approach.
<br>
<br>
2. From reading RB's books and reading postings by other members, it seems like it is difficult to hold an OBE for more than few minutes. Is this still true when phasing or can the experiences last longer?
<br>
<br>
3. Is memory recal (shadow memories etc) a problem when phasing as it is when AP'ing ?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
<br>
Matt.

Well, after reaching that period where " vibrations" are felt before exiting the body I heard a voice which spoke to me saying that it was " the ancient god of fire" and that he'd assist me with anything that I wanted to learn. The voice was kinda scary, but I knew it was a chance to astral project so I asked to help to ' get me out'.. The voice then began to say who he was and what I should do to ' get out of my body'... I cannot rmemebr half of the things he sed. He even sed his name, but I couldnt rmemebr it ( of course I went online to search "gods of fire" to see if any name would ring a bell.. but there were too many names that came up.) ANyway, when i followed the voice's instructions, I felt my "astral" head beginning to rise.. I then got scared cuz I felt an intense HEAT feeling on my head and I had to force myself to 'get up from the paralysed stage'... the heat scared me cuz I was thinking " god of fire...-heat...-hell"..... AFter that experience a month ago, I never had anything "astrally" again. I was thinking to try that "sitting down on a chair" method, but I KNOW it's too difficult for me to 'fall sleep' on a chair... It's also hard for me to fall asleep on my back... so are there any other methods where I can reach that 'relaxed stage " to astral project?

 OK,
 <br>
 Here's what I do. First I write a definite "intent" on a piece of paper. This is where I want to go or what I wish to accomplish. I feel that this notifies my subconscious. I then get barefoot with both feet flat on the floor, feet close together. I place my hands palms down in my lap, usually one on each thigh..I may or may not listen to Hemi- or Holo-Sync. I relax and concentrate on the darkness behind my eyes and keeping my breathing at a slow steady pace. I feel as though I am waiting....expecting to soon see the colors that begin to swirl into the darkness behind my eyes.
 <br>
 At the same time I "feel" my third eye and crown chakra become active, or opening. This stage usually begins after about 20 minutes when the natural chemical reactions to the darkness begin ( much like going to sleep).
 <br>
 Once the colors Begin to swirl, (violet,dark blue, white and gold) it is not long before a tunnel forms. I then begin to move my consciousness into and through this tunnel to arrive at my intended purpose or destination. Often, if I have requested a guide, this is when I will meet my guide.
 <br>
 Upon returning to my body I will feel the "vibrations" others speak of when they exit, but I do not experience them upon my exit. I do have a "body" there and can even change my clothing with a "thought" in an instant. I can communicate with others and have all of my senses, plus the ability to fly and the ability to focus my vision on a distant scene and bring it into a magnified focus (as if it were right in front of me).  I have the ability to speak with those who have passed over in death, see and touch them too.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have experienced many interesting and creative adventures using the
 <br>
 above method.

I'm trying to put all the information here in a comprehensive way for me. Read on the different topics about "Focus", phasing, 3D blackness, listening to different CD...
<br>
<br>
I'm beginning to have a good idea on the process somewhat.
<br>
<br>
Could Donna, or any other here put together the basic and the means of getting to the 3D blackness.  I'm thinking of putting the body in the correct state to get to Focus 10 Mind-awake/body-asleep. Just practice with the CD?  Use relaxation techniques for the body?  Raise energy?
<br>
<br>
There's mixed messages depending on which posts you read.
<br>
<br>
Donna here seems to just close her eyes, look at the blackness in front of here and eventually "get there".
<br>
<br>
I've read the post of Major Tom (Focus 10); a few posts of Frank (the mental rundown for one).
<br>
<br>
What are the prerequisites?

 I often simply go into alternate states of conciousness without the help of the tapes. Though I learned that the connection that is formed between the right and left hemespheres of the brain with using the tapes is permanent.

I was careful to use them as prescribed by Monroe Institute to gain this permanent bridge between the spheres of my brain.

Really, I want to be able to achieve this "permanent connection".
