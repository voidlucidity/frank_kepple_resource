<section>
Astral planes as you call it is nothing more then minds suspended in and connected by the ambient magnetic field generated by the earth itself. Through this field an electro/magnetic anaomalie such as consiousness can be suspended, perhaps indefinitly. As to weather, and geography effecting astral projecting let it be said that if your sufficently heavy in water you sink, but if the water is denser you float. So electro magnetically redundant enviroments limit the ablitity to be suspended in this magnetic field, but electro magentically dense can help you float, but if it is too ie sitting next the a generators turbine fueled by nucleaur heat, youll proabbly cause you electro magnetic anaomliy to destablize or implode if it leaves it set body.
<br>
<br>
You weight can be lowered by being experinced.  Making certain magnetic situations can cut an area off, there after inhibiting entry and exit for a psyic magnetic wave rider. ie copper grilling in a room.
<br>
<br>
the qualities of electro magnetic enviroment..
<br>
electro magnetically dense enviroments can be generated as a so step out of the body, ie large hot bath with iron tub help to draw you out of body but may be to dense and youll be attracted into the iron of bath. best to sit on static proof rubber matt to project. ie rubber matt with flour sprinkled on it.
<br>
<br>
The electro magnetic field is stronger in certain areas and due to its nature has currents. currents are both good and bad as strong ones whick you away quickly perhaps to be absorbed, and destroyed in monumental magnetic forces in center of earth, or to be safely put back in your body after a few cycles. again use common sense.
<br>
<br>
As to different "plains".
<br>
the subconious is also interconnected by the ambient magnetic field. as to evil or good just depends what part of the collective subocnsious your roaming, but the subconsious or "plains" are also limited to densly pupulated areas. go to deserted area and prject you end up simply suspended in magnetic field without all the fantasy geography of "plains". type of subconsious is different as to which culture of the area your in. Aswell for advice. is that subconsious are really just hyper abstractions of what the simple people interprit at good and bad. like bad parents will be super exaggerated untill its something like an all powerful tyrant king in the sibconsious of child, of physically abused women amd alcholic man.  but remember these are just monkeys functioning in a social hierachy. like alpah male and female submission will have ramafications in the subconsious, but in the ned its just monkeys.
<br>
<br>
As to evil god, bad gods..
<br>
emotion ripples through subconsious like wave, some how becomesa singularity, therefore quantifies and becomes independent. ie develop self consiousness or motive , or varying degrees of both. they can leave the subconsious "plains", but are rarely found outside of densely populated areas. As to struggels for dominance between them well, just ask which is the must common emotion/ thing that has ramafactions on subconsious&gt;&gt;&gt; desire. so god of desire is winning of course. they are not majestic or all powerful, takes a simple counter association for a kid not to desire apples after biting into apples with worm in it. so it is truw with all desires in that kid. and with all individuals. counter assocaitons are generated by knowledge.
<br>
<br>
the holistic truth is that "they" are nothing more then elctro magnetic anamalies, ie energy in motion, if you get them to be still there would be no difference between them and ambient enrgy and they would die.
<br>
<br>
as to chi.
<br>
differenc between chi and electro magentic energy is that of sea water and steam. chi is processed to have much energy potential so its relation to magnetic fields is like a watch battery to a car battery, or perhaps a small powerstation and a watch battery. in this way is it no possible for "them" to simly process ambien wave field for food, they need chi,a nd they steal it since that can not manafacture chi by digesting cornflakes. however it is possible to be sustained perhaps indefinitly on more highly charge ambien enrgy.. liek you find in windy areas.
<br>
<br>
..as to wind fire water and earth..
<br>
<br>
wind is hot air up cold air down..pressure inequality generating movement. hot and cold are elctrical qualties. use common sense.
<br>
<br>
fire again generates positve field which attracts cold field, ie suck ambient energy towards it.
<br>
<br>
water is a better conducter then air, but dosent imply its got more charg automatically, ie air with wind, and water in rubber flask buried polythene antis static wont have any charge. howver since its a better conducter in a natrual situation water will acentuate the earths natrual magnetic field. however it has exactly the same effect on the magnetic anaomily of consiouss as the body. air is less dense and easier to move around in, and exerts less force so the skeleton of body dosent need super strength. same with mind in air, vice versa with body in water, vice versa with mind in water.
<br>
<br>
as to "its fantastic to fly around and hop into people/animals mind, and make stuff move with my astral body" mentality. dont be ridculous.
<br>
More power dosent me you have more reason to do stuff. like babies and ballons, they think its great wehe! they think i can make it go up, but now your big and let even colourful ballons stay on the ground unmolested by your impulse, and instinct to exert control. same with making people pick there own noses by astral suggestion or even bodily take over.
<br>
<br>
side note&gt; powers not just used for random fun, but also for power, exploitation, and the rest. and not just by humans.
<br>
<br>
current state of socila politicalaffairs so far..
<br>
big ones repress consious development in little ones, big ones worhsip big astral eagle eagle who makes them blind.
<br>
<br>
current state ot my phsyic theory .. not that important ill do it later perhaps..
<br>
<br>
edit1&gt;contunation
<br>
<br>
to do with auras..
<br>
alls cells are ruglauted by a celluar magnetig field which forms a medium of magneticsignals stimulating certainc elluar actions, all cllluar magentic fields combine to form an aura, aswell sub auras to do with specif area or organs.&lt; this is how cells regulate a function, but the ceel function is to produce chi, chi is channeled to mind through aura but it is not initself same as aura.when you say im being sucked or sharing energy, you saying im sharing chi. if you can see "aura" you will be noticng it is stripy with striped moving in various directiosn or one directions depending on situation. aura is usually backround colour like purple. chi is stripe like yello. sometimes its all purple with littel baby blobs of yellp going ouy from center, or going to center. sometimes its all yellow!
<br>
<br>
however forget everything i said, this is just interpritation, methodical categorization of knowledge. this is a divison of the universe, universe is infinite, and infinity can not be divided. thusly all there is infinity. then we find that reality settels down to the prsent. then we find consiouss observer. if the identity is the individual, and idenity is machine logic bult upon the gears of logical knowledge then once you dont interprit you dont have identity, and you become universal consiousness.
<br>
if choice is good choice conquering over the bad choice, then if good and bad dont exist since we dont interprit then choice dosent exist. so we are only observers. once observers do not make mistake of observing this reality, perhaps evenw ithpout human bias, and you are mathemathical, as you surely regenerate and idenitity, even if its destroyed after. no
<br>
<br>
once observer, you must stop interpriting remove division untill it is only the observer, observing the object. object being infinity. then realize that infinity implies "space", and space implies dimensoanality, ie the a division of hieght and width, and volume. this isnt true.
<br>
<br>
then from there i can no longer describe. the observer without object, is not an observer. there is however two possible situations, the observer observes the observer "ultimate consiousness of paradoxial division and therefore of non reality"(the desire to exist) and then no observer so the very fabric of the universe becomes you, or it is you and you return to it.
<br>
<br>
so trully if we look back at the astral practical jokes, golden sword  battles with arch demons, angels and even the fabric of astrality itself we realize that trully all action is derived from moitve. all motive from an identity. so even all idenity is derived from instinct. so batteling is trully an instinctual act, and since a demon is a creation of the subconious, howvere self aware it is, all we are doing wheather battling or channeling is simply being stuck in non consiousness/ subconsiousness and instinctuality. so no forget astrality as anything other then an extension of the phsycial infinity. a structure wheather phsycial or metaphysicall is just an interpration from the rest of infinity, values such as good and bad are riduclous.
<br>
......................................................................
<br>
<br>
<br>
As to my own fate:
<br>
i had recently posted witht he topic infinity as delusion, but deleted my posts as they were the outward manifestation of an identity, and aided only to support, an identity. However while still within a self regulating society suck as is predominante in england i can not preferom the ultimate metamorphosis. that of becoming god, if you are faimilliar with gnoticism this post if you anway, an no im not talk about the astral entities that roam the "plains" and exert such control over the small ones. im talking about universal consiousness.
<br>
<br>
i can not adivse, and i my self preferom the metamorphosis within civilzation. Civlization is nothin more then a collective identity, and an idenity is just a machine. so if we take the parrle of "windows" we find that we are all programs constructing and governed by a mother program which ha sits foundations is the smaller programs it controlls&gt; ie it is regulating itself. self regualting civilzation has anti bodies such as police, to remove any programs which dont belong. when you become wihtout idenity, you are interprited as faulty program and deleted or recyc;ed. or quarenteend.
<br>
<br>
so i suggest you leave or forms of self regulating civilzation ie, anything with rules implented by anyform of coersion. i myself pla to go to mongolia. i dont know how many have already succesfully finished the ultimate metamorphosis, however it seems correct to say it is not nirvana. to explain the difference with knowledge is not is easy and i put it down in my previous posts and a relativly understandable way.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;so im hoping they can be retrieved.. i need an idenity to surivive in society untill i can leave, so id prefer to have an idenity about this then to enjoy cars and television
<br>
<br>
the following are notes for me untill i know wheather they can be reitrieved by the website controllers..if they can not i will elaborate..
<br>
<br>
infinity, time drag creates fractal forms, forms evovle to machine, machine evovle to sense&gt; sense evovle to instinct&gt;(emotion is first born then astral god created) instinct to identity(knowledge??apple&gt;&gt;&gt; idenity ti infinity&gt; infinity to coniosness(no control by astral gods, they dont like so they want to stop)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<br>
&gt;moving and non moving energy
<br>
non moving attract moving due to path of lest ristence is favoured
<br>
&gt;moving is ovious emotion, or astral being&gt;
<br>
neutralies reabsorbed into ambient and therefore start to move like recycled&gt; this is buddist nrivana( return to body)
<br>
<br>
current astral geography is movement around big neitruality but not in it to stop it growing. neutrality is big uncourrptible ambiment energy&gt; movement is spin because gods controls, control because they want to exist, want is desire and can be destroyed by reason with infinity knowledge.
<br>
<br>
&gt;ultimate metamorphosis&gt; told by good, and bad beings will stop spin for all astrality. humanity wake up..no i told you it is death of everything.. why beause all knowledge and all identiy even higher instincts are held in the medium of natruall magnetic field..so if you completely calm it then what idenentiy will be consious of existence, and there fore there will be no existence because there will be no observer. so i make universal consiousness in all minds, by i myself become univesally consiouss...wont lower instincts create emotion and start spin.. no because the universal consiousness will be suspended in all magnetif fields, so spin will be simply reabsorbed..and this actually happens.. yes depending.. you said the process restarts.. yes because when there is no more spin to define neutraity there is no neutraily, only oblivion.. wait wait so i stop all electro magnetic anaomlies in the all the heads of all animals.. there are no animals if you dont interprit them..and you dont interpit them if i freed form interpritation and univerally conious i see, so the neutrality isnt lmited to the earth magnetic field.. no esssentially you generate a gravition bomb from the earths natruall magnetif field and destroy time space infinitly.. what time space..ha you see it know dont  you..yess.. and your one of two or one of none..
<br>
yes yes..but if we must know then im one of two, the other is another.. who.. choose..no.who..you know it its your higher identity, then you are the rebel if the other is my higher idenity..what rebel like i explained guilty action and sin are riduclous concepts.. who gave me a cold.. not me buddy, you dont manafacture enough chi to power your own bodily defences, too much stress, i suggest you relax..
<br>
just type it in to see if this is not just some randomly occuring delusion but some objective reality, ha all interpriation even if widley accepted is only as you know delusion. but go ahead.

<section>
perhaps yes.. but it actually takes a great deal of motivation to generate a delusion. i feel delusion slipping away, i focus on the present&lt; unwillingly ofcourse, and find that the knwoeldge which defiens my reality starts to slip away, and ultimately all i want know is what is happening to me, or mre pricisly is where am i going.. and if im not going anywhere an im a hicup in zerod imensonal energy, then what process of creation or destruction is being under taken by finding reality?
<br>
<br>
all the rest about destroying astrality is just stuff im being told, or that im going crazy, and that my deep down arragonce is searching for away to justify itself by creating this fantasy of an entity which communicates with me bygiving me concepts but not exactly talking to me. so im just looking for a clear opnion on whats happenging when i let go of the most fundemental desire to exist as a consiousness, and that if do let go do i create electro magnetic wave, in astrality which has the culiminatign effect of a scalar electro magnetic pulse which also detonates the earth as a graviton bomb? and why do i understand how to play the japenede game of go withou ever hearing about it before. as well as have plans in my head for anti gravitation and ehter vibratiosn bombs, and why do i understand what the plans are for?
<br>
<br>
yeh tell me that, as im not going to accept the i aleardy know thing from any force i only hear. and yes i am asking for the answers in terms of applicable yet interitable knowledge, the type in which i communicated you the question, not i already know this is interpritation and delusion. ultimately the answer wouldnt change a thing, i dont desire anything to except to not desire, yet for the sake of relaxation then just sooth my nervers. because letting go of delusion is not astral projecting. as the process involved isnt the same.

<section>
however i believe if this being is infact a geing and not some egoistic delsion, then yes electro magnetic anaomaliey of consiousness, natrually vibrates so asto interact with the maegnetic field, astral plrojection is simply becoming consious of that, however it can vibrate at differen physical pitches..it can vibrate at atomical solid pitch and materialze, so if you leave the body and enter the supportive medium of astrality(natrual earth magnetism) you can form there creat an exact duplicate of you physical self in the ohysical world by making yourslef or a projection of yourself back at th ephysical vibration. i also understand if the entity it not madness, and it also correct that we can vibrate a various lower or higher pitchs so that gravity has more less hold of us and can physically fly aswell as pass though walls at the vibration of radiation. this is more less backed up by stories of physical manifestations...however there is always doubt, and would have to take immense meantal strenght and so much energy.
<br>
<br>
but perhaps finding reality causes the mind to vibrate at the frequency of ambient ether. and the entity simply says its a problem with me because instead of collapsing the divison between ambient ether and consiousness and there fore de stabilzing, i actually grow causing the rest to become ether. i do pick indiscrepencies in my story aswell, so its not that i cause a gravitation bomb from the earths natrual fields its just that i disolve ether space then..anythign to say..in truth i dont know what happens..but its certain oblivion..or perhaps your not saying anything true and are simply manipulatign me to some end..how can i manipulate someone without motive..i have motvie to leave civilzation..if i wanted to kill i owuld have made you do it..not kill but take possession of my body when i leave it..its a possiblity , and there fore a risk you will have to take if you got to mongolia..do you deny you want to take possision of my body..&gt;
<br>
&gt; no answer
<br>
<br>
i can only assume the dialouge was a fantasy of my own mind, or perhaps it can not answer in distruth to me and prefers not to speak.
<br>
my mind is blanking out right now..and my back,a nd th eback of my head is feeling intense heat, and i feel light headed by a fighting successfully whatever is happening astrally, if it is an attempted take over. however i will need to sleep and i doubt i can defend myself then so pleas help out..

<section>
Funnily enough, I do have one story that's been in progress for a few years that involves a type of astral projection that's entirely based on electromagnetic fields - you 'project' by firing as many neurons as possible to intensify your body's field, then drop the activity suddenly to almost nothing, and an electromagnetic field with your brain 'imprinted' in it buzzes free of your body.
<br>
<br>
Then it mooches around in physical space, or 'tunes in' to the telepathic frequency and moves to the 'astral' world.
<br>
<br>
It makes for some interesting ideas, but I'm not convinced that's how it works in real life. For starters, it would mean an APer could easily affect a compass needle...
<br>
<br>
There's a book (I forget the author) called "The dragon and the unicorn" which has the same premise &amp; applies it to the legend of Kind Arthur - it's a good story.

actually if we are a hicup in zero dimensonal energy, that slowly is duped by knowledge derived directly or indirectly from instinct into interpriting, and slowly gather our wits in the present, and then from thier trancend back to our pure zero dimensonal hicup self, or is it simply a case that it is a paradox in knowledge which generates consiousness. after knowing this then you must admit its not reality that is the problem, is from which point of view you observe it. In the end it dosent matter.
<br>
all i know is reality is round the corner and its running after me as fast as i can run from it, for if i turn and reunite with it here and now in public, then the mechanical civilization, governened by mechanical astral beings, will catch me by the throat and choke consiousness sweet salvia that permeated my being when reality frenched me.. However that is not my question.. i dont give a dam about the consequences of my finding reality, wheater a demon or delusion believes i cause oblivion. im asking you know what happens when i trancend knowledge of the infinity, become consious of the non dimensional?
<br>
<br>
After that my question is how do i stop being possessed by an astral entity. i odnt believe its a totally bad one, but if i stop being busy my head starts nooding gently back and forth and i feel light headed. aswell as everynow and then it tries it full own blanking my mind and then a feel intense heat on my back. but i dont snap, no fear you see. or perhaps it isnt a possession? and ive gone deaf in my right ear very suddenly. aswell as i see the misty outlines of waving infront of my eyes as i type this.and general pokes and prods and slaps. help please.

i figured it out i believe that  identity is simply being posed by a mega powerful god of desire, that when your freed he sends negs at you. but all to no avail as disbelief in negs causes them not to exist in immediate situation. like you exploded them into ambient space energy.

You don't have the faculties needed to comprehend infinity.
<br>
<br>
But think of it like this, There is God, he was the first and the last. and his whole creation is in between.
<br>
<br>
He is the Odd and his creation is the even.

<section>
so infinity and god are one for you. infinity has no center, and in itself is a paradoxial concept. infinity means nothing ness. however contemplation of centerless leads only to the realization of consiousness. but must be discarded since all is non dimensional.
<br>
<br>
yeh so your saying god has idenity by saying he had motive to create..
<br>
shut up
<br>
i already no the gods which have desire and function in the astral did not create the physical or the super physical" zero dimensinal consiousness", all your gods and demons are nothing more then abstractions of pre existing instinctual human social institutions. all social institutions have that black and white divisoin directly dervied from pain an dpleasure. they may have gathererd a form of self consiousness and even motive to continue there existence but they remain unevolved if a little abstracted and mythologgized creations of the subconsious. even if they existed in the astral before us nothing changes at to the state of affairs of the there foundation less philsophical justifications unto themselves.
<br>
<br>
No and dont say zero dimensional energy has motive look at the anarchy of grass which breaks up a path, or the very stars the manage to pierce through th light pollution . they fails to keep rational rules. And then forget places there is only one here and that is infinity. if god is universal consousness then he has no motive, as that as they say is the vine which must be destroyed. I dont want a lecture from mormons are witchs alchemists or worlocks. yes yes you may be very clever and figured out ways to manipulate energy and cause ripples through it for desired effects, but you still cant justify unto yourself why you do it. all i want to know is what happens when i find reality, as reality is running after me .
