Hey everyone, I'm Ridion (the name gives it away i'm sure).
<br>
I've been practicing psionics for about 6 months or so, naturally there have been breaks over these months. I started off by trying some of the wingmakers training exersizes, then moved onto the psipog website. I am one who deals as much as he can with light energy. I meditate nightly and try to communicate with nature on a regular basis. I have some ability in healing and am quite good with empathy. I've been able to Project and everything but i now feel that I've reached a barrier and want to try something new. I hope advice i give people is useful and I'm really impressed by this great community you have here.
