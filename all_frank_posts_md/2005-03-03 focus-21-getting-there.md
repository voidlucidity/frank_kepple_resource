<section>
I've been getting to 12, no probs in under half and hour but I haven't been able to get to 21 since the first time I got there by pure accident.  Is there anyway to get there aside from one of those 'it just happens' things?
<br>
<br>
Any advice is helpful.

My other favorite answer which I'm getting a lot these days is that I'll succeed when I'm ready for it.

It's 99% certain you are not in the full focus 12 state, perhaps just a deep Focus 10. Please tell me what you are experiencing in what you say is F12.

Hi Andali27, can you share me what technique you are using for achieving that state. I have been getting to F10 accidentally and since that I have no success.
<br>
<br>
And does anyone have success with bwgen to achieve this state?
<br>
<br>
Thanks

Sorry it's taken so long to reply.  Okay.
<br>
<br>
Frank, in Focus 12, I perceive sometimes swirling colors, sometimes just flashes of color, mostly that start from the edge of my eyes and travel out or in.  They usually fade after a few minuets and I end up back in F-10.  That's what I see.

This sounds to me to be a light Focus 12. For some reason you are curtailing the experience. The most common reason for that is apprehension of some kind. You need to observe yourself very carefully when at this stage. Does your breathing quicken a little? Do you get a little nervous? Or something like that.
<br>
<br>
As you make the transition to Focus 21 you should feel your energy centres working. Particularly your Yellow centre in an interaction with the Purple (if you don't then don't worry because not everyone does). The former feels like a tingling in your belly and in your head you may hear or sense some kind of buzzing or light vibrating sensation.
<br>
<br>
Now, any tension in your abdomen can prevent the yellow centre from coming alive, so to speak. The Yellow centre is your emotional centre, so that is why any kind of slight nervousness can put a spoke in the works and keep you grounded to the physical.
<br>
<br>
Before entering Focus 10, try doing some basic breathing exercises to relax the muscles in your abdomen. Try taking deep breaths
<i>
 out
</i>
as much as you can then release, and breathe in deeply then concentrate on breathing fully out again and repeat for 10 times or so, then breathe deeply as normal. Also try doing a few basic stretches that involve the muscles of the abdomen. Plus, do a little stretching of your neck.
<br>
<br>
I'm guessing as to what it might be. But if someone asked me to bet on it, then I'd bet on physical tension either in the abdomen or the neck, or some kind of slight nervousness that was thwarting you and preventing you from going deeper. The realisation of entering the Focus 21 state is pretty awesome, so a little nervous tension coming about at the thought of doing it again would only be natural in my view.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Eeep!  Couldn't get on this morning, the forum was down from my end.  Okay, thanks for the tips Frank, I'll give them a go tonight.
<br>
<br>
What usually happenes now, is I get to F10 and pretty much what you deam, the edge of F12, a rather light one.

<br>
Actually, it varies.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  My heart tends to beat harder but not faster.  I can feel it beating and it rather annoys me.
<br>
<br>
I get these weird 'waves' over my body occassionally and feel this kind of bubbly feeling near my stomach, that's rather nice, though sometimes I think it's food digesting but usually, it isn't.
<br>
<br>
I'm not nervous, probably, when I get into a deep F10, I end up thinking setting up expectations on how it should come about again.  I wasn't afraid the first time I was in F21.  I was enthralled and happy.
<br>
<br>
Nervous tension probably may be the reason (though I think it'd be subconsious, what term do you use, F2?)
<br>
<br>
I'm not consciously afraid as far as I know.
<br>
<br>
Hmm, what do you make of that?  Again, thanks for the help.
