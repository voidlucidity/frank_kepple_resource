<section>
there's been a lot of talk and debate over planet x or nibiru, but the face and pyramids on mars are often forgotten in posts.
<br>
<br>
here are some pictures i've gathered with some links at the bottom of the post. some of these were also included on posts in the obe experiences forum (

<section>
heph, you might want to refine your theory a little; there are some big holes.
<br>
<br>
"Earth and Mars were somewhat Twin planets, on Earth there was early man but on mars there was a thriving civilisation, this civilisation came under threat from the 4th planet, this planet was located between Earth and Mars"
<br>
<br>
how did the same life divide between the two planets?
<br>
<br>
"this planet was located between Earth and Mars, its chaotic gravitational effect destroyed Mars entire environment"
<br>
<br>
gravitational effects wouldn't deplete a planet of oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. what little oxygen mars ever had has been in its water supply. life would have to evolve within already-created, oxygen-filled buildings. the 'facility' in the pictures in my first post hints at such a building, only i doubt life evolved there. it was obviously built by something that later landed on the planet.
<br>
<br>
"the civilisation relocated to Nibiru and the 4th planet broke up into the asteroid belt due to its chaotic gravity"
<br>
<br>
nibiru isn't such an easy planet to relocate to, with its huge orbit. they would have to be extremely lucky to catch the planet right as they were about to die. and as far as the asteroid belt.. the asteroid belt is *outside* of the orbit of mars, between mars and jupiter rather than earth and mars. the planet that the asteroid belt was created from was destroyed by an impact before earth even existed, because earth used to be a part of that planet.
<br>
<br>
"the people of Nibiru visted Earth and genetically modified early man to become who we are today, they then came to Earth and took up temporary long term residence and proclaimed themselves as Gods so they could use humans as slaves to mine for Gold which was in very large quantity on earth which they used to help their civilisation rebuild on Nibiru."
<br>
<br>
you're referring to the annunaki here, and the information on the annunaki originated from ancient sumeria. the sumerians did *not* refer to the annunaki as gods, but simply divine. they didn't worship them as gods, either. they came here for gold, but to reinforce their atmosphere to be better heated so as to support life on the surface rather than strictly underground. they did genetically engineer early man, according to the sumerians, which was where the biblical tale of creation came from (god created man from the 'clay of the earth'), and did for a short period use us as slave workers, until we gathered enough sense for ourselves to be treated humanely. the annunaki were later called back to nibiru after civil wars broke out among the different lines of the annunaki.

lmao... personally, i disagree with a lot of the things hoagland says, especially regarding nibiru. he thinks nibiru is some elaborate hoax (non-existant) designed to take attention off of what's clearly visible on mars. however, he can't explain how those things came to be on mars, or where they went.
<br>
<br>
but though hoagland may have some hole-ridden ideas, those pictures speak for themselves (except for the 'infared' ones... streets and buildings? pfft..). just ignore the name hoagland that appears on them. lol [

the reason why all this is being hidden from the general public is because we are heading to the same demise was our Martian forebears. The powers that govern on Earth do not know or are unwilling to stear our ways from this disaster. Of course, they don't want the natives to get restless.

"about my question: looking at those pictures again, I noticed the buried ruins of "cydonia".Interesting-does anyone know whether those kind of strictly geometric formations could occur w/out intelligent intervention.could they just be totally natural?"
<br>
<br>
look at the pyramids and the face. the pyramids are at such a steep angle.. and the detail of the face.. the only natural feature on mars that could cause that is wind or a volcano. do you think either would have that much precision? the wind would have to be blowing in all sort of directions constantly to create the shapes, but the only thing the wind has done is erode what was already made by the annunaki.
<br>
<br>
"the reason why all this is being hidden from the general public is because we are heading to the same demise was our Martian forebears. The powers that govern on Earth do not know or are unwilling to stear our ways from this disaster. Of course, they don't want the natives to get restless."
<br>
<br>
sounds like hoagland. there are certain people that know of the civilization on mars, mainly US and egyptian government officials. they've even extracted things from the pyramids and had them transported back to washington/cairo. they probably will be releasing more to us in the upcoming years, or they at least should. learning of an alien race that's coming to kill you is one thing, but learning of one that existed on a neighbor planet hundreds of thousands years ago would do nothing but spark curiosity. thus, there is no harm in it.
<br>
<br>
mars was abandoned when the earth missions were abandoned, due to civil war among the annunaki.

I don't proclaim to know what is or is not on the surface, or under it, of Mars. However I once found some interesting things conserning Mars. Â The Mars orbital does nothing but send back pictures of Mars, and because of this Mars is pretty well mapped out. Â On one fly by a small white dot appeared in one of the photos. Â Originally it was thought to be dust or something that had gotten on the lense. Â But it was not in any of the following photos, nor was it in the following photos of that one area.
<br>
<br>
Well, one of the remote viewing schools had gotten the photos and did 3 different viewing sessions with multiple subjects. Â They each did one before, durring, and after the "dot" was in the photo. Â Each and every one of them returned the same types of responces. Â Before the photo there was pretty much nothing, as well as after. Â But durring the time when the "dot" was there they all got an emotional reading from the session. Â Provided the information gotten from the RVer's is true and accurate then at that point in time there was something on mars, and it new it was being watched, ie. from the satalite.
<br>
<br>
I have to look for that site.

Excellent Pics. Â I don't claim to know their authenticity, but they are thought provoking all the same. Â Talking with people who have been researching this scenario since the time that the Cydonia pics first came to light, I was amazed to learn just a couple of things.
<br>
<br>
One of the pyramid shapes that we see is a five sided pyramid, and apparently there is no way in hell that this particular object could be created by natural forces. Â And that rings very true for me.
<br>
<br>
Some of the other pics you supplied No_leaf would also seem to benefit from this same argument. The fact that so many very unusual objects are found only within this region on Mars would seem to lend proof to the hypothesis that nature could not create these things. That of course leaves one explanation with thousands of possibilities. Â And that is that they are not natural phenomena and were created by some intelligent force. Who or what was that force I can't even hazard a guess.
<br>
<br>
And I do think that the idea of projecting to the Mars surface would be very interesting indeed. Â I believe that in some of the remote viewing information, that this has already been done back in the sixties or seventies by the U.S. military. So maybe a return visit is in order.
<br>
<br>
Have you seen the Russian footage from two of their early probes to Mars ? Â One probe simply 'goes offline' while the other records a very large shadow crossing the Martian surface seconds before the camera views a huge disc approaching, and then the second probe 'went offline'. Â I can't provide a link for you, as the video came to the UFO research group a few years ago and was duly returned to it's owner once we viewed it. Â But I am sure that somewhere on the net you will find it.
<br>
<br>
Damn good topic No_leaf, thanks for posting it.

you should be able to project there just by focusing on those pics, but i wouldn't really know anything about that.
<br>
<br>
that'd be an interesting video to watch, tayesin. i'll keep a look out for it on google and winmx, keeping in mind that a lot of videos out there have been tampered with. more recently, a US probe has gone offline simply because it wasnt able to convert metric to standard measurements. that sounds a bit fishy to me.. they've been able to overcome worse problems in the past, such as lenses and etc not being able to open. a mere problem with conversions? more like they wanted to get attention off of it.

well, the 'face' actually isn't a face. The picture on the first page is from 1976 (or is that wrong?). There are 'better' and sharper pictures at a higher resultion from 1998 and 2001. And theres not much of a face left.

<section>
Ok, let's go off of the 2001 pic since it was most recent. I don't know what was going on in 1998. The atmosphere seems to have had some role in that pic.
<br>
<br>
Even though the fact that the pic is much clearer than the one in 1976 takes away a lot of the face's features (because the one is 1976 is more blurred together), it's the same face, and just as mysterious and unexplainable.
<br>
<br>
On the left side of the face you can clearly make out an eye socket and the nose ridge which is beside it. You can also make out the plain area where the mouth once was. The other side isn't so clear, but if you back away from your computer and look at it from a couple feet back, you can see past the hundreds of years of weathering and look at the face in general, and you can make out
<i>
 both
</i>
eyes (shadowed, depressed areas), and the whole nose area (raised land) easily.
<br>
<br>
All the unclear spots are products of possibly hundreds of thousands of years of weathering by wind. The first landing on Earth by the Annunaki was back over one hundred thousand years ago, which suggests the base on Mars was up and functioning by then, or else they, for some reason, degressed in fuel technology, which isn't likely.
<br>
<br>
Notice how the land bordering the face rises up and then suddenly stops. From there, the ground is
<i>
 relatively
</i>
flat (compared to the rising land on the borders, which, on one side, are nearly perfect), but rises in places to hint that there were indeed more detailed facial features in times past. This, of course, was caused by wind.
<br>
<br>
Even without a closer look at the face, describing exactly how the wind alone would cause that would be difficult if not impossible. There are no tectonic plates on Mars. Only wind, and dead volcanos. The face is not a volcano. The area around the face is mostly completely flat,
<i>
 except for mysterious pyramid shapes that also defy reasonable explanation
</i>
. Now, all this would suddenly make sense if you were to say that the pyramids and face weren't created by the wind on Mars, but were
<i>
 eroded
</i>
by it.
<br>
<br>
Try to find such detailed and up-to-date photos of the Pyramids of Mars. NASA seems to have a hard time shooting detailed pics of those areas. [8D]

I was at a website which had new picks of the City and the Complex. The city is made of some wierd Glass, they got some pics with the sides of it reflecting off the Sun. If I find it again I will post it here..

K, I found the link. They are also claiming the metal things were near the landing site.
<br>
Here check it out

<section>
those mars picture are very interesting, is there any recent pics of the pyramids?
<br>
<br>
I remember seeing a "recent" pic of the mars face and it looked like nothing, im sure there is something beyond what nasa is telling us,
<br>
<br>
its not just a coincidence that the meteor alh84001 (and various others) where found to have organic compounds and what seemed like fossilized bacteria
<br>
<br>
mars is an enigma, and untill we can step on its surface we are doing nothing but confusing ourselves even more
<br>
<br>
Im almost certain that there is some sort of life on the majority of the planets in our solar system, bacteria or what ever, Â I think there even could be a "pure energy" lifeform existing on the gas giant jupiter or saturn, essentialy a living thunderstorm
<br>
<br>
plus no one knows whats under titans cloudy coverage, recent estimates say that there could be large lakes of some sort of liquid,
<br>
not to mention europa, which could very well have an ocean under its frozen ice surface, and where theres an ocean , there very well could be hydrothermal vents
<br>
 <br>
 mars could still have liquid water under the surface, and mars is not verymuch different than earth in respect to size, length of the year etc
 <br>
 <br>
 mars was probally once inhabited by a human like species, but went extinct, for probally the same reasons we are going extinct
 <br>
 <br>
 Im sure however that the earth will survive after we are gone
 <br>

I found out where the face/pyramids,etc,area is on mars.I looked through some textbooks until I found it.If you have access to a map of mars-I found one from an old national geographic:
<br>
<br>
IT IS LOCATED IN THE "ELYSIUM" REGION[8D]
<br>
<br>
just thought you might want to know that,for anyone who has a map,and studies it w/the intention of projecting there.
<br>
<br>
I haven't gotten that far...YET.[

and when I get there,and come back,I'll paint some images of what I saw.

That link I posted above has the most recent pics I found, but the problem is, is that I heard of NASA blacking out alot of things they see.
<br>
In some of the pics of the men that went to mars you can see reflections of things in there helmets, and on one pic I saw they had infrared it, and it revealed a structure in the background that NASA had blacked out.
<br>
The moon Europa is one of Jupiters moons, under the frozen surface it is filled with water. In the center of it, they predict it is just like the bottom of our own ocean, and NASA is very positive that there is life within that moon.
<br>
In our own ocean we have found life living at the bottom where we thought it would be physically impossible for life to live there because of the pressure, so scientists assume that since Europa is a frozen ocean, that in the core there would be heat, thus making it extremely possible for life to develope within it.
<br>
<br>
Also did anyone hear of NASA accidently Nuking Jupiter? Well one of our satelites orbiting it accidently fell into the planet. It took a entire month for it to reach the surface, or inside it enough for it to explode, but because of it you can now see a black spot on the planet. There is also talk about how it almost ignited the planet, almost making a second Sun in our system, which would have inevitably killed us off.

I remember hearing about the 'nuking Jupiter' thing, but from what I heard they were trying to avoid a man-made object landing on a moon that had potential for life (maybe it was Io?), because any bacteria from Earth, etc., could possibly kill off anything on that moon.
<br>
<br>
The last time I was hearing about all of this, people were still arguing on whether or not it was even possible for such an object to ignite Jupiter as people claimed it could have. No doubt if it did ignite it would change surface life and most ocean life on Earth as we know it. I think there was a lot of debate as to whether or not that black spot was caused by the object as well. If I remember correctly, the spot appeared way off from where the machine was supposed to enter Jupiter's atmosphere.

probably has some more on those debates.

<section>
From what I remember hearing no one at first thought it was related to the satelite because it appeared a full month after the unit had fell into the atmosphere. But because of the atmosphere it took a full month for it to land or for it to go deep enough for it to explode, so I think its possible that it could have been at a diff area that the unit went into because of the time it took to fall.

ALL proven as not real. Â Every image is a misinterpretation. Â Think of Mars as the sand dunes of the sahari desert. Â They form images that mean nothing, and then the weather conditions take them away. Â *SIGH* Humanity and it's sudden obsession with Mars. Â To each his own I suppose.

The landscape just takes on random shapes which can look like shapes that represent something.
<br>
Didn't we all do something like that with clouds when we were young?
