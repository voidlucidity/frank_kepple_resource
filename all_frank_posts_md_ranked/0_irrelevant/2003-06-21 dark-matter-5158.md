<section>
0.4 percent of the UNIVERSE is luminous matter (stars, planets, and hot gas), and 3.6 percent are nonluminous components (which includes black holes and intergalactic gas).
<br>
Astronomers and Astrophysicist are PUZZLED and have no idea about the nature of the remaining 96 PERCENT, which they call dark matter and dark energy.
<br>
However, here in ASTRALPULSE it seems most of us don't have any qualms or doubts about the ASTRAL, and are willing to take any advice and go along and dive into the unknown, out of BLIND FAITH, that nothing BAD can happen so long you're on GOD's side.
<br>
This is a RELIGIOUS concept, and the use of scientific jargon here is only a ploy to hide this fact.
<br>
Be forewarned,
<br>
There are QUACKs in ASTRALPULSE that can lead you to doom if you let them.

Naturally, I do not wish to sound disrespectful of your obviously heart-felt opinions, Mirador, but I too couldn't help chuckling over the last last line of your post.
<br>
<br>
Plus, I'm not sure what you are going on about where you talk about diving into the unknown out of blind faith; and that nothing bad can happen so long as you are on God's side (whoever this God is... sorry, again, I mean no disrespect but I haven't got a religious bone in my body).
<br>
<br>
There are people here who regularly point out the various common pitfalls. And who do their utmost to teach people the various basic ground-rules that apply. None of this tends to involve religion of any kind. Quite the opposite, I'd say.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, I (for one) would argue that one of the core purposes of this BBS is to inform people the facts of the subject matter in hand: precisely to
<u>
 avoid
</u>
having people diving into the unknown out of blind faith.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, best of luck in your travels.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

i won't recap what everybody else just said.
<br>
<br>
"This is a RELIGIOUS concept, and the use of scientific jargon here is only a ploy to hide this fact."
<br>
<br>
scientists are trying to hide god from us?
<br>
<br>
"There are QUACKs in ASTRALPULSE that can lead you to doom if you let them."
<br>
<br>
doom? do you believe in hell, mirador? i'm sure you've heard that it was introduced between 350 and 600 ad. if you do believe in hell, do you have any ideas on why it was finally introduced so many years after jesus's death? and how can god send you for eternal punishment when he is infinitely forgiving? does he suddenly want nothing to do with you after you die? for he surely has power over 'satan'.

I was going to reply and then I saw that Mirador had edited his last several posts. That put a damper on my enthusiasm. However I would like to make an important point.
<br>
Organized religions are, at best, non-committal to the idea of Projections and out of body experiences. Many churches are straightforwardly against the practice of projection. I do not know of Any large religious institution that openly encourages, much less actively encourages, people to project out of body.
<br>
So the obvious conclusion is that religions do not support the practice of projecting. There is No conspiracy amoung Christian churches to get people to induce OBEs. In fact, it is quite the opposite.

Obviously they would begin to ask some very difficult questions to their religious leaders. [?][?][?] Also, fewer people would be going to church. [|)]
<br>
<br>
Uhmmmm, come to think of it... that is beginning to happen now.
