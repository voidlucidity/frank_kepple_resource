Hehe my teacher of filoshophy told us about this, what can we say ?prophets can really affect us so much (mabye only in subconciousness), to make people accept thatkind of things like taking into use this barcode, or was it just coincident.

I happened to come across this a while ago. Had about 3 minutes of chuckle-value as I recall.

Wow, that a materialistic perspective of the bible, im so shocked!*sarcasm*
<br>
<br>
What that passage reffers to is an ideal. The ideal of "the beast."
<br>
<br>
"In/on the hand" reffers to action. As in the person who has the mark of the beast, doesnt actually have any physical mark, but acts on the ideals of "the beast"
<br>
<br>
"in/on forehead" reffers to thought. One who has the mark on their forehead believes in "the beast" ideal.
<br>
<br>
YOu arent going around being branded or getting implants, it has to do with memes ("mind virii").
<br>
<br>
Now think about that and how it relates to todays materialistic society, the lack of spirituality of most people, and then decide whether there are "marks of the beast" already branded on some people.

Yes, like they say: Man is the only creature with the time and energy to pump all his sewage out to sea, and then go swimming in it.
