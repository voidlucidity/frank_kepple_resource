<br>
I'd like to start a thread on uplifting "jokes" funny stories and such here that we all could share. I will start with one.
<br>
<br>
***************************
<br>
There are philosophical sayings out there about laughter regarding God, and angels. Anybody know of any to share?
<br>
<br>
I have one I will start with, I remember clearly. It happened to me and I had a one panel cartoon drawn about it.
<br>
****************************************
<br>
A friend who happens to have an angel hovering invisibly near his shoulder walks up to another friend. Without realizing why he says to his friend,
<br>
[/b] "I'm an angel sent by God to give you three and a half messages, and the first three are irrelevant."
<b>
 <br>
 ******************************************
 <br>
 <br>
 When my friend told me this I couldn't stop laughing for a few minutes. I found it so absolutely hilarious at the time.
 <br>
 If you don't get it try again. Think about what it actually means. It's a total hoot. I'd rather not explain it. You have to get your own answers.
 <br>
 <br>
 Well, that's my joke/ true story.
 <br>
 **********************
 <br>
 <br>
 What are yours?

Archnea,
<br>
I was wondering about your invisibility experience. I saw you posted your experience on another thread.
<br>
I was wondering, do you know of any good books or Internet info on this topic? Invisibility.
<br>
Thanks.

It has been 16 years since I read anything about it and invisibility wasn't what I was studying at the time. I was reading books about the Celts and stumbled across things about invisibility. I wish I could remember the titles.

<section>
An article from a German newspaper:
<br>
<br>
"In retrospect, I admit it was unwise to try to gain access to my house via the catflap," Gunter Burpus admitted to reporters in Bremen, Germany.
<br>
<br>
"I suppose that's the reason they're called cat flaps, rather than human flaps, is because they're too small for people, and perhaps I should have realised that."
<br>
<br>
Burpus (41), a gardener from Bremen, was relating how he had become trapped in his own front door for two days, after losing his house keys.
<br>
<br>
"I got my head and shoulders through the flap but became trapped fast around the waist. At first, it all seemed rather amusing, I sang songs and told myself jokes. But then I wanted to go to the lavatory.
<br>
<br>
"I began shouting for help, but my head was in the hallway so my screams were muffled. After a few hours, a group of students approached me but, instead of helping, they removed my trousers and pants, painted my buttocks bright blue, and stuck a daffodil between my cheeks.
<br>
<br>
Then they placed a sign next to me which said 'Germany resurgent, an essay in street art. Please give generously' and left me there.
<br>
<br>
"People were passing by and, when I asked for help, they just said 'Very good! Very clever!' and threw coins into my trousers. No one tried to free me."
<br>
<br>
In fact, I only got free after two days because a dog started licking my private parts and an old woman complained to the police. The rescue services came and cut me out, but the police arrested me as soon as I was free. Luckily, they've now dropped the charges, and I collected over DM3,000 (US$2,000) in my underpants, so the time wasn't entirely wasted."

<section>
Three monks decided to practice meditation together. They sat by the side of a lake and closed their eyes in concentration. Then suddenly, the first one stood up and said, "I forgot my mat." He stepped miraculously onto the water in front of him and walked across the lake to their hut on the other side.
<br>
<br>
When he returned, the second monk stood up and said, "I forgot to put my other underwear to dry." He too walked calmly across the water and returned the same way.
<br>
<br>
The third monk watched the first two carefully in what he decided must be the test of his own abilities. "Is your learning so superior to mine? I too can match any feat you two can perform," he declared loudly and rushed to the water's edge to walk across it. He promptly fell into the deep water.
<br>
<br>
Undeterred, the yogi climbed out of the water and tried again, only to sink into the water. Yet again he climbed out and yet again he tried, each time sinking into the water. This went on for some time as the other two monks watched.
<br>
<br>
After a while, the second monk turned to the first and said, "Do you think we should tell him where the stones are?"
<br>
<br>
------------------------------
<br>
<br>
Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks. By nightfall on the first day,the candle began to flicker and then went out. The first monk said, "Oh, no! The candle is out."
<br>
<br>
The second monk said, "Aren't we not supposed to talk?"
<br>
<br>
The third monk said, "Why must you two break the silence?"
<br>
<br>
The fourth monk laughed and said, "Ha! I'm the only one who didn't speak."

A middle-aged woman had a heart attack and is rushed to hospital. On the operating table she had a near-death experience, saw God and asks him nervously, "So this is it?" God laughed and said, "Heavens no my child, you have another 30 to 40 years of life left to live!" Hearing this she decides to stay in hospital having a face-lift, liposuction, breast augmentation, a tummy tuck, and even had someone come in and change her hair: figuring that since she had another 30 or 40 years she may as well make the most of it. Anyhow, she had her last operation, left the hospital, and crossing the road outside is run over and killed by an ambulance speeding to that very same hospital. She arrives in front of God and asks angrily, "I thought you said I had another 30 to 40 years?" God replies, "Err, sorry I didn't recognise you."

Understanding Engineers - Take One
<br>
Two engineering students crossing the campus when one said, "Where did
<br>
you get such a great bike?"
<br>
The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday
<br>
minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike.
<br>
She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said,
<br>
"Take what you want."
<br>
The first engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes
<br>
probably wouldn't have fit."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Two
<br>
To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Three
<br>
A pastor, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a
<br>
particularly slow group of golfers.
<br>
The engineer fumed, "What's with these guys? We must have been waiting
<br>
for 15 minutes!"
<br>
The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude!"
<br>
The pastor said, "Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word
<br>
with him."
<br>
"Hi George! Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather
<br>
slow, aren't they?"
<br>
The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind
<br>
fire-fighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire
<br>
last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."
<br>
The group was silent for a moment.
<br>
The pastor said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer
<br>
for them tonight."
<br>
The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my
<br>
ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."
<br>
The engineer said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Four
<br>
What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers?
<br>
Mechanical Engineers build weapons and Civil Engineers build targets.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Five
<br>
The graduate with a Science degree asks, "Why does it work?"
<br>
The graduate with an Engineering degree asks, "How does it work?"
<br>
The graduate with an Accounting degree asks, "How much will it cost?"
<br>
The graduate with a Liberal Arts degree asks, "Do you want fries with that?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Six
<br>
Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the
<br>
possible designers of the human body.
<br>
One said, "It was a mechanical engineer." Just look at all the joints."
<br>
Another said, "No, it was an electrical engineer. The nervous system
<br>
has many thousands of electrical connections."
<br>
The last one said, "Actually it was a civil engineer. Who else would
<br>
run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?"
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Seven
<br>
"Normal people believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
<br>
Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet"
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Eight
<br>
An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was
<br>
better to spend time with the wife or a mistress.
<br>
The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid
<br>
foundation for an enduring relationship.
<br>
The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because the passion
<br>
and mystery he found there.
<br>
The engineer said, "I like both."
<br>
"Both?"
<br>
"Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you
<br>
are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and
<br>
get some work done."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Understanding Engineers - Take Nine
<br>
An engineer was crossing a road one-day when a frog called out to him
<br>
and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."
<br>
He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket.
<br>
The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back
<br>
into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."
<br>
The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and
<br>
returned it to the pocket.
<br>
The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a
<br>
princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want."
<br>
Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back
<br>
into his pocket.
<br>
Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a
<br>
beautiful princess, and that I'll stay with you for a week and do
<br>
anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"
<br>
The engineer said, "Look, I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a
<br>
girlfriend, but a talking frog, now that's cool."

Reappeared by courtesy of Amir.  Deep gratitude to you.
<br>
<br>
XXIX (SECOND PART)
<br>
<br>
Silent friend of many distances, feel
<br>
how your breath enlarges space.  From the dark
<br>
Rafters of the belfry let the peal
<br>
Of yourself ring out, each bat becomes a lark,
<br>
Singing its exuberance to the harrier.
<br>
Be easeful as your morph from shape to shape.
<br>
What changed you from a shadow to a warrior?
<br>
If the grain tastes bitter, make yourself the grape.
<br>
In this tumultuous night flicker as the flame
<br>
Of magic at the crossroads where every sense
<br>
Meets every other.  Live their confluence.
<br>
Don't worry if the night forgets your name.
<br>
Affirm to the quiet earth:  I flow.
<br>
Play to the crowded water, pianissimo.
<br>
<br>
You may read German better than I, so here it is in the original,
<br>
<br>
XXIX (ZWEITER TEIL)
<br>
<br>
Stiller Freund der vielen Fernen, fühle
<br>
wie dein Atem noch den Raum vermehrt.
<br>
Im Gebalk der finstern Glockenstühle
<br>
laß dich läuten. Das, was an dir zehrt,
<br>
<br>
wird ein Starkes über dieser Nahrung.
<br>
Geh in der Verwandlung aus und ein.
<br>
Was ist deine leidenste Erfahrung?
<br>
Ist dir Trinken bitter, werde Wein.
<br>
<br>
Sei in dieser Nacht aus Übermaß
<br>
Zauberkraft am Kreuzweg deiner Sinne,
<br>
ihrer seltsamen Begegnung Sinn.
<br>
<br>
Und wenn dich das Irdische vergaß,
<br>
zu der stillen Erde sag: Ich rinne.
<br>
Zu dem raschen Wasser sprich: Ich bin
<br>
<br>
Rainer Maria Rilke

The majority of those healed in Lourdes, France are not praying for themselves but, for others.

This seems to be moving away from jokes... how are German poems and people praying for others getting healed funny?

mea culpa.
<br>
<br>
Thought our posts fit neatly under "uplifting"   "and AND SUCH covers a vast plane.
<br>
<br>
I read this as "UPLIFTING jokes funny STORIES AND SUCH" (caps obviously mine)   I personally appreciated AuraMassageArt's Lourdes story.
<br>
<br>
Won't  happen again.

You really have to go back and read it from the beginning for it to qualify under this topic . . . I

it fits!

Reminds me of a friendship a year ago.

This friendship has been renewed.

Thought this was funny and yet brilliantly helpful -- that translates to "uplifting" in my world, altho others may see it differently:

 Nasreddin Hodsha and the cherry tree
</b>
<br>
<br>
One day Nasreddin sat under a cherry tree, dozing a little bit. Right in front of him there was a field of watermelons. Absorbed in regarding the watermelons, Nasreddin began to wonder. He said to himself: "How strange that such big fruit as watermelons grow on such tender bushes and tiny fruit like the cherries above me on such a big tree. There is surely something wrong with it. Perhaps the creator has made a mistake?"
<br>
Immediately a cherry fell from the tree straight onto Nasreddin's head, and he hailed: "Praise Allah, the Almighty, the Omniscient."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
@chimerae: This is a beautiful poem of Rilke you posted. German language used at its best. thanks

Nice one Yothu - I like that a lot.
<br>
<br>
When I was younger and a "born-again" Christian, I was told this story.  Whether it's true or not is irrelevant - it's uplifting and makes you smile.
<br>
<br>
In a religious/scientific exam at college, students were asked to "explain" in their own terms how Jesus turned water into wine.  Many students wrote pages and pages of equations and so on to interpret how it was done.
<br>
<br>
There was a particular student who simply wrote one sentence - and passed with top marks.  The sentence was:
<br>
<br>
"
<i>
 The humble water looked at Jesus and blushed
</i>
."
<br>
<br>
Lovely, isn't it?
<br>
<br>

 I'd like to start a thread on uplifting "jokes" funny stories and such here that we all could share. I will start with one.
 <br>
 <br>
 ***************************
 <br>
 There are philosophical sayings out there about laughter regarding God, and angels. Anybody know of any to share?
 <br>
 <br>
 I have one I will start with, I remember clearly. It happened to me and I had a one panel cartoon drawn about it.
 <br>
 ****************************************
 <br>
 A friend who happens to have an angel hovering invisibly near his shoulder walks up to another friend. Without realizing why he says to his friend,
 <br>
 [/b] "I'm an angel sent by God to give you three and a half messages, and the first three are irrelevant."
 <b>
  <br>
  ******************************************
  <br>
  <br>
  When my friend told me this I couldn't stop laughing for a few minutes. I found it so absolutely hilarious at the time.
  <br>
  If you don't get it try again. Think about what it actually means. It's a total hoot. I'd rather not explain it. You have to get your own answers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Well, that's my joke/ true story.
  <br>
  **********************
  <br>
  <br>
  What are yours?

I am not english. Can you explain the joke? Dont take this personally, but its indeed my fault: i just understand the basics of english, not the subtle things.

Thought I'd share this meditation adaptation from the paphlets Colorado publishes on bear encounters.
<br>
<br>
The author noticed the wisdom and just substituted "thought" for "bear"
<br>
<br>
" Meditation Hints from the Colorado Division of Wildlife"
<br>
by Kim Boykin
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are no definite rules about what to do if
<br>
you meet a thought. Thought attacks are rare
<br>
compared to the number of close encounters.
<br>
However, if you do meet a thought before it has
<br>
time to leave the area, here are some suggestions:
<br>
<br>
REMEMBER:
<br>
Every situation is different with respect to the thought,
<br>
the terrain, the people, and their activity.
<br>
<br>
STAY CALM:
<br>
If you see a thought and it hasn't seen you,
<br>
calmly leave the area.
<br>
<br>
STOP:
<br>
Back away slowly while facing the thought.
<br>
Give the thought plenty of room to escape.
<br>
Wild thoughts rarely attack people unless
<br>
they feel threatened or provoked.
<br>
<br>
SPEAK SOFTLY:
<br>
This may reassure the thought that no harm is meant it.
<br>
<br>
IF A THOUGHT STANDS UPRIGHT
<br>
OR MOVES CLOSER:
<br>
It may be trying to detect smells in the air.
<br>
This isn't a sign of aggression. Once a thought
<br>
identifies you, it may leave the area
<br>
or it may try to intimidate you by charging
<br>
within a few feet before it withdraws.
<br>
<br>
DON'T RUN OR MAKE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS:
<br>
Running is likely to prompt the thought to give chase and
<br>
... you can't outrun a thought!
