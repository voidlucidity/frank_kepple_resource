Has anyone hear of the Hyper dimensional Resonator?.  Supposedly it is supposed to induce instant obe's to certain periods of time.  You set the dial to a date and time, you wear the device for a few minutes, you sit and relax and the next thing you know your observing the time period you set.  If used on the right setting on a natural grid point it is supposed to send you to that time period physically.  People have said it only lasts 6 hours but i am unsure if it replaces your astral body from that time period with your present, or if you actually transport and dissapear.  The whole idea seems far fetched and the machine costs $360 dollars, either way even if it doesnt send you through time which it is speicifically designed for from the design of it it should still aid in spiritual development.  Does anyone know about this or have any experience with it?, it seems really interesting.
<br>
This is the homepage for the device where you can read about it and purchase it...

Well, I hate to pour cold water on someone's fire but I would say, no, it doesn't work. Though being an ex-electronics design engineer the schematics of the various devices did give me a hearty chuckle.

HI there ausstray85,
<br>
I had conversed at length with a man who claimed to have used these types of "machines" to travel through time. He was offering time travel lessons on line about two years ago. He admitted that the use of these machines had left him with a mental imbalance, yet he still proposed using them in his supposed lessons (the lessons never came about).
<br>
The Montauk Experiment used similar machines as well, and were not very well controlled.
<br>
However I can offer you a safer method to try. As I have learned from "The Tibitan",  Djwhal Khul, there are three  places in the human forehead to send/receive other time/place knowledge (these include the "third eye")  The one which one uses to explore future time is at the right upper portion of the forehead.
<br>
The first time I achieved entrance to this portal it was quite painful physically, but well worth it. Simply using meditation and focused  intent I was able to access this.
<br>
I have heard Frank mention using different portions of the brain for such functions as well. (Frank, if you read this I would like more detail and results of your own explorations.)
<br>

<section>
All your doing is sending electromagnetic waves through your brain, with the coil output. It has been reported to induce out of body sensations in some experiments done.  Who knows what damage you may be doing to your brain though? The time dial is probably just something to give you the suggestion that you are traveling in time (hypnosis).
<br>
<br>
for a safe way to achieve OBE'S I suggest the $49 (4 cd set) available on this page

Nope, I haven't used it but I would bet pounds against pennies that it does not work as described. Plus, my first degree was in electronics so the descriptions that don't "add up" electronic's wise, are
<u>
 immediately
</u>
apparent to me.
<br>
<br>
But, hey, if you have money to burn then
<u>
 please
</u>
don't let my humble opinion stop you. You go ahead and start "travelling through time" and do be sure to let us all know how you get on. Like I say, I'll give this Golden Opportunity a miss. Because with me I reckon the only time I'd end-up wanting to go back to, was the point immediately prior to putting a cheque for $360 in the mail.

hey frank,
<br>
i understand that u are thinking technically but i havent seen any message regarding the failure of functioning of HDR. as a matter of fact, atleast 10% of the people browsing thro these web pages can afford to bet $360. so, i think someone must have tried by now and if it was a failure, why wudn that person say against steve openly. but, if it was a success, its quite possible that person doesn want to tell anyone. wat do u say?

<section>
Because that person feel uncorfortable confessing to being had?
<br>
<br>
I looked at the site and especially the 'schematic'. It says nothing whatsoever about the way the thing is supposed to work.
<br>
What's radionics? How exactly will kilowatt range energy create tachyons, and when have they exactly been proven to exist beyond theory?
<br>
<br>
While the idea of creating a tachyon field sounds credible the fact that the device shold work would certainly mean this guy wouldn't have to ask you for $360. He'd be pulling in the money like there's no tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
Now, a psychosomatic or palcebo effect caused by this device is plausible and can indeed be behind some success in using it. But imo, household outlets will not create a tachyon field. Without a more specific schematic I''d be wary of touching the thing lest it really induce an OBE. Permanently.
<br>
<br>
On another line, I just read an article about indicing OBE-like experiences by stimulating certain parts of the brain with a strong magnetic field. I'll try to see if I can dig up the reference.
<br>
<br>
YMMV, of course and my opinions don't invalidate yours.

If it's too good to be true, it usually is.
<br>
<br>
The sites are designed by someone who has no knowledge of e-commerce, html (or web-programming languages), or even a grasp of what true professionalism is.
<br>
<br>
Something that looks like it was designed by a 5-year old with a paintroller can't be expected to be taken seriously.
<br>
<br>
Most of the devices on there tell us that all the aspirations of science-fiction have already been met. The declaration is that we have already become masters of the universe, thus defeating the hundreds of millions of dollars put into scientic research funds by governments each year.
<br>
<br>
The creators of these devices are aiming a product at one specific audience: the open-minded naivete who isn't afraid to buy into his (or her) curiosity.
<br>
<br>
There is also the old saying, that hard work and patience yield results over a cheap shortcut.

Tangri: I understand where you are coming from, and you pose an interesting question. However, for my part, it is impossible for me to make any assessment of a person's motivations and/or experiences with a product I have never used, and a person I have never known.
<br>
<br>
Surely it must beg the question that if a person truly has invented a device which can transport them through time, then why does he have to sell it for however-many USD?
<br>
<br>
And other questions spring to mind too. Like, we all know Physical devices have a finite lifespan. What would happen, therefore, if you transported to a time long-after your machine broke down? Or a time before your machine was invented? Also, what is there to stop a person buying the machine, then travelling back to cancel the cheque?
<br>
<br>
<u>
 Note: I am not knocking the idea, merely the products and the descriptions applied to them.
</u>
<br>
<br>
It is perfectly possible to "travel" between what are commonly called: parallel universes. A seasoned projector can do this (though not in the Physical sense) by travelling along the myriad of tubular structures that link all the various different realms of Physical-reality universes. I posted on this very topic on another forum just recently.
<br>
<br>
As regards the technology, aspect, I am reliably informed the type of craft and propulsion-system necessary in order to travel between universes, in a more Physical sense, is of a biological origin. The highly-advanced nature of which, in no way can be compared to the paltry devices listed on the website in question.
<br>
<br>
But again, there's nothing stopping either you or anyone giving it a go. Naturally, I'm sure there will be a number of people mighty interested in knowing how you get on (myself included).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

hi everyone,
<br>
i have talked to steven gibbs personally twice. yesterday and a couple of days back. i talked him at length and asked him a couple of questions. he very strongly claims about the successful working of his device and also relates his device with The Lord and paranormal forces. if anyone of u wants to talk to him, u can find his numbers on the new website he gave me:

. i am software consultant here in MI, USA and as a matter of fact i dont have in depth knowledge of physics coz never studied after grade 12. and i think i dont really have a need to travel through time but just out of curosity i m going to buy HDR. and believe me, i will definitely tell u my experiences in either case. i wont feel bad for losing the money or i wont feel ashamed. i m just paying for my curosity, for an experiment. i still ask u guys to talk to him as i did and try to get something out of him if u could. please come out with any suggestions u have regarding the usage of device

It is good to have doubt with this machine. But I am very very sure that
<br>
"AS FAR AS THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS ARE CONCERNED, YES YOU CAN USE THE HYPER-DIMENSIONAL RESONATOR FOR PHYSICAL TIME TRAVEL, BUT ONLY WHEN ACTIVATED OVER A NATURAL GRID POINT, OR IN A PLACE WHERE UFO'S ARE SIGHTED"
<br>
is
<b>
 untrue
</b>
. This is against the Universal Law. The CREATOR designed this universe for an important purpose. To experience spirituality through physical world. Time travel physically into the past or future will cause unseen disturbance into other people life physically.The universe will be a big mess.
<br>
However, people can time travel into the past astrally. They are just acessing the Ak???(I cant remember the name) record of the earth. The virtual reality archive record of the earth history. Human astral body being the integral part of the universe can access this information by training.

Stephen: Yep, I couldn't agree more. But it's a funny old world. I think perhaps a lot of the time with these kinds of schemes it boils down to sheer curiosity. The promotor I reckon probably has a screw loose somewhere. Though I say that with respect because it takes all kinds to make a world.
<br>
<br>
Did you read the bit about him having two websites on unconnected servers? Reason being, the "aliens" are trying to shut him down. So if they manage to shut-down one website he can use the other. I mean, if these so-called aliens could shut-down one website then they must surely be able to do it a second time.

It's all relative I guess, there are many people who would think we are crazy for claiming we leave our bodies even though most of us are pretty down to earth about it (from what I've seen).

as exciting as Micheal J Fox's thing lol, but on the site was also pretty dubious stuff like how to defy gravity for just $15 or something and strange devices that looked like they'd been constructed from components from the Maplin's catalogue, cheap toggle switches and those plastic boxes they sell.

Yes indeed! Are you interested in wireless?

I did my Class A radio license about 27 years ago - I still remember the morse code test - it was more nerve wracking than a driving test I reckon! Having learned morse on a modern morse key, the examiner, who was an imposing maritime type character located at an East coast of England shipping station, produced this huge clunky morse key that looked as if it had been borrowed from the maritime museum! Fortunately I was able to adapt quite quickly and pass [

Adrian: Yes, I originally took my MPT radio officer's certificate at Fleetwood Nautical College. Morse-code I *still* remember (mostly). Okay, I cannot now TX/RX at 20 wpm but given a week or two I reckon I might.

My intention, originally, was to become a radio officer in the merchant navy. But upon finishing college I had the chance to spend a further year at Lancaster University to gain a full degree in Electronics. So after some deliberation I chose the latter.

I believe in the Fifth Dimension theory where there is no Paradoxes
<br>
so if you were to go back in time and intervened e.g. stopped Princess Diana from getting into that car on that fateful August night in Paris than Diana
<i>
 would
</i>
be alive on Sep 1, 1997 instead of being a corpse. She would be alive
<b>
 but
</b>
in an
<i>
 alternate
</i>
new universe different than the one you came from! So in universe #1 the universe you time traveled from, Princess Diana is still known as the late Princess of Wales but in the newly created Parallel Universe #2 Diana is still very much alive and completely unaware that in another universe she has "died". So is it possible for you the time traveler to go back to the precise point where you left off in universe #1? Probably not but if the alternate universe you time travel forward to is almost exactly like your
<i>
 original
</i>
<br>
universe(Universe #1)than you wouldn't have much of a problem adjusting and no one would ever notice what had happened. The question would be is if Princess Diana is dead or alive in the new universe you time travel forward to? What would be the point of time traveling to prevent her death if you couldn't actually see the result or should I say the complete unawareness of her death in the first place? Could someone time travel and guarantee their getting back to the "right" universe? So Frank, tangri might be able to time travel in the future but that doesn't necessarily mean he would come back to
<i>
 this
 <i>
  universe as you know it! Just my two cents [

Your 'hypothesis' seems suggested that there is someone who is EXACTLY like you and EXACTLY conscious and doing the EXACTLY the same things. Some sort of duplication of th VERY SELF in a parallel Universe.What is the SPIRITUAL Purpose of that?! Remember to ask yourself the spiritual purpose the creator designed of this if you think it exists. For me, I see it a direct violation to our very own nature of existence and the purpose of the universes. However, there are parallel universes but not the kind you described!

<section>
When I say fifth dimension I mean the universe is capable of more than just four dimensions maybe even one hundred or more even! Some believe that if you traveled back in time it would create a paradox and upset the balance of time. Some think even if you were to go back in time you couldn't and wouldn't be able to intervene with history. Anything you tried to do would backfire, misfire etc. I don't believe this. I believe there are other alternative parallel worlds with an infinite number of possibilities being played out. Yes I think there are other me's in other universes. My example earlier of preventing Princess Diana's death is like this..if you traveled back in time you would be entering a mirror image of our universe, a reverse time. You would be in an alternative universe and if you prevented Diana
<br>
s death you would be free to do so without upsetting the balance of time because you would save Diana who inhabits an alternative universe. That's why there is no paradox! The princess who does die is in a completely different universe than the one in which she is prevented from getting into that car and thus living instead of dying.
<br>
If you went back into time physically you couldn't go back into that stream of time where your physical body is because you couldn't inhabit the same space! You would be "pushed" into another dimension if you tried, thus an alternative universe that is like ours but is different. So you would be preventing the death of an "alternative" Princess Diana NOT the one from which you time traveled from, she would still be dead. Understand? Even if you tried to get back to your home universe I don't think you could, you would be masked from ever re-entering any universe you ever came from. Than of course you would think you would be doing that alternative universe a favor by preventing their Princesses death but what if her future child(if she would have gotten pregnant) grew up to be a terror? Grew up and killed many people? What if by saving Diana's life in that universe you helped kill future lives? It could go on and on. I'm tired so I'm not going to write anymore but your comments are welcome.

I forgot to add that my example of time travel would be if you traveled at the speed of light. If you traveled just under the speed of light you would get to a certain destination in the universe in about two years

 But

if you could somehow get back to your home universe or a universe close to it, over 4 million years would have passed!

Yep and remember the tv show Sliders? The kid and his friends found a way to time travel but everytime they thought they had come back to their home universe, their "home" was either slightly or alot different. They kept coming back to other parallel universes never being able to really go home to the universe in which they traveled FROM.

The idea of time travel physically is more dangerous than exploding atomic bomb in your hands. It hinders your spiritual understanding of the universe.
<br>
First ask yourself what is the purpose of the universes. Why you are here physically in this universe.
<br>
Physical time travel violates the evolution of consciousness and intellect. Knowledge , ideas and inventions have to be imagined before it becomes what it is. Travelling into the future and 'steal' an idea which is not imagined at the present universe also means that all the ideas and all the inventions have been imagined. There is no point of imagining and improving the design of something. This also means that at the beginning of evolution of CREATOR consciousness, the CREATOR can travel into the future and still its own idea of creating a better universe??
<br>
Preventing the death of 'Princess Diana" in alternative universe? That's mean, to begin with there exist at least two universes which it exactly the duplication of self. You either follow what she does or she follows what you do. Where is the FREE WILL of a person? What is the point of having such duplication?
<br>
What is the purpose the CREATOR creates infinite parallel worlds with an infinite number parallel words with an infinite number of possibilities being played out?
<br>
The Creator being the most intelligent and most consciously evolved being of all universes is not an idiot.

Science fiction will be FICTION. The truth is always the TRUTH. No matter how many people BELIEVE otherwise. No matter how many people believe that the river flows from the sea to the mountain, no one can change the TRUTH that the river will always flows from the mountain to the sea.
<br>
In science  (since I am a physicist myself), ridiculous things have been hypothesized which directly violates the purpose of the universes.
<br>
<br>
Jesus said, " If your leaders say to you, "Look, the kingdom is in heaven," then the birds of heavens will precede you. If they say to you, "It is in the sea," the fish will precede you. Rather, the Kingdom is inside you and it is outside you.

Bom, we will have agree to disagree although I respect your opinion.
<br>
I'm not saying you to believe what I believe or think, to each his/her own. I believe in a higher power and if it is his wish for alternate universes than it's not up to us to question it! I say why not other universes like ours? Time is linear to us but I believe the time, present and future all exist at once. We only are concious of what happens in the here and now but those who can see into the future somehow tap into another stream of time. If a psychic tells me what is going to happen in my future, they are simply telling me
<i>
 one
</i>
possible path of the future. I could leave the psychic's office and cross the street thereby completely changing that possible future. We are of free will and we have many possible future's so nothing is set in stone. That is just my opinion. [

Travel through time in the physical does sound to me like it should be possible. How it would work without violating natural laws is another matter. Neither is an actual concern at the moment. If it does become possible then the hows and whys would suddenly matter. As for the "hyper dimensional resonator" ... it makes for a good laugh.

You are turning this into a religious thread and that is not what this is. This is about time travel. If I choose to question God or not is not your concern. I appreciate your advice though. I think the resonator to me anyway doesn't look like it would do anything for anyone and probably a scam. Maybe not but I don't have the money to order nor would I order it even if I could without reading more about it. Did Tangi ever actually recieve it or has anyone actually tried it?

I HAVE BOUGHT THE MACHINE and don't care for time travel at all. But for the use of astral projection. The machine looks great and so far every way it has been explained is the way it works. I plan to try it for astral projection in about 2 weeks (more or less) and will let you know what happens. I have talked to steven a number of times and listen to him on art bell radio show. I have studied over the complete time travel guide (all the reports he sells) and they are accurate with meta physical, and occult knowledge. Which is nothing but spiritual information that was lost but is making its way back around and has to be called occult or esoteric because the main public doesn't understand it yet. We got to remember the main public doens't understand astral projection and there are so many things that we don't know about the universe. So may be we don't understand this machine. For Frank, I'm not going to insult your intelligence but if you have astral projected conciously before you should know the limits of the physical rational brain. That all the stuff we learn in universities, etc are not even .0000001% of what is really going on in the universe. In due time I will tell you what happens. But then it will be just my experience and I don't wont anyone to believe me, just check it out for yourself.

To whom ever. There once was a saying that millionares never astral project or speak to psychics, BILLIONAIRES DO. This is a funny article to go with that quote. Not to be taken serious because I don't know the facts behind it.

Yep, and that is just the universe we know. And when we AP, I've always made clear that one of the biggest hurdles we have to overcome is the sense of conscious awareness we take with us to the Astral is the same as we have while Physical. So in that we 100% agree. The area in which I think we may differ is the Time-Travel machine. But I (for one) will look forward to your report in 2 weeks time.

You fail to realize that the machine operates on electromagnetic current. Scientific study has indicated that a part of the brain is capable of inducing artificial OoBE or AP experiences.

To suggest that this method is authentic is to suggest that hallucination experiences (i.e. through the use of narcotics that affect parts of the brain) are authentic AP / OoBE experiences as well.

 <br>
 <br>
 It's not that the public understands. Rather, these . . . philosophies, as I will call them . . . are branded as esoteric because they have not fallen into mainstream popularity yet.
 <br>
 Note: While an element of New Age, Astral Projection philosophy is actually a culture outside of it. There is nothing religious about it, nor anything New Age about it either. New Age is a horrid, reckless term used to describe too many things that have minimal relevance with each other.
 <br>
 <br>
 New Age has always been there. It has simply gained momentum because the Media is recognizing that everyone has the ability to think for themselves. Since I cannot think of anyone rationally abiding to a religious system (and its dogmatic principles) in complete, literal context, I can safely conjecture that New Age is something every person shares in common in one way or another.
 <br>
 <br>
 New Age is simply a mislabeled alternative to Religion. As long as a person questions, they will fall into this catagory.

I'm not trying to physically time travel, its possible to do that though(not talking about using this machine) Time travel is risky business unless your an elighten being (again common terminology) I will test it for astral projection, remember this is a astral projection forum. But yes this guy has a big sense of humor. He knows what he is talking about but at the same time he can make you laugh with some of the things he says. He's not a jokester (meaning trying to get over on you), some people just have humoriest personalities. I bet your refering to the time cops interview. That was funny. Well wish me luck.

Here's an encyclopaedia reference regarding Tachyons:
<br>
<blockquote id='"quote"'>

  <br>
  tachyon
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  (tk´n´´) (KEY) , hypothetical elementary particle that travels only at speeds exceeding that of light. According to the theory of relativity, the speed of light is the limiting velocity for all ordinary material particles. Particles having nonzero rest mass can approach, but not reach, the speed of light, since their mass would become infinite at that speed. On the other hand, particles with zero rest mass, such as the photon and the neutrino, must always travel at the speed of light; they cannot be brought to rest or even slowed down. Theorists have argued that since nothing in principle prohibits the existence of a third class of particles that travel only at speeds exceeding that of light, such particles, called tachyons [Gr. tachys,=swift] may exist although no evidence for them has been found. In the terminology of the theory, the particles that travel only at the speed of light are called luxons, and those that travel at lesser speeds are called tardyons. Like the original theory of relativity, the theory of tachyons has several aspects that appear to contradict common sense but that are fully self-consistent. For example, a tachyon must have an imaginary (in the mathematical sense) rest mass, or proper mass, and it must travel faster rather than slow down when it loses energy.

<br>
<br>
But then it seems the hyperdimentional resinator actually uses "Tecyon energy" not Tachyons, so it could be something completely different.
<br>
Unfortunately the poor little tachyon is currently being used to death by many alternative health companies as the latest cure for everything. It also seems that "radionics", apart from being a trademarked brand name for Tyco medial equipment, is another over used miracle science/new-age cure-all based around EMF type diagnostics.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Has anybody read Michael Criton's book Timeline?
<br>
<br>
It goes into a great deal of time travel possibilities. It also goes into details of quantum physics relating to the multiverse theories. He's really a very clever writer to be able to take hold of so much scientific theory and twist it just enough to make it fiction while still having it seem plausible. The thing about Michael Criton's fiction though is that he makes it into a story and sells the story. He doesn't make it into a device then try to sell the device.
<br>
<br>
I have seen some astounding examples of "malleable" laws of physics in the descriptions of things being sold over the internet. Recently on this site ther was a discussion about an asian doctor claiming to have magnetic rings that could extend the human lifespan to near imortality. The thing was I didn't see any testimonies from 300 year old people. Funny that! I've also seen descriptions of a device that some doctor - physicist in the US has that uses supposed Tesla based research to cure people of cancer and Hep C. He couldn't even get the technical terminology correct.
<br>
<br>
It seems that whenever somebody wants something bad enough, there's someone on the internet willing to sell it. But then, I read it on the internet so it MUST be true.
<br>
<br>
I'm afraid bad science is one of my pet peeves.
<br>
<br>
As for the Hyperdimentional Resonator (is that anything like Marvin the Martian's Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?), the double terminated quartz crystals advertised on the same page would be a better buy, and probably more functional.

] I don't agree with that definition but then we have to realize that it is made by a lack of understanding of what holds this universe together. Like the old gravity is slower then sound, now gravity is faster then the speed of light. We don't know what tachyon energy is more so then we know what gravity is. Science is constantly updating their theories. I jsut hope this damn machine works. And yes the crystal is good if you know how to use it!

<section>
Gravity is a consequence of the bending of space-time caused by the presence of matter-energy. The more matter-energy that is present in an area of space-time, the more the space-time will be warped. This is why the path of light is bent noticeably by large gravity wells. It is just taking the shortest path, a straight line through curved space-time. It does not take time for gravity to act on something in its area of influence any more than a physical object takes time to exist in its current shape.
<br>
<br>
"Tachyon energy" could very easily just be energy like we use with NEW. I would not rule out the possibility of raising energy without the presence of consciousness. If it can be proven I will be happy to see it proven. What really bugs me is the abuse of technical terms.

Well we are falling off the topic of the HDR machine. I will try it again monday, (run more test on it) Check for elf radiation, north pole polarity, Golden ratio, etc. then try it for astral projection later next week.

Pseudoscience has gained momentum for whatever reason or another. As I see it, the methodical practice of taking technical jargon and warping it around nonsensical methods is all too obvious for me (or perhaps a paraphrased placebo).
<br>
<br>
If I am not mistaken, the existence of the blackeon and the tacheyon are contravertial because the particles themselves have not been isolated and contained. Since they are theoretical, I can concur with the fact they have yet to be discovered.
<br>
<br>
So where, then, does pseudoscience get away with taking credit for miraculous discoverings based upon fundamental science that has yet to be discovered?

Well put Leviiathan!
<br>
This is EXACTLY the thing that ticks me off about many alternative therapy organisations.
<br>
<br>
If you plug "Tachyons" into a search engine you'll get dozens of alternative medicine sites wanting to sell you some kind of treatment based on the use of tachyon energy, and only a couple of sites that have genuine information on this

How are they taking credit for something that hasn't been discovered yet?  That doesn't make any sense to me.  Thats like saying you're taking credit for inventing something that just hasn't been invented yet.
<br>
<br>
The meaning of pseudoscience is anything that isn't recognized by the scientific community as a whole.  So if they were to discover something that hasn't been discovered yet they would be considered a pseudoscience because of the fact it isn't discovered by science yet.  Should they wait till its discovered by fundamental science so they're not taking the credit.  And if it just hasn't been discovered yet then they're not really pseudo science in the way you mean it.  "yet" implies fundamental science will catch up.
<br>
<br>
That statement was confusing to me.
<br>
<br>
Its like saying what right do people have talking about OBE's and claiming knowlege of obe's when really they're just taking credit for something science hasn't discovered yet.  If they haven't discovered it yet.. then how is credit being taken away?
<br>
<br>
You also keep talking about pseudo science.  Anything but the hard facts of science are actually defined as "pseudoscience" that definitely would include OBE's and the study of this type of energy.
<br>
<br>
I think the device is silly... but a person has to learn for themselves. I mean if they'll buy a time travel device cus the guy seems honest enough.  excrement in real life who knows what they'd buy.  I figure they have to learn.
<br>
<br>
But I dont think using unproven particles to argue the point is really the way to do it.  The way it effects your physical brain and the fact its not doing anything but sending waves is actually the best argument I saw.  The thing claims to be technical.. so i could see arguing it technically doesn't do anything.

<section>
The way I interpret Leviiathan's comment, it makes perfect sense.
<br>
<br>
Pseudoscience is actually an example given in an online dictionary for the meaning of the word pseudo as being a deception or a sham.
<br>
<br>
If the makers of alternative treatment products wish to use the term "Tachyon Energy" to describe a function of their product, then they are taking on all meaning inherent in that word. In this case "tachyons" are clearly described in dictionaries and encyclopaedias as being a
<i>
 hypothetical
</i>
faster than light particle. They have not yet been proven, only theorised.
<br>
<br>
Unlike OBEs, where nobody is claiming to be utilising any proven scientific theories or known laws of physics, the makers of the HDR and other such "superluminal technology" devices are fully implying that not only have tachyons been proven to exist, they are able to be used to heal people of illnesses.
<br>
<br>
But as mentioned before, the promoters of the HDR are apparently using
<i>
 tecyon
</i>
energy not tachyons, and I admit to having no idea what a tecyon really is.

Our understanding of the universe whether it is about Tachyons or gravity or time-travel is limited by our knowledge and our current ability to test theory experimentally.Even if something is mathematical logical doesn't mean that it will exist!!(from my view as an physicist).
<br>
The bending of light by gravity is based on curvature of space-time. The bending of light by a lens is due to change of permittivity and permeability of the medium (electromagnetic in nature). I wonder, the so called vacuum permittivity and permeability constants are modified in the presence of gravity? It will still give the same result as the model of space-time curvature. Space-time curvature doesn't able to explain the Biefield -Brown Effect!!

For those who seek esoteric knowledge, please don't abandon your logical thinking. "Esotelogic knowlege"

"tecyon energy or tachyons to heal the illness"
<br>
It is well-documented that Jesus could heal people with sickness.
<br>
Let's us take an analog.
<br>
Your computer is infected by a virus. How are you to get rid of the virus? The most important thing is to have a proper virus software. If the virus is new, you have to update your virus definations (information). Then the computer will run and check ITSELF of the virus and eliminate it.However, if you run a few more programmes besides of the virus-software, the computer will take more time to find the virus.
<br>
When someone is ill. The body is trying to heal itself.The speed of a body healing itself depends on how much conscious assistance you have done during healing process and how good is your healing software and the illness itself.The body will find the best solution available to heal from the existing information it can access at that time.
<br>
Jesus had accessed of tremendous amount of information and this useful information was transferred to the patients.
<br>
Personnally, I dont like the idea of 'energy' concept. I prefer coherent information exchange between cells for healthy human body.

<section>
WEll put bomohwkl, I call it concious awareness. Because first you have to be aware that you have a virus and then you have to be aware that other types of information exist. Then you have to be aware of how to utilize the information. Truthseeer, I have the machine and will begin testing it monday. I will hold off on my replies until then unless I have a direct question but I spoke to the developer of the HDR and read over 400 pages of his reports and know where have read or heard him speak about techyon energy.  Where did this come up. He claims that he can explain it in details but how it really works is beyond his comprehension also. That it uses the golden ratio (of course its more then that) and pulls right from the vaccum. He also talks how the information didn't come from him but through him. How many of our scientist have said that they tapped into the theta brain wave pattern and information was given to them by some agreeable or disagreeable being. (they just don't say it to much in public) We know that thought (I hope we know) doesn't initiate in the brain but it exist on its own plane call it the mental plane, 5th plane, etc (esoteric if I must) and that plane is where all past present and future inventions reside. Of course I'm being philosophical but to make a long story short I have heard so much about this HDR and how it works from people who never talked to the developer, tried it, or read the reports about it.

Pseudoscience is the classification of a form of mainstream science that deals with spiritualism. This can involve anything from healing to astral projection to clairvoyance. The study of ESP, if I am correct, is a pseudoscience. Since the scientific community believes that the world is flat, figuratively speaking (through metaphor), we are left with an unimaginative, dead-weight universe.
<br>
<br>
My observation is that pseudoscience bases itself on a dangerous line of circumstancial conclusions and sometimes dimwitted assumptions.
<br>
<br>
Pseudoscience (i.e. scientific spiritualism, parapsycology) is scoffed at because the scientific community feels specialists in this area beat around the bush, rather than using flat, deductive methods to show that all this phenomena really has no meaning to it.
<br>
<br>
The conclusion I make is that pseudoscience is any form of science specializing in the study of transcendalism, without trying to disprove the nature of things in study.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I would only partially relate these devices to pseudoscience. Or perhaps they
<b>
 are
</b>
pseudoscientific. In my opinion, these products are nothing more than a smoke-and-mirrors, capitalist gimmick disguised under science / pseudoscience.
<br>
<br>
I do not believe that most of us here have a very high understanding of an advanced study (university-level / grade 11, grade 12) of physics. Therefore, who can argue against those that pretend to? Con artists specialize at playings games with people's minds. Really, they do. They use technical jargon, worded carefully and properly, and
<i>
 <b>
  appear
 </b>
</i>
to know what they're talking about. It's easier to do this than you think.
<br>
<br>
The devices work, just not in the way you think. Throw in some false statistics and your set. Reminds me of the infocommercials I've seen late at night regarding
<i>
 total weightloss
</i>
adds.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure all of us have recieved emails before from unknown, international billionairs requesting the usaging of our personal accounts in exchange for some of their fortune. How many of us have bought into that?

<br>
<br>
Science uses a process of experiments to pass something as authentic. That is why it's science, because the nature of science attempts to analyze and study phenomenon through practical experimention. The reason spiritualism falls out of this catagory is because it is transcendalist.
<br>
<br>
A simple understanding of the mechanics of something, as well as basic common sense, also aids in the successful formation of opinions.
<br>
These devices have not been around for a short period of time. They've been around for a long time. We're talking about decades here.
<br>
<br>
If pseudoscience has found the key to immortality and the road to universal mastery, science would have been in on it by now. Millions, if not billions of dollars goes into this sort of research each year. To say that amateur con artists have truly discovered currently underdiscovered things is an insult and mockery to our intelligence (and efforts).
<br>
<br>
Thing outside of the box, please. You're talking about devices that grant infinite energy for a small fee. You're talking about devices that allow common citizens to control each other's minds. Atlantican power rods that channel straight into dimension X? How more ridiculous and obscure can this get.
<br>
<br>
What I feel is that people will believe anything as long as there's a device that works, a convincing explanation behind it that somehow ties to spiritualism. If Nike started slapped their logo on these devices, they'd be selling like hotcakes.

"The prefix "psuedo" means false. Pseudoscience, therefore, is a word that refers to "false" science."
<br>
<br>
<br>
-I've heard pseudoscience used in many contexts.  Mostly having to do with what the scientific community considers impure science.. I've heard Psychology called a pseudoscience along with anything that isn't purely mathematical or scientific.  Its always used in a deragotary way.  I try to stay away from the word pseudo anyway because it tells more about what it isnt "a pure science..purely intellectual etc".  And tells nothing about whether its even trying to be scientific or intellectual in the first place.
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Pseudoscience is the classification of a form of mainstream  science  that deals with spiritualism. This can involve anything from healing to astral projection to clairvoyance.
<br>
<br>
Maybe thats the context you've heard it in but pseudoscience can refer to whatever you want to label not a real science. LIke I said i've heard it referring to psychology, or even archeology.. sociology.
<br>
<br>
"Pseudoscience (i.e. scientific spiritualism, parapsycology) is scoffed at because the scientific community feels specialists in this area beat around the bush, rather than using flat, deductive methods to show that all this phenomena really has no meaning to it."
<br>
<br>
Thats not actually the only reason they scoff at it.  They scoff at it because they dont believe it exists.  Not because of how the specialists "beat around the bush".  They go into it with set beliefs.. Even if a person used deductive methods if they dont show a certain result they're a pseudo science.
<br>
<br>
"If pseudoscience has found the key to immortality and the road to universal mastery, science would have been in on it by now."
<br>
<br>
- You cant find things where A) you're not looking B) what you dont believe in so wont bother to look into.
<br>
<br>
If science hasn't found the cure to the common cold what makes you think they would have solved the key to immortality?  Do you really have that much faith in science?
<br>
<br>
"N.E.W. falls into the catagory of pseudoscience. Most of what is said remains unsupported. Not that I'm not practicing N.E.W. myself. I simply feel that he could zing it up with more . . . believable facts to convince the hardheads that there's something going on besides a mind-over-matter effect"
<br>
<br>
-  What kind of facts could you produce?  Temperature only would indicate their body temp has gone up.  This could be because of stress or many other things.
<br>
<br>
All evidence in this field is subjective.  It would be a waste of time to try to prove this stuff to the "hardheads".  Why would you want to anyway?  Its personal and should stay that way.  When you get into this stuff you look for proof for yourself.. try proving to your best friend this is real.  Let alone scientists who KNOW its not..
<br>
<br>
I would never waste my time doing it.  Plus why would you want to?  I find most people who wwant to prove it want to say "see i was right"  or to prove they're not crazy.
<br>
<br>
I think people should continue helping the people who already believe.. and ignore the ones who try to dismiss such things and who want you to prove it to them.
<br>
<br>
"When writing an essay, every single statement you make must have a citation behind it (aside from exposiated personal opinion). If you write an essay in post-secondary institutions (and even in grade 12) with unsupported details, you'll surely fail."
<br>
<br>
- Are you in University yet?  What type of essay are you talking about?  An essay in literature obviously wouldnt need citations.  An essay in philosophy where you're telling your beliefs wouldnt either,. And the only things you need citations for in history etc are ideas you're taking from other people.  If you're making your own deductions you dont need to cite anyone.
<br>
<br>
Essay is so broad.  If you're writing for a medical journal you need more citations.  But if you're not writing for one you cite ideas you're taking from another source.  RB wasn't trying to prove anything in NEW they were instructions.  Who would he site if he was writing instructions of a techique he Wrote up himself???
<br>
<br>
"It's a placebo over an actual device."
<br>
<br>
No its not a placebo its a sham.
<br>
A placebo is something that actually has an effect on someone.. but the device didn't actually cause the effect.  Placebos are used in medicine to see which medicines actually work and which work because people think they work.
<br>
<br>
Its only a placebo if people time travel anyway but think its because of the device but it actually isn't.
<br>
<br>
Its not if it just plain doesn't work which is what this thing most likely will do.

I agree that things like OBE aren't trying to utilize theories in order to make devices. If a device is trying to implement scientific theories in order to make a device that term would apply.  But not to something that isnt using science in anyway to explain it.

<section>
Goingslow,
<br>
You're right. It seems there are different interpretations for the word Pseudoscience. The meaning I found referred to it as sham or fake science, whereas what you've found interprets it as studies that don't fall into the categories of pure science.I hadn't thought of it that way. Perhaps
<i>
 quasi
</i>
science might also work as a description here.
<br>
<br>
Whatever the case it might be best to remove the word "science" from this discussion altogether and just work with the word "
<b>
 sham
</b>
". I think its more appropriate for this topic.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of shams, with reference to the advertising blurb in the first link of Asstray85's opening post, I'd still like to know what the hell a

After reading this I concluded that buying a time machine which can give pleasure only up to 2013 because after this time all will be the same. Why would anybody buy it then? Shooting in your own foot?

So anybody who buys this stuff. Please focus up to 2020 and have fun..

Steven Gibbs: When they sent some scientists from the Montauk Project into Earth's future they hit a barrier in the year 2012. When they tried to go past the barrier from 2012 to 2013 they couldn't go through the barrier, they could only go around it. But after they went around it they found that all life on this planet had been wiped out...everything. Cities were all in ruins and there was no life found anywhere...at least they couldn't find any. They concluded that everything had been wiped-out.

Most people simply dismiss the Montauk conspiracy away as being nothing more than science fiction of overactive imagination. However the concept of the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum physics theorizes that there are many, many alternate earths existing in paralell planes (or other dimensions). Variations of MWI posit either alternative universes or branching paralell timelines.
<br>
The important point is that MWI provides a theoretical framework in which the events of the Montauk Timeline could take place.
<br>
It is for just that reason that I advise great caution when dealing with the Montauk conspiracy. Is it possible that some of the people involved in Montauk, for one reason or another, actually believe in the reality of the Montauk events??

truth to that. One possibility is that one of those people had an out of body experience and encountered (hostile) aliens. There are other possibilities. The point that I wish to make is that Consciousness can, to a certain degree, form, shape and create the reality around us. This goes beyond , "Be careful what you wish for", to "Be careful what you constantly think about". In my view there are an over ample supply of problems in the world without dwelling on the possibility that Time-Nazis and aliens are secretly allied and engaged in an ongoing battle against the CIA!!

Actually, come to think about it, I'm surprised there hasn't been a Montauk movie made already.

Hardly a day goes by without someone, somewhere declaring the world will end on so-and-so date. Under such circumstances, someone has to be right eventually. But only in the sense that even a broken clock tells the right time at least once a day.
<br>
<br>
I remember when at primary school, one of my pals was a devout Jehova's Witness. Or at least his parents were. Not sure of my dates, here but it must have been in the late 1960's when he went with his family to meet loads of other people, at some particular place, and await the end of the world. The idea being they were the ones who would be "saved". Of course, I was too young to comprehend the full context of what was happening, but the memory sticks in mind as we used to talk about it, "in secret".
<br>
<br>
Since then, how many times have these doomsday dates come and gone. The top of the
<i>
 Damp-Squib Of All Time
</i>
league table must surely be the Millenium Bug. The Montauk Conspiracy is gathering pace and could well be a strong contender to take the title. It's early days yet. But the announcement of Movie Rights would naturally boost its chances.

if someone will tell you the world is going to end RUN!!! The world never ends. Yes theres cycles and to the ignorant of our world it feels that the world is ending but look in the past, mayan, egyptians, assyrians, hittie's, atlantians, etc they are gone (Well most of them) but THE EARTH IS STILL HERE. I wasn't going to post anything about the last three post but many people think 2012 will be the end. What will happen is the earth is ready for its transistion in the evolutionary scheme to move from more of a 3rd dimensionary vibratory rate to a 4th. Since we get out life sustaining energy from the sun (PRANA) and the earth's magnetic field (Kundalini) then when either one of those changes we change. Well both are moving around pleadies which will move us into the Aquarian age (golden age) the energy will be so strong of AUM (PURE LOVE) that quoting a friend of mine "ENTER NOW OR DIE" meaning that those who are ready will continue to have a physical vehicle before and after the transition but those who are not will be disembodied and hopefully by their guides be able to reincarnate back onto earth (Gaia, Tara, Qi) in the better divine order. Now the montauk project when they went to 2012 since their instruments where limited in their ability to see and do they percieved this CURRENT TIME LINE ONLY. Seeing into the 3rd deminsion. It looked like everyone was dead, but if they would have shorten the wave legnths or increased the frequency and went to the 4th dimension they would still see SOME of us. Now the earth isn't stopping there, our great mother nature wants to operate from the 5th dimension. The plane of mental thought. Many call it Malakuth. That way all secrets will be revealed and their will be an end to all HIDDEN AGENDAS (Have you ever heard a war to end all wars before!) because the dna in the human that lies dormant will awaken and we will be able to influence the matter and anitmatter around us by thought alone. Imagine a 5 dimeinsional physical vehicle (body). Now montauk, is just like me landing in the desert in california or Neveda and looking all around and saying I don't see any life, theirs nothing but dry, hot, sand. This place is deserted, (even though they saw what appeared to be dead bodies) they made their conclusion out of an incomplete observation. For all of you just prepare your mind, emotions, and body for this move. Yes is will be a lot of chaos on earth but you can't have change without chaos. (Changing water to ice, involves change in the molecular structure of the water, which is chaos to the atoms, even though we find it quite normal. The earth will be chaos, although naturally, on a macro scale) I can say the CHAOS ISN"T NO WHERE AS BAD AS ALL THE DOOMSDAY PEOPLE PREACHING. I"M Trying to test out

Remember like frank said a broken clock is right twice a day. At any given nanosecond the earth has the potential to destroy surface dwellers and renew itself. Meaning that almost anytime can be said to be the end of the world but these cycles Dark and Light will continue to rotate and rotate and rotate forever.

This link might be more reliable and safer than the HDR. I found this link this weekend so i haven't built the headset or anything. The unregistured version can only be opened 21 times so make sure you read through it throughly before closing it. i believe the dual mono building instructions will prompt you to print them out.

Art Bell never tried the HDR. He pluged it in and it heated up to what he believed to be an unsafe temperture so he unpuged it and forgot about it.

Well you try that and let us know. I have cut on the HDR Plenty of times and don't experience any overheated energy coming from the magnet. I would say in all cases if the machine worked I wouldn't wont everyone to know. Especially in arts case with 14 million listeners. Imagine 10 million orders and about 8 million ignorant people trying it. It just wouldn't be right. Also its been 10 years since then and the magnent has been upgraded from the original hdr just like you would have a better engine being made now then 10 years ago (Well that depends, if your in to cars you know what I mean) TEST YOUR VERSION OUT THAT OUT AND LET ME KNOW) I deal a lot with esoteric information and I like things explained that way. Since you can tie spiritual and science together when you deal with esoteric information. That was what I was looking for when I researched the HDR and thats what I got. I will wait and see what you get from this other device but like I said many post which this can be applied to everyone. Don't assume that another device is better or safer, etc

<section>
I'm here, no need for alarm, etc. I always take precautions before I try anything. I had a full report to give, step by step of my process but know I realize that all that is uneccessary. I will instead just cut to the chase
<b>
 The machine appears to work. I had an astral projection.
</b>
With the amount of eletromagnatism I put into my navel chakra I know it was bound to do something. I do have mixed messages. As a semi scientist (meaning I use the scientific method but don't want to be caught in dogma like other scientist) I feel that this could be coincidence. What I mean by that is that I didn't do any double blind test etc on it. I just used the machine. It makes me wonder becasue the machine says after you use it cut it off and then put yourself in a mediative state (just between sleep and awake) then do any of the normal things you would do to try to astral project. This is what I did, but anyone doing that could have an astral projection without the machine. Also I live in the Memphis, Mississippi, Arkansas tri state area and anyone who is paying attention to the news sees that we been having tornados and storms. It rained so hard last night producing so much negative ions from the lightning (THATS GOOD) that almost anyone could have astral projected last night. The only difference from using the machine then me doing it naturally is that I felt a little different and I came out a different way. I was in the densest astral form (many know what I"m talking about)where I still felt VERY physical. So I do beleive the machine worked but I also believe more experimentation needs to be done because know inventor trys something on one person and has a complete acceptance that his machine works.
<b>
 What I would like to try is for someone who has never astral projected conciously to try the machine and see what happens.
</b>
That way I will have a better lean on the machine then just me making me do it on my own or nature being just right at the time. Will I try the machine again. Yes, now that I see that it wasn't initially harmful I will, but know one needs to be constantly putting that amount of energy over their solar plexus frequently. So it will be a while maybe not even this month.  I know many was looking for a better observation then this or just a IT DOESN"T WORK. But I"m impressed so far and think further experimentation is needed. I'm now waiting to see what others who have the machine have to say about it. I purchased mine from steven gibbs. Thinking that I should get it from the original inventor and i purchased the time travel plans from
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.futurehorizons.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.futurehorizons.net/
</a>
The plans are a good read for anyone, very good information in there. Although like it has been stated I was wondering about the website for steven gibbs since it isn't that productive. Speaking to him he said that he doesn't control any of the websites. He recieved orders from others and he makes the machine and give it to those who took the orders to ship it or he ships it himself. He said he made the machine a while ago and of course after it worked and showing it to friends they told him he should sell it. He agreed but didn't want to handle orders to so others did that and the horrible website is the result of others (the
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.hdrenterprises.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.hdrenterprises.net/
</a>
is not maintained by steven) Being as it may, he was refered to go onto the art bell show by friends and being contacted (you know art bell was fascinated with time travel) I don't know anything about the use of the machine for time travel but as steven said all you need is more energy, being on a natural earth grid point during the full moon. Well thats not my avenue. So in closing I lean on the side of the machine working but further use with it will give me better accountability. If there isn't any questions for me, then this topic can be closed Posted are pictures of the same machine modulated to work better. Many might have seen these already

<section>
well thats the catch, I already know how to astral project so once out its up to me. Thats the same for almost anyone, once out its up to you to stay out unless you get fearful or your body needs you for any type of reason. The length of time staying out depends on you. I was out for a while but I'm always out for a while (NOT IN THE BEGINING THOUGH, TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET OVER FEAR) well let me take that back some times I get out then get slammed right back in my body for all types of reason. Thats why I said that it seems to work but at the same time more experimentation needs to be done. I suggest trying it on someone who never had an OBE before. Since after you try it you have to put yourself in to a state to astral project and anyone who knows how to do it already will just do it by going to that state. If I was scientist I would suggest trying it on someone who never heard of astral projection and on someone who has tried endlessly and has failed. I didn't think about my own ability to astral project coming into account and really theres no way around that because everytime I try the machine I will just go into a state of meditation and OBE. I can say though if it tingles at my solar  plexus and I come out there everytime instead of out of my head then I know its the machine but I don't plan on trying it again for 2 weeks for obvious reasons, you shouldn't just be shooting your charkras with eletromagnetism to much in this way. I don't know if its harmful but EVERYTHING IN MODERATION
<br>
To be more specific during meditation I lose track of time but it seemed like 30 mins of meditation after 3 mins of using the machine. I think the time depends on the person again here comes the mixed messages because it took me 30 mins and its the time it takes you to go to the theta/delta brain wave pattern borderline. Meaning just awake and sleep. This can be done by some in seconds, minutes, or hours, Depends on the person. Also some just fall asleep and awaken out of there body. I was concious through the meditation to OBE and I felt the vibriations like normal. My heart did feel funny, I'm not going to lie I was getting scared thinking this machine was going to give me a stroke or an heart attack (thats how it was nugging, not strong but still you never know) I didn't panic I just relaxed and kept meditating thinking I planned for the worst and to be disembodied was the worst that I planned for but that pain went away and the vibriations got stronger (that was my first difference then normal) the vibrations got stronger my solar plexus was tingling stronger then normal (thats where I put the magnet on during the 3 mins) then I thought to my self I"m above my body I"m out of my body (thats my method when I feel the vibrations many do differen't things. I tried to direct my attention to my pineal gland (third eye to leave but was having trouble) then I started to float out by my solar plexus then I promise you I felt my heart hurting again this time worst and if it wasn't for me relaxing myself and letting what ever happened, happen (even death) I probably would have stopped everything. But then I was out. I was more dense (physical looking) then normal,(this was my second difference then normal) From there I was out and the rest was up to me to get clarity "clarity now" and to make my body less dense. After the experience (I don't have to be anywhere special in the morning) I oversleep. I had a great nights sleep but thats normal for an astral projection depending on what plane you go to. I don't really need to go into the details of what I did while out since the topic is can the machine get you out. What you do when you out is up to you. I can say that it was a differen't then normal way of getting out and feeling when I was first out but I was able to stay out average like any other time. ALSO I FORGOT, I tried it with the crystal. I cleansed the crystal with a smudge stick and played the chakra chimes key notes C-B over the  crystal, prayed with it, then put it in the witness well. I did this because in the instructions it says that if you don't get results use the crystal. I didn't want to not get results then rationilze that it wasn't powerful enough then wait two weeks or so and do it with the crystal since I know others was waiting for what I had to say. Next time I want use the crystal to see what that will do for me. I hope this helps. I suggest if you have the money to get it and let me know. I plan to use it again but I dont hang around that many non spiritual people. I can move the machine around my circle but it would be best if it was tried on someone who never had an OBE before that is when I will know for a fact if it worked or not. Right now I'm 70/30 leaning towards the machine I would rather like to be 95/5 or better. buts right now thats on just things being a little different then normal and because astral projection is a wide experience what I experience with the machine also could have been normal. I'm open minded, everyone out there tell me what you think.

<section>
Ok, first of all I see the lack of information in your statement. Thats nothing wrong with that if your trying to learn. What I mean by that is you need to know what your getting into because your really getting into something here. I don't know what your purpose is for time travel and again I said I never used it for that. I suggest buying all the reports from future horizons about time travel and reading them first. They are about $200, learn about crystals, earth grid points, dowsing, and the moon cycles. I suggest just astral travel because most of the spiritual growth you want to obtain at this level can be done there. Again this is all about what your trying to do. I suggest giving us a clue so we can guide you in the best way but the final decision is yours. I don't recommend anyone time traveling without spiritual development of assistance from a master of some sort. I don't even recommend time travel for myself. I don't see the need because if you realize that you can control time and that time is what you make it, then you can start your life from NOW. Live in the now. Plus you want really change this time line but go to an alternate dimension also you don't know how much your life effects everyone. For example just say you decide to go back and change an event then what the outcome will be may not be what you expected, then you go back to change that one and the original one and so on and so on where you run your life constantly changing things over and over. Where its not an event or time period in your life that was important to change etc. Its the pattern. You need to change your pattern or  behavior and live in the now, plus astral projection is must more rewarding. I also say that there are beings out there that love to prey on ignorant travelers, so hopefully your grounded in some type of spiritual calling.  PLus about astral travel being in the same space as physical, that is right many wont be able to see you but you can see them. THe thing is once out you are so fascinated with astral travel that you care less for going to visit others, also sometimes your subconcious takes control and shows you what you need to see (which most of the time your not even aware of) also its not as easy as it seems. I would say since this is all new to you to learn just how to stay out of your body and to remove fear. It seems as though you want to spy on an event etc. This can be done in OBE but it is diffuclt for the beginner. The closes I have gotten to phyiscal time travel (remember we aren't talking about astral projection) is changing time zones. [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
] I don't think your ready, to each there own. If I may ask what are you trying to accomplish because there can be better or other ways to go about it.
<br>
<br>
Remember I also said more experimentation needs to be done before I even conclude over 90% that the machine works.

Lol man there will be more tornados, hurricans etc as the planet cleanses its self. Tornados are the planets air condition, it uses them to cool itself off. Their mainly being created by the sun and moon cycles we have some sun and moon cycles right now and just wait to august then just wait to october, This will be a difficult year for some but we always pick up afterwards and time goes on. But the tornados cause is way bigger then some machine. You also need to look into the government harrp project and all kinds of other weather experiments that are going on. A  lot of this is experiments by public and private sectors (mostly not benificial to us) and the other is the sun and the moon which may not appear at first but is very benifical to us. Just get to researching.

well, i was just wondering that why everyone is so quiet after mrnitro wrote abt the experience with HDR. there were a couple of people trying to prove HDR and Steven Gibbs wrong and seemed very confident abt their statements and knowledge but all have disappeared suddenly. for anyone who just has the bookish knowledge, never try to condemn someone unless u have tried it. just by looking at the schematic of HDR u are trying to prove ur knowledge of theoretical physics that HDR can't work as steve say si s highly unacceptable. if u cant dare to spend just $360 for the sake of knowledge, better be quiet as u are now. never believe wat u hear, and just half of wat u see. dont try to put anyone down unless u know u could. never say anything bad abt sir steven gibbs, u shud accept this for a simple fact that atleast he is in discussion and in news even if his HDR doesnt work, but u are not discussed anywhere, so that guy is above u.

Tangi: I, for one, have nothing further to say because there

nothing further to say (no reply is often the answer). Certain effects did come about but nothing that could remotely be called proof of the machine's effectiveness. Plus, I note the person in question did not report having travelled through time.
<br>
<br>
In your latest post you talk about looking at a schematic of HDR allied to theoretical physics. The published schematic of this device is not to component level. However, I have seen component-level schematics of other devices which have equally fantastic claims attached. I note the components used are of a *very* basic type, and their connected effects are well known to anyone who understands electronics. So there's nothing remotely "theoretical" going on here.
<br>
<br>
I've neither spoken to the promoter, nor have anything against him. On the contrary, the commercial arena has always accommodated all types of novelty-value products, and long may it continue to do so. The axiom of caveat-emptor is something I've always supported and is, of course, the reason why $360 of my money is being sent nowhere.

Our Physical body being an integral part of the universe, can learn how to access the arkartic record.
<br>
<br>
Physically travel into the future is forbidden by the Universal law of the Creator of the universe. I am very sure but would accept if  mrnitro has proven otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, most people, when they have OBEs, their visons aren't as clear as reality and the visions always blur. Does HDR allow you to have vision as clear as reality? I know that when my passedaway grandmother directly assisting my OBE, I had vision as clear as physical world and navigation with no difficulty.
<br>
<br>
Even if there is a machine that can really help you to project into other world with vision as clear as physical world and with navigation as instant as the mind says so, we shouldn't depend on such machine as we ourself are capable to do it with proper training. It should be 100% mind stuff.

Are we now blaming the government for secret experiments for strange weather occurance? Cleansing? Cleanse what? Human beings and their construction I supposed. Human beings are the disease of the mother earth. We are to be blamed for damaging the environment? Have you taken conscious effort to save the mother earth? What happen when the cleansing failed? The death of mother earth? We died results of our own ignorance and arrogance? Will there be any aliens or spiritual masters that automatically save us from such catastrophic disaster? Death of morher earth. Then we all passed into astral world waiting to be reborn to learn the mistakes. This post is irrevelant to HDR discussion. If you want to discuss further, make a new topic.

Lol, FRANK good post. First I never said anything about Time Travel. I said I had an OBE, I also said that further experimentation will be needed to be over 90% sure that the machine works and it wasn't just me doing it from deep meditation. Plus there is nothing to gain from this but experience (which can be good) so there is no need to wonder why everyone is so quite about it now. (there will always be skeptics and beleivers) I did what I said I would do and unless a real scientific body would study the machine (which I beleive has happened just the information isn't public) then there is not much more to be said about it unless others have it and have specific questions on the use of it

  Are we now blaming the government for secret experiments for strange weather occurance? Cleansing? Cleanse what? Human beings and their construction I supposed. What happen when the cleansing failed? The death of mother earth? We died results of our own ignorance and arrogance? Will there be any aliens or spiritual masters that automatically save us from such catastrophic disaster?

First it can help to do some research.  I don't know what present information you have so and I'm not the one to judge anyone since we are all on our own path. If I'm not mistaken bomohwkl you asked me if the machine is creating tornados and I told you why tornados are happening and what purpose they serve. Am I blaming the government. I deal with
<b>
 facts
</b>
. Man just reserach the harrp project for one. There so many damn experiements going on above and under ground its crazy. Dulce air force base, in russia using telsa coils, etc. About mother nature. This planet is concious and has always been so. Its sick and tired of what people have done to her and is cleansing her self. Removing the people who aren't in tune with her. I can say research the earths mangetic frequency and how it effects us, the mayan prophecies, 2012 (NOT! the doomsday stuff about it), Solar and mooon cycles, kundalini and prana, zero point energy and scalar waves, the aquarian age, the golden age, egyptian mysteries and cycles and that should give you an overview of what I mean by cleansing. I agree that we have been a thorn in mother earths back, plus i have done bad things to the envirnoment
<b>
 before i woke up
</b>
. Earth has cleansed itself before. Thats why its called a cycles happening every 25,000 years, every 12,500 years, every 5,100 years, every 3600 years, every 2,100 years, (all those are differen't cycles and their are smaller and bigger ones) many past cultures weren't wipped out by war but wipped out by the cycles. (This can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. We have seasons that kill plants then regrows them, this is a macro change of season, from winter to spring.)  About your alien, spiritual master question. Many are already here more will come as the energies from the sun change. The sun is like a huge chakra systems. THeirs a saying they can only help those who help themselves. What I mean is their are many Spiritual Master contacts because they have raised themselves to be able to be in the energy of one.

About your OBE being blurry, you need to just request that its not, also about time travel while out of body it depends on the personals control and spiritual growth, yes their are guardians of each plane but you can raise yourself to do almost anything if you just raise yourself. It takes commitment but thats what we are all striving for anyway. (Even if we don't know it) I don't recommend any and everyone going out to get the HDR only if you have tired to do it naturally and have failed. I always push for the natural way in everything. Because if we continue to put the power on machine and drugs outside ourself we will never learn to awaken the light inside ourselves.

I don't doubt that that a device like the HDR could help to induce an obe, but the schematics on the site are hillarious. Looked to me like someone has managed to succesfully breed a static electricity generator and a lightbulb[

June 1997
<br>
<br>
The Steven Gibbs Time Machine
<br>
<br>
I have had my Gibb's Time Machine the (Hyper-Dimensional Resonator) well over one year now.  I have talked to Steven Gibbs by phone two times regarding my order and one time after I received the machine and his nine books.  I am not here to sell anyone on buying a machine or not to buy a machine.  I personally would buy the time machine again, It all depends on why a person wants the time machine in the first place.  I also feel, the nine books, Steven wrote are a good starting point on the subject of time travel and are not very deep.
<br>
I feel Steven's Time Machine is real and does work as a time machine, but first it has some small and large problems.  The four small problems can be very easily fixed before using the time machine.  Problem #2 is the larger problem and cannot be fixed every easily.
<br>
<br>
1. The electric shock problem - The machine uses a time cord which is placed around the persons head, which has 120 volts of AC power coming out of your home wall plug.  Most wall plugs in your home are fused at 15 or 20 Amps.  This much electric current or power in Amps can hurt a person if the time cord had a short or cut in the wiring.
<br>
The Fix: The problem was fixed by going to Radio Shack and buying the following: One package of 3 Amp fast blow fuses and a fuse housing to hold the fuse.   Next you drill a small hole in the side of the Time Machine Box the size of the fuse housing.  Then place the new fuse housing in the new hole and tighten it on place.  Next, cut one of the AC wires coming for the wall plug cord in half.  Solder the two cut AC wires to the two connections found on the fuse housing.  (NOTE:  Never fix or cut the wires when the AC plug is plugged in the wall.)
<br>
<br>
2. The poor tuning - The Time Machine's next problem is a big problem, no range or tuning.  There are two small knobs or dials used to control the tuning of the machine.  One for the dials is the main tuning dial and the other is a main tuner dial in serials with the first dial.  When tuning the dials, you must also use the rubbing plate on the machine to tune the dials.  When you find the point where your fingers stick to the rubbing plate means that you are close to the tuning point your looking for, per Steven's enclosed user's guide. The main problem I have had is that the machine doesn't  have the range of tuning required in order to work right.  It is like trying to find the Art Bell Show through all of the thousands of AM and FM stations.  There are two dials and a rubbing plate to find stations such as the Art Bell Radio Show when tuning the whole Electromagnet Bands from DC though the X-ray bands.  The chances for success are not very good when there is almost no range or tuning available to find the Art Bell Show or the setting for Time Travel targets.
<br>
The Fix: I feel it needs 10 to 16 more fine tuning stages or dials for success when using the device for physical time travel, astral time travel and/or remote viewing places or dates in time.
<br>
<br>
3. The sample well and the quartz crystal - Each machine has a small 1" x .25" double terminated quartz crystal used in the sample well.  Next the operator must use typing paper with their own saliva on it. The quartz crystal and saliva will help tune the time machine better. (Per the owner manual)
<br>
The Fix: A sample well for saliva and quartz crystals is used on most radionics devices when radionics healing is being done.  I feel the time machine needs a larger quartz crystal.  The size I use is 3" x 1" rounded on one end and pointed on the other end.  I do not use the saliva sample.  The clear colored  larger quartz crystal can be used as focusing point for the machine energy then you try to tune the dials.
<br>
<br>
4. The heavy AC electromagnet and small bar magnet - The heavy AC electromagnet used is a good size to be used on this time machine.  It is strong enough to make the machine work, but the small bar magnet is too small for the large electromagnet coil.  The operations manual states that the small bar magnet must be placed on the end of the AC electromagnet so it repels north to north on the AC electromagnet iron frame.  When the AC electromagnet is used with the permanent bar magnet, it vibrates at 60 cycles per second.  If this small bar magnet if working right when placed on your lower chakra (the naval area).  This will make your whole lower chakra vibrate at 60 cycles per second which the natural vibrations of the universe.  This is also the same 60 cycles used by the great Philadelphia Experiment in 1946. (The ship that traveled in time)
<br>
The Fix: The heavy AC electromagnet works great but the small bar magnet needs to be large and stronger.  I used a 2" x 2" x .5"  Neodymium 35. permanent magnet.  This strong Neodymium 35 magnet has
<br>
4 square inches of north surface area to use.  When placing the larger and stronger magnet on your naval area, this helps to closely aline your own body to the 60 cycles natural vibrations of the universe.  This should allow you to do physical time travel, astral time travel, or remote viewing to places or dates in time.
<br>
<br>
5. A time grid line or a natural energy point - If you listen to Steven Gibbs w hen he talks about energy points they are bad or good points.  I feel he is right that the good and bad spots found is natural.  A person should always take care when near a natural energy point because it can alter your machine's time settings.  You could open doors into bad or good alternate dimensions in time that you may not be able to close again.
<br>
The Fix: The best fix is never to operate a working time device near any active time grid lines or natural energy points.  If your time machine is a working machine, then it should work very well when there are no active time grid lines or natural energy points around.
<br>
I have done all the fixes listed above with the exception of number #2.  When you review the time and money spent you would be better to start over and not try to add 10 to 16 more fine tuning stages or dials.  In doing all but #2 repairs:  The following things have happened to me using the Gibbs time machine.
<br>
<br>
1. I have never done physical time travel using Steven's time machine.  I feel the chances of physical time travel are one in about one billion of it happening. (See problem #2 and why)
<br>
<br>
2. I have had success and here is my story.  About a month after receiving the time machine I used it to astral project in time for about four days. One day before a full moon I projected four days into the future which was Wednesday of the following week.  I was viewing my city's front page newspaper.  On the front page of the Wednesday newspaper I saw a full color picture of wreckage and destruction.  I was not sure if it was a bad tornado or earthquake.  Well when Wednesday came I hurried to view the front page.  I saw on the front page the following: It had a picture of mass destruction from a tornado, which had hit and destroyed most of a small town in Texas.  This was about the first or second week of May in 1997.  This machine of Steven Gibbs works well as a radionics astral time travel for remote viewing places and/or dates in time.  I have also traveled to other times over the past year with the same success.  For the best success you should do your traveling two days before or after the full moon or on the full moon.
<br>
<br>
PLEASE NOTE: I found that the range on my machine is about 4 to 7 days in the future, not weeks, months or years.  I am not sure, but I think because of the poor tuning of the machine your own mind corrects some of the bad tuning errors.  The greatest range I have gotten out of the time machine is about 4 to 7 days.
<br>
<br>
3. When your using the time machine for radionics astral time travel and/or remote viewing places or dates in time; then you must use the two dial settings and rubbing plate. Also use the large electromagnet and permanent magnet while tuning the machine to the time you want.  After you complete the tuning and use of the electromagnetic magnet which is pulsing at 60 cycles per second with the time coils around your head you can turn every thing off.  Next you lay down on a bed or other comfortable surface and concentrate on what your time target is.  After a few minutes of concentration you will start to see and/or hear sounds.  The information is extremely subtle and you still feel the pulsing of the 60 cycles per second on your lower body parts.  Next, you will start to experience the following:  You will start to hear voices or see pictures in your own minds eye.  It is so subtle that you would tend to believe or think that it was your own mind talking to you, on your time trip.  The difference between your mind talking too you and this type of Astral Time Travel is when you review the events later and all starts to come true.  If it was your own mind talking to you all the things would never probably come true or happen on the date you're Astral Time Travel said it would.
<br>
<br>
4. Now is the time for you the reader to judge if this time machine is for you are not.  Yes, I would buy the time machine again.  You should also note that Steven Gibbs is NOT the only source for time machines and time travel information.  There are many others if you look.  Steven Gibbs is just the most known in the field of time travel today. In time, I feel many other people will come to be known also.  Steven Gibbs will go down in history as the first person to sell time travel machines.  There is also a good friend of mine Alfred Bielek who is known as the very first person to travel in time and come back to talk about his time travel.  And Phil Schneider that was killed in 1996, if you do not know the name, look it up on the Internet.

<section>
I received an E-mail from a person that owns a Steven Gibbs Hyper-dimensional Resonator.   Here are his Five E-mail questions.
<br>
<br>
1.  A time grid line or a natural energy point - you said that the best fix is never to operate a working time device near any active time grid lines or natural energy points.   Are you saying that the HDR does not have to be near a time grid line to do physical time travel?  I thought that you had to have a power inverter to connect to a cigarette lighter in a car and also the power inverter was also connected to the HDR and also you have to have a time grid line.
<br>
1. A.  Yes, for best results a time grid line or a natural energy point is used.  I would personally never used my Hyper-dimensional Resonator near any active time grid lines or natural energy points.   Because you do not have control over the Hyper-dimensional Resonator time unit.  The main problem is that, the machine doesn't have the range for tuning, required in order to work right.  There are two dials and a rubbing plate, it's like trying to find the Art Bell Radio Show by tuning the whole Electromagnet Bands from DC though the X-ray bands.  The chances for success are impossible, almost no range or tuning to find the setting for Time Travel targets.  A car power inverter or 120 volt, 60-cycle, 3 Amp source is need to run the machine.
<br>
<br>
2.  The heavy AC electromagnet and small bar magnet - you said that you put a Neodymium 35 permanent magnet on your navel area, which helps to closely align your own body to the 60 cycles natural vibrations of the universe.  I have a barium oxide bar magnet.  It is very powerful.  Would this do?  Could you do physical time travel just by pacing the magnet on the navel area without doing the tuning of the dials on the HDR?
<br>
<br>
2. A.  Yes, any strong permanent magnet will work per Steven Gibb's enclosed operating instructions.  I used a 2" x 2" x .5" Neodymium #35 permanent magnet.   Please understand that I have never used the hyper-dimensional Resonator to do physical time travel.   I used it to astral travel only; no time grid line or a natural energy point was used.  I tried to use the two dials and a rubbing plate and I do not know if it helped or not.  The small bar magnet and heavy AC electromagnet make your whole lower chakra vibrate at 60 cycles per second which the natural vibrations of the universe, per Steven Gibb's.
<br>
<br>
3.  The poor tuning - I have great difficulty in tuning the hyper-dimensional resonator and getting a stick reaction on the rubbing plate.  Will the clear colored larger quartz crystal increase my chances of getting a stick reaction?  A problem I have is that I am not good at visualizing, which is what you do for the time travel targets.  Will this hinder my chances of success?
<br>
<br>
3. A.  Bigger is better to a point, a clear colored larger quartz crystal should increase your chances of getting a stick reaction.  Next, work in your visualizing skills, which will help to target your astral travel, I do not believe physical time travel targets will work using the hyper-dimensional resonator or using time grid lines or a natural energy points.  If you try using, the hyper-dimensional resonator and over real time grid lines or a natural energy points, you may not be able to control the device and you may have a very bad experience, or it may work for you. (Key words here: NO TUNEABLE RANGE)
<br>
<br>
4.  When your using the time machine for radionics astral time travel and/or remote viewing places or dates in time - do you put the magnet on your navel area at the same time that you are tuning the dials?
<br>
<br>
4. A. Yes, see #2 and #3.
<br>
<br>
5.  The sample well a and the quartz crystal - you said you need a larger quartz crystal.  Does it have to be a larger double terminated quartz crystal or will a normal quartz crystal do?
<br>
5. A.  Yes, any good clear quartz crystal larger double terminated quartz crystal or normal single ended quartz crystals will do.   All my large crystal are single ended crystals.
<br>
<br>
Ending comment:  The Steven Gibbs Hyper-dimensional Resonator is a very poor cross between the original 1946 Hieronymus Machine by T. Galen Hieronymus and the 1943 Philadelphia Experiment.  I also believe in the next 5 or 10 years you will see better and more controllable Time Travel machines on the Internet, sold as research devices only.  Good Lucky, I hope I didn't confuse you more.

Professor,
<br>
<br>
I recently purchased the HDR unit. Clearly I need help with this device so that I do not waste time nor injure myself.
<br>
<br>
My first impression of it was the healing seemed to work. I placed the crysal in the well, and also placed the large electromagnet over the naval area. It seemed to immediately improve the arthritis condition I have in my hands, and various other injuries from weightlifting.
<br>
<br>
It's been 2 weeks since I last used it. I thought exposure to this device might be a problem; is it do you think?
<br>
<br>
My main purpose was to time travel and do it physically or quantumly.
<br>
Will this device work for me? Is the electromagnet supplied sufficient, or will I need a barium oxide magnet?
<br>
<br>
Any advice would be greatly apppreciated.
<br>
<br>
Thamnks,

Hi JH,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your posting.   I do not think using the device a harmful to you in any way, the only comment I would make it is that the big magnetic coil does heat up.  I believe that the device can heal people based upon the devices construction, which is based upon work done by Ruth Drown in the 1930s and '40s, she did a lot of the healing with radionics devices and the Hieronymus Machine by T. Galen Hieronymus.
<br>
<br>
Also you need to clean the crystal or other crystals that you may use.  A simple process of sea salt or kosher salt and clean water sat outside for 24 hours does the trick.  You need to clean all crystals which you might be using for healing or other experimentation.
<br>
<br>
And I will like to give you a web site in which I do a lot of posting on time travel, a lot of technical information at this web site regarding the Stephen Gibbs time machine and your web site is a very good for practical information.   Good Lucky JH.

Bunch of crap.  Physical time travel is an impossibility. If you think about it there is no aspect of time travel that is even comprehensible to our human mind. And if a time travel device existed, I asure it would be very world renound.  "$360 to time travel, but the coil heats up on the "delorian" so do be careful.  But if you keep cleaning the crystals all will be fine and you can morph the future into whatever you like it to be... have fun!" Absolutely ridiculous to even give in to such hype!

Toros,
<br>
<br>
But you're here, aren't you? You obviously have an interest in the paranormal, but don't want to experiment and take chances. You just want to run your mouth.
<br>
<br>
That's fine; you can hide in the closet for all I care, but you'll remain uninformed and ignorant.
<br>
<br>
As for my investment of $360.00, that is indeed questionable. I've spent a lot more on other things, and learned a lot less.
<br>
<br>
And thanks for the constructive post.

Mr. T.  Dead,
<br>
<br>
I except and respect your comments Mr. Dead: some points I agree, some point I disagree with in your posting.  I also believe everyone has to right to their own opinions.
<br>
<br>
Here is my opinion for what it's worth:  I believe that if reincarnation is real.  You may have lived during the time of the Noah's Ark and other more resent times.  I believe Noah would have accepted and respected your comments also, "Noah you're crazy to build a large Ark, no sign of rain and not a cloud the sky".   Next, with water up your waist and rain still coming down your still shouting to Noah "the Ark will not float and the rain will stop soon, it's just a fluke in nature, it's raining so hard."
<br>
<br>
There are hundreds of other times when comments like the following were made:
<br>
<br>
"Orville, if man was to fly, God would have gave a man wings to fly".
<br>
<br>
In 1900, "we do not need a new patent office in Washington D.C. because all the patents in the world too date have been invented and their will be no new inventions to come".
<br>
<br>
And again, I thank you for your comments Mr. Dead.

Professor,
<br>
<br>
I read in the other forum about your ideas to alter the HDR. I'm wondering if I can get satisfactory results in its' stock configuration.
<br>
<br>
My instructions say nothing of putting the bar magnet at the end of the electromagnet; should I have done this?
<br>
<br>
Gibbs did mention the barium oxide magnet going over the open end, but I don't know if its worth the $150.00 extra expense.
<br>
<br>
Where did you purchase the magnet and larger crystals you mentioned?
<br>
<br>
And you said you were successful in your first try at astral travel; why did you stop there, and what exactly were the steps you used to achieve it?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>

It is very hard answer you questions, because I bought my machine in 1997.  I have 1997 instructions, you have a newer HDR device, I am not sure what changes have been made if any of the HDR device you have.  On my HDR unit the prominent magnet is used to find north on the elect-magnet T-bar unit.  You can purchase the magnets and larger crystals at more rock shops or metaphysic shops.
<br>
<br>
Yes, I was successful in my first try at astral travel.  My hobby is collecting Time Machines working or not.

So basically a few of you are telling me that you spent $360.00 on a time travel device?  You've physically gone back in time and done, well, whatever you please and it hasn't affected anything?  That the entire destiny of the time we live in now and the entire future of the world lies solely in your hands, for 18 easy payments of 19.95?  You might call it ignorance, but I'm simply aware of the fact that I'm not naive enough to give into such hype.  "The future is not in my hands" you might say.  Consider the possibilities of time travel.  You could entirley stop WW2 from ever happening by just bringing a sophisticated weapon back in time and killing Hitler.  You could teach the 15th century all of our advanced scientific and medical solutions to everyday problems and make the 20th century FAR more advanced then we ever dreamed.  "I wouldn't do that" you might also say.  Well, for only $360.00 and such easy access to a time machine, obviously SOMEONE would commit such acts.  So why haven't they happened yet?  Why hasn't the world heard of this?  And if it's so ignorant for me to believe it doesn't exist, why is it so difficult for me to order... for the low, low price of $360.00?  Excuse my synicism, but I just went into this forum because there were so many readers, and only responded after reading the ridiculous topic.  Excuse my bluntness, but for anyone to believe in such a simple "order the time machine now" solution when science hasn't even brought up the subject is ignorance on your part, not mine.  Curiosity and skeptisism are always healthy, but one must always grasp a certain level of common sense... that's what it's there for.

What you say makes sense, but doesn't preclude the possibility of time travel. I'd recommend going to the library or just surf the web, if this subject is at all interesting to you. You might find there is more to support the theory than you think.

<br>
I just happen to have the time and the resources to do this. I'll believe it only when it happens to me.

<section>
I purchased a hyper-dimensional resonator a few years back
<br>
from Steven L. Gibbs, back when Steven lived in Nebraska.
<br>
<br>
It is a radionics machine.
<br>
<br>
I have used a magnetic flux detector to locate magnetic anomalies
<br>
that Steven calls "grid points".  Some of these grid points are quite large and can be used for travel.
<br>
<br>
I have found that each individual grid point has a "character"
<br>
all its own.
<br>
<br>
According to Steven,
<br>
Positive grid points send you forward,
<br>
Negative grid points send you backward,
<br>
and zero grid points send you parallel worlds.
<br>
<br>
Actually in every "voyage" I have transported to an alternate earth.
<br>
<br>
This appears to prevent a paradox.
<br>
<br>
I can send you information on how to find a vortex.
<br>
<br>
Remember "No Vortex, No Voyage!"

<section>
I have to agree with T.Dead.
<br>
Physical time travel is impossible. For instance: let's say you went to the past to prevent WW2 and you did it. So there never was WW2. So, YOU in the future never knew about it, so how could YOU go back in time to prevent it?
<br>
OR:
<br>
Say you went to the past to kill yourself there. If you did it, that would mean you never existed in the future and never got the chance to kill yourself. You cannot deny this paradox.
<br>
<br>
If men found out how to time-travel anywhere in the distant future there would be no world as we know it. What would prevent some lunatic to go to the distant past and prevent whole human race to evolve to what it is today?

Bravo Mr. Gibbs!
<br>
<br>
Gibbs makes a device that he claims sends people through time.  People are going to want this device are they not?  I mean who wouldn't want to travel through time?  The way I see it, Gibbs is just an entrepreneur looking to make some cash, even if he is making it in a dishonest manner.
<br>
<br>
Buying this HDR is just like buying the "Instant Abs" machines that never work.
<br>
<br>
tomparis2,
<br>
<br>
You have traveled to alternate Earths with each voyage, correct?  So you are telling me that upon arriving at "our" Earth, you actually sat down, found this website, and posted this information?  Please!

Amadeth,
<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'll believe it when I see it. However, what you say isn't necessarily true. If you somehow went back and did this thing you would have then created a different time line, and an alternate universe.
<br>
All I'm saying is this fits in with the time travel theories.
<br>
<br>
Mohamed,
<br>
<br>
I'm a personal trainer so I know the ab machine you refer to doesn't work. And the HDR unit, at least the one I have, appears not to function as well. You're correct.

<section>
I know that getting the HDR to work requires effort on your part.
<br>
<br>
You can add the following to your kit:
<br>
<br>
1) Power inverter - to supply the 3AMP 120V 60 cycle electricity
<br>
2) Tesla coil - to generate the zero vector
<br>
3) Magnetic flux detector - like TRI-FIELD for finding vortex
<br>
4) Plasma Globe - to step up the field
<br>
5) Double terminated quartz crystal - increases power of HDR
<br>
<br>
Remember,  there are several ways to start a fire.
<br>
<br>
Rubbing two sticks for five minutes and saying fire is a fake,
<br>
is a typical DEBUNKER strategy.
<br>
<br>
Keep at it.

Tom,
<br>
<br>
If you're referring to me, you're wrong. I showed determination just ordering it. As for the time I've put in, it's considerably more than 5 minutes. And if I'm going to be buying all those extras, I might as well get another time machine while I;m at it.
<br>
It doesn't matter what side of the conversation you take here; there is going to be alot of crticism.
<br>
It should work as advertised in its original configuration, or it simply is not functional as intended. What I may or may not create from it later on is irrelavent.

"Steve Gibbs' Hyper-Dimensional Resonator (HDR) unit was first called the sonic resonator when the idea for it was given to Steve by two aliens names Paco and Pedro. Paco and Pedro claimed to be time-travelers who read an article Steve had written for a health-related journal published in Canada in 1984.  Paco and Pedro had a circuit that had been used successfully to travel trough time and they offered it to Steve to use at his own risk.  Apparently it was so potent that it had once burst into flames, but Steve managed to construct it without any incidents in a couple of hours.

No out of body experiences either. Time travel and astral projection does seem far fetched. But there is no denying that white light energy does something. Perhaps if it was channeled differently, and the bigger permanent magnet might help that I never bothered getting.

was like a thin veil was separating us and i could see thru it.I could see people moving,going about their business...none seemed to see me.
<br>
I have spontaneously astral traveled in time without a machine about 10 years ago.That's how I know it is possible.
<br>
Also some people have seen me in the 70's as an adult(swear they did) and in 70's I was only a little child. :-O
<br>
Hope this info has helped you....take care!

Time Traveler,
<br>
<br>
Did you operate it according to the instructions by Gibbs , and use the machine right out of the box without alterations?

Time,
<br>
<br>
Two small bar magnets were included. I just use them to find true north, but I suppose one , or both,  could be put on the end of the large electromagnet.
<br>
<br>
S.Gibbs also sells a large barium oxide magnet for this purpose. Did you do any of this?

lol the website doesn't work anymore he must of scammed someone out of $360.00 USD. I also think asstray85/TimeTraveler are the same person lol, a moderator could look into that just check the IP of asstray85/TimeTraveler see if they are the same. [

Maybe the aliens finally got Gibbs -lol- strange dude, mixing religion, UFOs, and time travel into one completely upsurd mess---still , for me it was about the risk, ($360) versus the gain ( alot).

On the radio Monday night. Nothing to add to this long discussion but, The machine does work for astral projection or it appears that way but not for anyone who doesn't have their 4 dna strand active (heart chakra). So if you don't, you have to use it for healing for months to build up to that. THat will be my final word on that. No questions on "what is the d chakra" "how do I know mine is active" there is plenty of information out there on that. IF I had to do it all over again I wouldn't have bought the machine. Its just getting to easy to astral project natuarly. Also steven gibbs time travel incident was by accident (some what of unexpected) He has told me over the phone that you can use it for time travel over a vortex but this is a work in progress. Basically stating that you use the machine with knowledge of your own to pull it off. Research of upgrading to the machine. That I have not done. This topic can really be ended because their are to many better HEALING machines, its to easier to astral project, and for time travel this machine doesn't cut the mustard. Spend your money on something better.

ok kerrblur...listen to this one....we all astral travel....consciously or unconsciously....during sleep.
<br>
If you're in dreaming in color or dreaming that you're flying,chances are you're astral traveling....very few people do it consciously though.Hope that has helped.

Hello, See I know this very well, I know it all.

But I am talking about this product.  Does this product help your mind/body adjust naturally to a conscious projection?  I want to know about the product!

That damn thing is bonking dangerous. Anybody that buys it and uses it is in danger of being electocuted. I'm a retired EE and if the UL ever had real powers it would put this turkey in jail.
<br>
<br>
As about it doing anything, It won't unless your brain is already wound up like a spring.  All this guy does is put a bunch of dials and POTs and puts them in series. Did he really fail Physics in HS? You bet he did! Better you should play Tiddlywinks!

As I stated yes the machine helps but its just better to do it natuarlly. I learned a lot since I bought the machine and if I had to do it all over I again. I wouldn't buy it. Not saying it doesn't work just why pay money when you can just do it on your own natuarlly. Some people are able to astral project and some aren't. Everyone is on differen't levels so it depends on your level of concious awareness. the dreaming in color or not timetravel mentioned is very true. This will be my last post on this topic. I bought the machine. The machine worked only for astral projection. (no body to heal to test healing + don't need to time travel) No I don't use the machine. Haven't used it for almost a year! Learn to do it naturally. You will even feel better about yourself.

This message for mrnitro or infact anyone who can help me. I have been very interested in astral projection, and infact anything that other people might consider "bizzare" or implossible. I might as well state that i am 18 years old, and have been interested in this for well over 5 years. I am well into meditation, and i beleive in astral projection, and have infact attempted it. I had failed, i thought i was close many times, but i never achived that state that many talk about. I was thinking of purchasing HDR but really wanted to talk to mrnitro or anyone on the phone or online not on a forum, and i really hope you can answer to my call.
