I know this is not related to OBE but i wanted to ask what you know about this matter
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you belive such character will appear
<br>
<br>
If yes what kind of life the prohpesies say he will have before rising to power
<br>
<br>
When is he suppose to rise to power
<br>
<br>
For what purpose
<br>
<br>
And finally how old he should be say around 2012?
<br>
<br>
There must be some 'hard to find' prophesies and clues somewhere in Bible surely?

   We are guaranteed our religious rights in this country through the Bill of Rights and I intend to use them to the fullest extent of the law in conjunction with Freedom of Speech.  You have every right as well, but you don't have to think that your religion (it is a religion) is the only right one.  On these forums people can talk about their religion publicly and I would expect that to be without criticism.

I just want to say this:
<br>
<br>
The above thread is more or less a microcosm of the kind of idiotic things people say to eachother when religion comes up and it goes to show just how pigheaded and defensive (or offensive) otherwise intelligent, normal people become when certain ideologically charged words arise in conversation.

Thanks Nerezza i'll look into Daniel and Revelation texts

According to the Bible anti Christ should rise in 2009 which is the year marked as "rise of the beast".

What is his purpose to challenge Jesus the Christ at the second coming? or pretend to be him?

Im not an expert on end times thought, but this is what I know:
<br>
<br>
1) In order to buy things, we will need a mark, either on our foreheads or wrists. Apparently this is the mark of the antichrist.
<br>
<br>
2) The world will in such a screwed up state(brought on by man getting away from a spiritual life in favor of a material one) that people will welcome this man and I think he is supposed to perform miracles(i.e resurrection).
<br>
<br>
3) One world government/ religion(those seeking a more free path i.e. new age, will find that it will be very similar).
<br>
<br>
That's all I can remember now.

excuse me for being off topic, but a lot of the church of satan's beliefs are borrowed from other religions. the church just takes them and rewords them, makes them a little harsher. if you look at their texts, they're really a very selfish, unnaffectionate association of morons who are in it just for the 'bad' image associated with the church. imo anyway. youd have to be pretty far out not to consider them selfish at least. just read their nine statements, etc...

In reference to the Antichrist
<br>
<br>
I believe their are entities in the Spiritual realm, who once existed with God and the other Holy Angels in a particular kind of home in the Spritual realm, created by God.  One day some of these Angels got the idea that they could take over the place because the place was a peaceful place and non-warlike, where entities who were mostly peaceful in nature just enjoyed life.  Well anyway some of these Angels got the big-head thinking we can take over these meek fun loving entities up her.  They probably were even stupid enough to think they could take over God.
<br>
<br>
I believe these Angels made their moves, and war broke out suddenly, and the lines were drawn suddenly.  I believe the fallen angels (the ones who thought they could take over everything) we're kind of in shock when they saw and experienced that these other fun loving, Angels were actually capable of fighting not only at the same level of them but even possibly a higher level, because they generated their fighting power from love, not evil or ego.
<br>
<br>
In Summary the evil angels lost the battle, and retreated from trying to take over the heavens.  I feel that in their retreat while the battle was still raging a little bit, that they attacked mankind in a certain way and got mankind to sin, so that God with the Holy Angels had to find a way to redeem mankind back.  It was the fallen angels that started the things up in heaven, not mankind, and that is why God made a way for them back to him.
<br>
<br>
The evil angels who lost and have chosen not to repent or change their character is the Antichrist, and their leader in particluar is the antichrist.  The Spirit of that antichrist is going to find an ignorant stupid egotistical human somewhere in the world, and try to work it's evil through that person.
<br>
<br>
But in the end, however it turns out or plays out, evil will lose.

I get the jist of your post. IMO they keep finding these humans you describe and they do their best. Working their evil through people isn't that hard (for now). But are times not changing?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from the last line of your post it would appear we would both say yes to that.

Supposedly satan is the moron who thought he could make the world a *better* place. But of course he didn't, however for some reason he is in control of this planet and has been in control for the last .... hmmm about last 10 000 years.
<br>
<br>
Why?
<br>
<br>
POWER STRUCTURE
<br>
<br>
satan
<br>
-
<br>
9 metaphysical assistants
<br>
-
<br>
3rd party clans and priests
<br>
-
<br>
in house priests and illuminati primis
<br>
-
<br>
The rest of the gang, banks, politicians, security services etc
<br>
<br>
I recon "anti Christ" is his counter strike to the Christ. Like "God sent his Son and i will send mine".

The biggest question of all times
<br>
<br>
Do you know how much pain and torture is going on on this planet at ANY GIVEN MOMENT? And it has been going on for a really long time. And it's about to intensify in the nearest future.
<br>

The question is why God allows that to happen?

Supposedly they will be stopped after 2012 when most of life has been destroyed, but why not before?

"The question is why God allows that to happen?" - tyler
<br>
<br>
"That one makes me laugh every time" - roy
<br>
<br>
i can see where roy's coming from. it's amusing to me, too. when you look at such questions from an atheist's point of view, maybe you can understand why..
<br>
<br>
"yea, i would like to see you laugh, i would like to see you walking down a street when someone puts a bag over your head, shoves you in the trunk, then tortures and mutilates you for 50 day straight, keeping you alive on glucose life support, ripping out 1 organ at a time while shouting and chanting to satan.
<br>
<br>
Yeah i would really like to see you laugh"
<br>
<br>
so why would 'god' allow that to happen, tyler? he's supposively infinitely forgiving yet you seem to think these things take place, and i don't doubt they do. this alone would challenge a very basic concept of christian god: that he is infinitely loving and forgiving as well as all-powerful. now one of those statements is apparently not true. if he was infinitely loving he would save one of his followers from being tortured, right? unless he wasn't all-powerful.. and if he wasn't infinitely loving, he would have the opportunity to save the person, but would just choose not to. why? because the person wasn't 'holy' enough? . . .

What is God realy like? What is characteristic of God? Is God all-forgiving? Is God just? How can God be just and merciful at the same time? Do God forgive our wrong to Him (just for convenience... do you really believe God is male, or female, like us? Or really this only applies to us? What about amoeba?) This has been discussed for such a long time.. And surprisingly the answer are not any nearer to us...

It's a good thing I came across this thread!  Thank you Tyler for this valuable information!
<br>
<br>
Why have I changed my tune?  Three nights ago as I was casually walking home and I encountered a man.  He was tall, dark and dressed in an odd fasion.  He said 'Honor me, for I am the Falconer!', I replied with what I thought was a coy remark.  To my shock, he became enraged.  Never have I seen a man so red with hatred for another.  He attacked me, so quickly, so violently that I pondered whether he harnessed some other force.
<br>
<br>
As I lay there in my own crapulence, in a bloody mess of confusion, I cried.  He heard my cry, and responded with more anger and fear.  I was carried away, into a small building within a forest.  It had some odd markings around the building, my blood curled at the thought.  I tried to grasp what was going on, but my own survival took priority.  At this point, The Falconer sat me down in an old wooden chair.  In front of me was a desk and a knife.  I could not copprehend what was going on, or what was going to happen.  Yet soon enough, I did.  The Falconer removed my digets, finger by finger while chanting something in tongues.  It was at this point I realized my ignorance, my stupidity... he was a satanist.
<br>
<br>
At any rate, long story short I got home and typed this message with the remaing two fingers I have.

Tyler,
<br>
<br>
Here's another post that shows we have a very religious crowd here. Almost five hundred readings, but just a little over thirty replies.

The Antichrist isnt a person, its a consortium, a consortium of the leaders of the world, the leaders of banks and large corporations - the term 666 which is said to be the mark of the devil is in todays world in just about everybodys wallet or purse - the word VISA which is on your VISA card is in ancient numerals derived from I believe 2 civilisations is represented as the number 666. The mark we will recieve will be a chip in the top of the hand which will replace the bank card.

The antichrist thesis will be applied to any matching situation when the proper scenario arises. Oddly enough, I think mathematics would be great in explaining this.
