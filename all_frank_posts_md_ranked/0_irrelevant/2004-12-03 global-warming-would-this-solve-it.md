On Global Warming (Temporary Quick Fix)
<br>
<br>
It is known that white reflects light and heat. The north and south polls have lots of ice and snow. There is a hole in the ozone layer, the suns rays make it through into our atmosphere they carry heat with them this heat hits the ice, melts it and then is reflected back into the atmosphere and causes damage to the ozone layer.
<br>
If we take a look at earth using weather satellites the north and south polls sometimes appear as dark patches and an image is not registered this could be due to the heat being reflected upwards from the ice distorting the received image.
<br>
<br>
It is known that Mirrors eat light, wouldn't it seem logical to place giant specially designed light eating mirrors in the polls? So instead of light hitting the ice and being reflected into the Ozone the mirrors would eat the light instead?
<br>
<br>
Would this work???

<section>
Just some things that I noticed that seemed a bit unusual in your theory:
<br>
<br>
The sun rays dont carry heat, otherwise space would conceivably be warmer.
<br>
<br>
The snow and ice does not reflect heat back into the Ozone layer and damaging it. Carbon Dioxide release and recycling is the main contributor of greenhouse gases, which is where the real heat comes from. The heat is trapped inside the Earths atmosphere and creates a cycle where everything gets warmer.
<br>
<br>
Heat doesn't damage the Ozone layer, chemical pollution does. The outer layers react with ultraviolet radiation, which bonds the oxygen molecules together, which absorbs the "harmful" radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons (chlorine, carbon and fluoride compounds) break down the oxygen bonds, which is Ozone damage. Chlorofluorocarbons are commonly found in aerosol sprays, foams, refrigerants, etc.
<br>
<br>
White reflects light, black absorbs light (which then produces heat) and the colors are inbetween based on how much light is reflected. In your theory, a mirror would only do more damage, considering it REFLECTS more light than white snow.
<br>
<br>
But, thats not the case, as it would probably make the earth look very shiny from space.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for the information, however I wish to learn more. It is known that heat causes things to rise, why does smoke rise? With this information it would become apparent why chlorofluorocarbons are in the atmosphere in the first place.
<br>
<br>
"White reflects light, black absorbs light (which then produces heat) and the colours are inbetween based on how much light is reflected. In your theory, a mirror would only do more damage, considering it REFLECTS more light than white snow."
<br>
<br>
Now again I know "and so do many other smokers" that white reflects light! Even more then mirrors do, asks any green smoker and they'll tell you the same thing. You wont find one grower who uses a mirror to reflect light; this is because mirrors eat the precious light that is needed, this is why we see an image in a mirror when we look at it, because it absorbs the light (image) and we perceive the image that is absorbed via are own decoding light. So I am pretty sure that mirrors eat light, but they could reflect beams of light.
<br>
<br>
"The sun rays dont carry heat, otherwise space would conceivably be warmer."
<br>
<br>
The suns rays and heat come onto the earth because we are a giant reflective surface, whereas space is not. This is a sticky subject, but if you don't ask you don't know, please, how is it we have heat from the sun if the rays don't push/carry heat?
<br>
<br>
With the way I view light and mirrors it would seem logical to me that white snow would reflect the light, and this light would help carry all bad stuff up into the Ozone, note big holes in ozone above polls.
<br>
<br>
Please let me know what you think without trying to ridicule me.

Alright, first of all Logic is right. UV rays do NOT carry heat. Heat is caused when the atoms speed up. SINCE there is almost no particles in space, nothing is there to be sped up. There must be particles for heat.
<br>
<br>
Lol, so your a green smoker eh?

Hello again!
<br>
<br>
"Heat is caused when the atoms speed up. SINCE there are almost no particles in space, nothing is there to be sped up. There must be particles for heat."
<br>
<br>
Please let me get this right, according to earthly science, heat isn't there if there are no particles to speed up? So If I weren't made of atoms I could travel up close to the sun without any ill effect. However If I were made of atoms I would bring them with me and on my journey to the sun my atoms would be sped up and I would be burnt to asunder. Forgive me if my reasoning is wrong but according to our understanding, saying that there is no heat in space because there are no particles to speed up is the same as saying wind isn't there unless we can feel.
<br>
<br>
I think this thought experiment demonstrates that heat is always there, but can only manifest when an atom (Manifested Thought) is there to receive it or is this a misunderstanding?

BirdManKalki, you need a lot more knowledge to understand how these things work. you are on the right track though, because you are at least intersted

<br>
<br>
1) "The sun rays dont carry heat" - they do. double check your info please. plus the word "rays" sounds confusing here. you know that light is waves/particles, right?
<br>
<br>
2) "the colors are in between based on how much light is reflected" - no, not
<b>
 how much
</b>
, but rather
<b>
 what wavelength of
</b>
.
<br>
<br>
3) "UV rays do NOT carry heat" - they do. double check your info please. UV rays are photons as much as other photons. hence they have energy.

How has this been proved? How are you defining science? I always thought science had something to do with the words "to know" or something. We are considered condensed energy NOT lightwaves I thought

The last I heard about global warming was that it is now proven that people have caused it. The conclusion I draw from this is that some kind of un-doing is required and that blaming the sunlight will not address the cause of the problem.

Yes, it will require nanotechnology and a more advanced understanding of chemical processes at the molecular level to both reduce and ultimately stop all damage to the environment that we humans do.  We are finding ways to do things with less waste.  Nanotechnology (forms of molecule collectors and filters) will be required to clean up the damage we have already done.

Yes exactly.  The action of either matter or energy bombarding other matter causes an increase in kinetic energy which is heat.

That energy is not the heat itself though, until it acts upon matter.

<br>
<br>
Okay, heat is exactly that. Sun rays are not hot, or any other form of light. It's those "rays" that smash into other particles that forms heat. Heat is when you have both of those things working.
<br>
<br>
So how does a sun ray/any other kind of light ACTUALLY CARRY heat?(that would be funny if it could, with like a cute little backback packed up full of heat!) It can't, but it has the abillity to make heat. Please check your info.

Global warming is caused by more of the energy from the sun being trapped under a blanket of chemicals. The chemicals are going to get so thick that more of the light will no longer be able to get in to get trapped to contribute to that global warming. So we will have global cooling?

<br>
Naaa, the more chemicals, the more heat trapped whether on entry or exit, doesn't matter I dont think, our atmosphere circulates pretty much as a complete system when you get to a certain point.
<br>
<br>
I do have a question though. Does anyone know why IR is so much more capable of carrying heat than other wavelengths? What are the properties which are specific to that range frequencies???

We researched and debated global warming at school a while ago and found it's pretty much going back and forth between people that care for the Earth and the big corporations that are polluting, and there are decent arguments on both sides. I think it's obvious, however, that pollution is definitely
<i>
 aiding
</i>
the process, whether or not it is indeed a natural cycle (really hard to say if that's whats going on now, though it's the corporations' argument, but the Earth has apparently been warmed before according to archaeologists).
<br>
<br>
What's sad is that we can't really repair the ozone at this point and it will take an amazingly long time to heal itself, so even if pollution is cut down more than the Kyoto Protocol asks, we're still in bad shape for the future as the ozone will continue to wear away as long as there is any pollution to damage it. But of course, the countries that matter aren't really going for Kyoto so the process is just being sped up. Creative solutions, such as the mirrors in the poles (although they themselves wouldn't work), will probably be the best way to solve this. I'm willing to bet we'll be burning coal and oil full-on until there isn't anymore, or until our leaders are dealt with. They really don't care where the world will end up as long as they make lots of cash/remain powerful.
