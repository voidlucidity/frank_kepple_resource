I want to thank everyone for praying for me the last two years for my chronic hepatitis C.
<br>
<br>
I had another viral load done a month or so ago and it came back non-detectable.
<br>
<br>
I am continuing medication for awhile but I feel I am cured.
<br>
<br>
Life is changing in all ways for me right now.  And not just in regards to my ex-illness.  I don't know where I am going or how this will be AS MY LIFE CHANGES, but thanks for all the prayers and help.
<br>
<br>

I haven't been around, so I may have just not known you, but am I missing something?  Your join date shows november, 30 of 2004, which is a few days, not a few years.  Your first post ever is thanking us for praying for you.
<br>
<br>
Did you go under another nick or was another member here requesting help for you, or something?  Can someone else fill me in on what's going on?
