This is irrelevant, but does anyone know the story behind easter? Somehow, we celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ by saying a bunny rabbit hides eggs and candy overnight. The comedian Bill Hicks is the one who made me realize how rediculous that is. But maybe there's some story that I don't know about?

Easter is just way too commercial for me, much like all the other holidays. I was in Walgreens last night and could not even get down the candy lane. There were about 30 people all crammed in grabbing small bags of chocolate that cost $4-5 each. Although I am not a Christian, I much prefer the religious aspect of Easter to the commercial bunny-and-eggs side of it.
