Two IT blokes met in the park. One says to the other, "Where did you get such a great bike?"
<br>
<br>
The second IT bloke replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on it, she threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."
<br>
<br>
The second IT bloke nodded approvingly, "Good choice. The clothes probably wouldn't have fitted."

An IT bloke was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess".
<br>
<br>
He bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket.
<br>
<br>
The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week."
<br>
<br>
The IT bloke took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to the pocket.
<br>
<br>
The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you for a week and do ANYTHING you want."
<br>
<br>
Again the IT bloke took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket.
<br>
<br>
Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess and that I'll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?"
<br>
<br>
The IT bloke said, "Look I work in IT. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog - now that's cool."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nope, I'm not in IT.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Okay try this.
<br>
<br>
So there is a Mechanical Engineer, a Electrical Engineer, and a Software Engineer driving in a car. Â The car begins to knock and stutter like mad, so they pull off to the side of the road.
<br>
The Mechanical Engineer pipes up and says, "It's probably low on oil or gas, we should check all the fluids."
<br>
The Eletrical Engineer says, "No we should check the plugs, battery , and altinator, it's gotta be one of those."
<br>
The Software Engineer then replies with, "No, if we close all the windows, turn it off, wait 10-15 secs., and then turn it back on the problem should correct itself." [
