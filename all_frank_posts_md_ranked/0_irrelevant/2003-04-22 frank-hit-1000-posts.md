Ah, but does that then imply a guru/teacher status, or an overly opinionated chatterbox?

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I would like to add my congratulations to Frank on breezing through the 1000 post mark [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
] Not only that, but all of Franks posts are exceptional, and often very detailed, so not only is it 1000 posts, but 1000 valuable posts which many people benefit from. Thanks Frank!
<br>
<br>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank every member for your valued contributions. It was not long ago that I posted here about the first anniversary of the Astral Pulse forums, and hitting 25,000 posts at the time. Well here we are a couple of months on and over 32,000 posts in over 4,100 seperate topics by nearly 2000 members.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again everyone!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
I would like to add my congratulations as well. It has been only a relatively short while that I have been reading and writing posts here. However, in that time I have learned a great deal from Frank's posts. He has been kind enough to give some detailed instruction that has definitely helped in my astral studies.
<br>
<br>
As Adrian pointed out, it isn't so much the amount of posts
<u>
 but the content
</u>
of his posts that is so instructive.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

Frank,
<br>
I hope you're going to write many more posts on this forum. It's always a pleasure to read the detailed and almost always most informative comments you make.. [

Frank's over rated!  I mean come on!

Just kidding![

Frank knows how much I respect his ideas and contributions.  I may think some of his jokes suck, but other than that he is probably the most careful and thoughtful poster here, at least when it comes to consistent, helpful posts regarding OBE.
<br>
<br>
Congrats Frank!

<section>
Perhaps Adrian should introduce a new membership level (software permitting) -
<br>
The GURU member.
<br>
<br>
Gods know Frank has given me some very useable advice.
<br>
<br>
Then if that's possible maybe Adrian can introduce another new level - the CHATTERBOX member. Something for Timeless to aspire to. [

<u>
 Thank you
</u>
everyone for your kind comments. I'm no Guru, it's just that all the beginning stuff I've in many ways been there, seen it, done it. Because of that, I *know* how tricky it is.
<br>
<br>
But just keep pushing those (largely) self-imposed boundaries and they will give way, eventually. Okay, that may be not the quickest tactic in the world: but it works.
<br>
<br>
I do often wish I was born with some kind of talent for all this, but I wasn't. And so it seems neither were most people who attempt this sort of thing. So, in that respect, it feels good to be normal. And it is a pleasure to help people in the same boat (so to speak).
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
