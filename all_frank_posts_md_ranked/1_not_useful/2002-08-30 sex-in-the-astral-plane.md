Ok folks... let's be honest... Who has had sexual expriences during OBE's? I know I've had plenty, what I want to know is... Is this a dangerous thing?

I have yet to have full blown astral sex with anyone yet.  To date, I've simply felt up a few women as I flew next to them!  Of course, just that action got me so excited that I lost control of the experience and returned the physical.
<br>
<br>
Now when I am out, even though the sexual temptation is strong, I try to keep it under control and focus on other things.  This isn't to say that I don't desire a TRUE astral/sexual encounter, but I will know when the time is right.  There is something wrong about me flying up to random people and touching them!  Hehehe.

Article?? I had a look for it, but couldn't find...I'd be interested in having a look if someone could direct me to it..
<br>
<br>
Without going into TOO much graphic detail (hehe) ... I remember one time standing beneath this giant tree, and being slowly drawn up into the leaves by this group of wispy gentle beings in billowy white robes, like tree spirits or something. It was very beautiful, not sleazy at all.
<br>
<br>
But it is funny, I'm certain there are far more noble experiences to be had... but you know, you do it because you CAN.. definately a distraction though, I agree.
<br>
<br>
Some article I read somewhere on the net said that you should never fraternise with beings in the astral world, that it's like real life - in that it isn't safe to just go around bonking any old person you happen to meet... You never know what you're going to bring back with you (an astral stalker?..)
<br>
<br>
Ahh... but I don't know...

Jeff ...hee hee...

"To date, I've simply felt up a few women as I flew next to them! Of course, just that action got me so excited that I lost control of the experience and returned the physical. "
<br>
<br>
...I like the way you casually threw that in there ! You are the "astral groper".
<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I read somewhere that women can have astral sex, but men can't, as they become too excited and just wake out of it (as Jeff described)...Is this true ? If so - I feel a bit hard done by !

I havent been so lucky just yet!
<br>
<br>
I have been unfortunate enough to experience negitive sexual encounters while stuck in paraliss  though.Its not pleasant yet can start out that way untill I realise whats happening.
<br>
<br>
I once read a book that was titled "flying without a broom" and in it the lady whos name I cant recall said that astral sex was perfectly OKAY! She was getting it on a reagular basis!!  (:
<br>
She even talked about how her boyfriend who she loved dearly was no deterant as to her likings while O.B.
<br>
(was I ever happy to read that part! )
<br>
<br>
To date for me I have not seen anybody while actually O.B (lack of excperience I suppose)Its always inbetween and in my my bedroom.However, should I come across a seductive lady whos like,motioning for for me to like ,ya know,come on over,im going for it!
<br>
I`ll even tell my girlfriend about it.However I may start out with somethig like
<br>
" It was soooo increadible,it was you,right?"

I have recently finished reading (and rereading) an excellent book called Naked Soul - Astral Travel and Cosmic Relationships by Marlene Marie Druhan. The author is very insightful and open about the experiences she has had. She goes into great detail about exploring the possibilities of astral relationships. Beyond sex even is something she calls melding.
<br>
<br>
It would not do the book justice to attempt a summary but essentially astral sex can be a wonderful and very safe thing (with a few common cautions thrown in)
<br>
<br>
She has got a small web site. Like I said, it is the best book I have come across discussing cosmic relationships in great detail.

I have to agree that women probably have an easier time having astral sex than men, though I believe men can have it too. I have actually read more women having astral sex and men just loosing control. I think this is because men tend to get very excited about sex very quickly while women are not in such a rush thus staying in control. I like how the Toaist put it, men are like fire and women are like water. Men can heat up and burn out very quickly if they go too fast, while it takes women longer to heat up. If men can learn to control their sexual desires then they should be able to have astral sex just as easily. It, like other emotions and thoughts on the astral, require control in order to accomplish anything. I have not had astral sex yet but I see nothing wrong with it.

To find the astral sex article, go back to the main astral pulse site and click on articles-astral sex is the fourth one down.
