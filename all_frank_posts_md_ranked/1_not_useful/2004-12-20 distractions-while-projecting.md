Hi, I'm new here.  I am trying to have another conscious OBE.  I had one once where I woke up with vibrations and just floated out of my body.  I am using Robert Bruce's Rope technique and encountering some stumbling blocks.  First I meditate for about ten minutes into a light trance and then start climbing the rope.  My problem is that right when I start pulling on the rope my heart chakra starts beating VERY fast.  I know that you are supposed to ignore the sensations and focus on climbing but I am finding it very difficult to ignore this intense thumping feeling, it feels like my heart is going to explode.  So basically my question is, has anyone had a similar problem and found a way to overcome it and if so how did you do it? Thanks in advance.

Hello:
<br>
<br>
The sensations can be many and varied. Some people get hardly any, others are like yourself. After a while you get used to them and they won't bother you anymore.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Thanks for the reply.  I'll just keep at it, I think I am really close.

Getting into a deeper trance may help, it makes the body feel more distant

If you mean to ignore the sensations like "I mustn't think about it", then you're wrong. Focusing on ignoring them is still focusing on them. You must let them flow and get used to them so that they won't bother you.
<br>
<br>
Think of a horror movie. The solution isn't to turn off the TV, but to get used to the freaky images so that you won't be frightened anymore.
<br>
<br>
Also, this has to be trained, and to illustrate what I said, I'll quote Robert Bruce :

 Many people say they can't clear their mind as they are too easily distracted by all the small noises that surround them, in normal day to day activity. DON'T use music or other sounds to blanket these out, USE them for training. It's like weight lifting, if you train with feather dusters your strength will not increase. You need to master this, the hard way, if you want to give your mind real muscle.

Hote this helps.
