<section>
Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I am hearing consistent reports of excellent results from people who are using the "Brainwave Generator" software. BWGEN is free at its basic level, the site is here:
<br>
<br>
<b>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.bwgen.com/index.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.bwgen.com/index.htm
 </a>
</b>
<br>
<br>
The free software comes with a good selection of "pre-sets", and for a mdest l upgrade fee with a very large and ever expanding number or pre-sets - certainly many more than TMI can offer, and many are said to be superior!
<br>
<br>
The potential for BWGEN is unlimited, and provides an alternative to TMI almost for free, and with the ability to make and distribute our own brainwave entrainment WAV and MP3 files right here in the forums where we can discuss the benefits of each.
<br>
<br>
I have created sections in the file download Library for this purpose:

</a>
<br>
<br>
I look forward to hearing your comments and observations, and to seeing the WAV and MP3 files mounting up in the File library

<section>
Adrian,
<br>
<br>
You probably already know my opinions on Brainwave Generator from the other topic we have been discussing, but for the benefit of those who don't know here's what it's done for me...
<br>
<br>
I have only been using the program for six days now and already there have been major improvements in my attempts to project. The first three days of using it were just relaxing my body, but my mind was over active and I couldn't do alot. On day four, I found it was much easier to push surface thoughts from my mind and keep them away. This day I also achieved vibrations and my chakras burst in to life for the first time, especially my heart and brow chakra.
<br>
<br>
Yesterday (the fifth day) I managed to get the vibes again, this time without such a mad response from the chakras, but the same results all the same. As for today, i'm yet to practice, but I have found I can clear my mind and hold it for a good minute at the most before my brain bursts with thoughts. A minute is good for me, two seconds used to be mission impossible.
<br>
<br>
I also noted that yesterday I was able to relax quicker than the day before. I believe the effects of this are somewhat permanent as my mind is much easier to control, with or without the program.
<br>
<br>
All this is the result of using this program for just one hour daily, so I would recommend it. But for some reason, by using this program I seem to feel as if I am cheating or not earning my astral experiance. What are other peoples views on this?
<br>

Pointers from me? I've only been a member for two days! Thanks alot for the comment, I think that's what I needed to hear. I think the thought of me cheating might well have become a problem to my trying to project. Well i've been browsing the forums for a while now and picked up some good pointers, so with my fresh burst of enthusiasm i'm off to have another attempt. I'll let you know how it goes.

Yah,  Keep going!!!  It sounds like you are making some real progress!  Don't think of it as cheating at all, what ever works for each person is unique so if you respond  to brainwave Gererators then  keep at it.   As long as it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable of course.

<section>
I have was doing various tasks with it before my computer crashed a few months ago.
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the advantages that I found.
<br>
<br>
1.  Yes and Adrian stated it comes with a good variaty of pre-sets on the basic free version.
<br>
2.  The web sight maintains a large volume of add-ins for registered owners.  The volume of which is growing constantly because of the user submissions.
<br>
3.  One of the things I liked the most was the ability to copy the pre-sets to a .wav file for transfer to CD.  This giving you the ability to take them anywhere.
<br>
4.  There are several aspects of the program that can be tweeked.  If you know how to use and create various frequencies then you can easily custom tailor a beat/frequency pattern to suit your individual needs and/or responces to certain stimuly.
<br>
5.  When using the program on the computer there is no limite to the amount of time a pre-set can run.  If you want it to run for just 1 minute you can or you can run it for several hours.
<br>
<br>
I would reccomend the program for advanced users because of its adaptability and wide program options.  However for the basic users or those who do not know too much about frequencies and beat patterns I would not suggest it because it is too easy to create pre-sets that could be problematic.  I unfourtunately found this out with the triggering of a few "bad trips" as it were and I inadvertantly programed a 2 hour sleep cycle that took a month to break.
<br>
Basic users could vary easily stick to the free version of the program with no problems but should avoid any modifications.
<br>
<br>
Some of the problems I have with the program and its wide selection is that you do not know where some of the presets are comming from.  With this I mean that you can not be sure of the knowlage base that some of the people have that have made submissions to the web sight.  And although they may claim to have had positive results, thier pre-set is just that....Thiers.  And there for tuned to thier individual needs and thus not neccisarily good for the masses.
<br>
<br>
The only other problem I have with it is that over tweeking of certain pre-sets can make them unplayable and it is took easy to loose original presets.  But I guess you could always download them again.
<br>
<br>
That's my point of view on the subject.

<section>
Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
I amlocking this topic in place due to its significance.
<br>
<br>
I have been in touch with the OBE guru  on this one, and to my surprise they are not only heard of BWGEN, but consider it to be "way more powerful and flexible than any of the TMI stuff"!
<br>
<br>
Lets reconsider the TMI exchange topic. With this new knowledge, it seems much better and cheaper to discuss and exchange BWGEN pre-sets, rather than bother with all of that expensive TMI material.
<br>
<br>
I have created a File Library category for BWGEN pre-sets and complete sound tracks so members can start to share these. Those with CD burners can make their own audio CD's as well for themselves and others.
<br>
<br>
Lets go with this everyone!
<br>
<br>
I am excited by this not only because of the unlimited potential, but also because it is more or less free, and we can exchange pre-sets!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

"I am excited by this not only because of the unlimited potential, but also because it is more or less free, and we can exchange pre-sets!"
<br>
<br>
More or less.  It's $40 USD to register the program which is required to import ANY pre-set other than the ones that come with it.

Greetings Cainam!
<br>
<br>
I realise it is $40 to register the program. But that allows for unlimited pre-sets, each of which are the equivalent to TMI CD sets. Considering a TMI set costs $99 each of their own limited productions, I think we can say that $40, which allows for unlimited pre-sets and therefore potential, as well as the ability to crate our own, and share them for
<b>
 free
</b>
speaks for itself.
<br>
<br>
And of course we can make stand alone sound files to play through a PC and/or burn to a CD. All for free.
<br>
<br>
I don't regard BWGEN as commercialism in the same way that TMI is, but rather a valuable tool that could help alot of people in many ways.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

It's just that it took me 3 weeks to decide to spend the $40.  I guess in the end I am one of those people who wants every thing but doesn't want to pay for it.

HI,
<br>
I know that it has been some time since i have last posted anything, but i have been here and reading everything.
<br>
I just wanted to say that the one thing that bothers me about the brainwave generator is that the majority of presets have been made by people that don't know anything about the functions of the brain.
<br>
At least I can be sure with Hemi-Sync that i am not wasting my time or even causing myself harm.
<br>
However, i have decided to buy the pgm and try it.
<br>
Adrian, I would be glad to make an MP3 file consisting of one of the presets and upload it. this way not everyone would have to buy it (and the file would be much smaller that a wav)
<br>
I don't think it would be right to do this with the TMI cd's
<br>
<br>
let my know what you think...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
David

Greetings Astralmaster!

I agree with your comments.But as with everything, the proof of the pudding is in the eating

<br>
<br>
MartyD for example has objectively realised excellent results already with Deep Mind IV.
<br>
<br>
Also, many people here definitely do know what they are doing, and my main hope is that we can develop our own pre-sets and make them available in the download library in .WAV or .MP3 fomats.
<br>
<br>
There are loads of WAV to MP3 converters around for download.
<br>
<br>
It would be great if you could upload the MP3 to get the ball rolling! I have created the Libraries for pre-sets, WAV and MP3. I prefer MP3 in many ways, and of course those portable MP3 players are available as well.
<br>
<br>
We could make our own (better) Gateway series by overlaying voice on the BWGEN pre-sets! As Donna rightly said - "oh what fun"!

I should point out that some people to report feelings of sickness and dizzyness, as well as headaches. These reports come from the presets that people have made themselves. These reviews and all the home made presets can be found here:

Also, if you aren't sure about frequencies and there effects, here is a guide that you can use to help you make some, if you have a copy of the program:

I really like deepmind4, but the thunder is freaking annoying. I edited the preset and turned the thunder into shoveling sand or whatever that is. Every time the thunder would "roll" I'd be like AHHH its just too, dominante. If this were a multitrack project I'd say the volume on the thunder track needs to go down a little further.
<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned making our own set of gateway like experiences. To anyone interested multitrack recording software would make this pretty simple. I am a musician and have found a couple programs I really like. Cool edit pro
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.syntrillium.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

is great, but it costs a great deal. I beleive they still offer the older version for free, but it needs a plugin to mulititrack. And
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.n-track.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.n-track.com
</a>
is an amazing program for the price. You'd most likely need a full duplex sound card as well, but even a cheap sc these days is sufficient.
<br>
<br>
Or if no one has/wants to buy these programs I'd glady assist in the mixing and mastering to mp3 of such a project

How are you on voice overs - or anyone else local to you? We need to take the Gateway Wave 1 type theme and overlay it on a suitable BWGEN pre-set and turn it into an MP3.
<br>
<br>
I took a BWGEN pre-set and exported it to WAV, and it came to 212Mb for a 20 minute track!  I am removing WAV from the filre library because clearly it won't be practical - we need pre-sets and preferably MP3.

When I became mega relaxed I used that thunder sound to imagine there was a great surge of energy going through me, especially to my brow chakra. Eventually I saw like a white mist replace the black in my eyes and it felt like there was a really nice cool breeze blowing accross my forehead. Again, that was with deep mind vi.

<section>
Also, the thunder is there to keep you mind from wondering. If you listen really carefully, as the thunder roll comes to an end there's a little sound in there that sounds like a high pitched choir (I think that's how you spell it)singing in the distance. It's quite hard to hear, but if you concentrate really hard, and you have to to hear it, it can easily give you the required state of mind.

  I took a BWGEN pre-set and exported it to WAV, and it came to 212Mb for a 20 minute track!  I am removing WAV from the filre library because clearly it won't be practical - we need pre-sets and preferably MP3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks again.
  <br>
  <br>
  With best regards,

Sadly, I have a voice most wouldn't ifnd particuarly relaxing, which is a must. Its rather annoying in fact. Good thing I'm not a singer
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
Even if someone with a cheap computer mic could do something I can mix it up and track it perfectly. I have incredibly hi tech equipment, and can most likely clean up a dirty wav suffieciently. I'd be hesitant to loan by mail a 200$ mic
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
My line of thinking is that someone does a couple voice cuts, not in time to anything, just phrases strung together. I can then clean them up, and pull them apart, putting them whereever they need to go based on the bwgen file(s) being used.
<br>
<br>
For example, if a total track length is say an hour, its not going to contain much more than 10 minutes of anything vocal (just guessing here) Even as an incredibly high quality wav thats not all that much space. I can then encode everything into a high quality mp3. I would probably have to do something standard as well, as most soundcards can't play the highest quality I can produce.
<br>
<br>
So we need someone with a nice relaxing voice to volunteer a few minutes of their time

I can convert the presets in to wav files now. This is good for those who can't afford the software so they can listen to it by downloading it. Problem is the wav output files are 603mb big! Converting to mp3 won't do the trick, what we need is a WMA encoder, and a free one, coz they're expensive. I've been looking for a while and can't find any, but then i'm half asleep and finding it hard to concentrate on anything, especially typing.
<br>
<br>
If anyone knows where i can get a free wma encoder, or happens to see one listed on a web site, let me know, then I can start playing around with bitrates and audio qulaity and see if I can get it down to a decent size.
<br>
<br>
On that note, i'm off to sleep before I drop dead through lack of of it.

Hello to All !!!
<br>
<br>
I just recently got the BWGEN program so I probably cannot add to much to the conversation here.
<br>
<br>
However, BWGEN does have its own Yahoo group which I find very helpful in discovering new files.  It's free to join.  Here's the link:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bwgen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bwgen/
</a>
<br>
<br>
Besides the homepage for BWGEN their is also a user Files section in the Yahoo group as well.  Unfortunately there are no real ratings systems on the files to judge their effectiveness. Plus most files are composed by BWGEN users and may only be effective on the composers.  But maybe we could develop a ratings systems here at Astral Pulse on various BWGEN files?
<br>
<br>
There has been talk at the boards that there are some old BWGEN files which directly mimic the Gateway Experiences Focus level sounds as well.  You might me able to find them with a search on Google or a P2P shareware program like KazaaLite.  Please let us know if you're successful in doing so.
<br>
<br>
Thanks and regards,
<br>

<section>
I've been trying all day to get the file size down. It kills me to say... it just can't be done. I have tried every audio format available, with every different combination of bitrate and sample that can be done. The smallest I manged to get it down to was 10.7 megabytes, which is a good 30 - 50 minutes download on 56k modem, depending on your line etc.
<br>
<br>
But this was with poor sound and the rolling thunder noise sounds more like a small electric shock, and the frequencies themselves are a tiny bit muffled. The closest I could get to decent sounding file was a file sized 13.7 megabytes. Which leaves the issues of finding the space to upload it to, and would people actually bother downloading a 45 minute file that's gonna take just as long, if not longer to download, with reduced quality?
<br>
<br>
Why the output wave files are so big in the first place is beyond me. I had to generate a file that was an hour and a half long to get a 45 minute file (software limitations) and it was 1.2 gigabytes big, which must thier idea of a joke. The mp3 format is too big, but I might get musicmatch anyway to see if there is anything I can do with that. We really need a WAV to WMA encoder, a full version one at that.
<br>
<br>
Well, I ain't giving up, i'm sure there's a way that it can be done. Oh, and I did try zipping them up with winzip, but it makes no difference. Any bright ideas, point them in my direction.

think about this logically guys
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
theres no need for one huge mp3. Consider this, one small mp3  for each guided voice segment, and one small mp3 for each of the non voice parts. They download the several much smaller mp3's and toss them in a winamp playlist in order. Adding the non-vocal clips several times to get the desired length. Even with the highest quality mp3 format thats brings it down way under the 10meg mark.
<br>
<br>
It could even be done that way with better quality wavs, reducing the total download time for a very high quality "set" by half or more.
<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts...

<br>

<section>
Yep, thought of that one. I wouldn't know if you had the bwgen program, but if you have, you may have noticed when you create the wav file, all you get is one huge file. There is no way of exporting everything differently, and there's no other way of putting it on to cd. Plus you can't segment an audio file in to smaller peices once it's created. if you can, i can't afford the software to do it.
<br>
<br>
It wouldn't work anyway coz the whole point of it is so that it takes your brain frequencies from 14.1hz to 3.5hz, over a stretch of 45 minutes. You'd end up cutting and pasting the same thing over, or the same thing you would have had if you'd downloaded the whole file in the first place.
<br>
<br>
But it don't matter, I think I might have cracked it anyway. I can convert a 660mb wav file to a 30mb mp3. I can then convert that mp3 into a wma file, which will make it about 9.5mb, roughly. If not there's another format I can use.
<br>
<br>
Basically, we should have it cracked by tomorrow night, my time. Then with any luck I can get a file up for people to download and use. With any luck.
<br>

JUst to let you know: i tried to upload a 50.4mb file consisting of the Deep Mind IV preset encoded at 160kps, but the server cut me off almost at the end.

The only way i will be able to transfer the file is if adrian opens some sort of FTP account, so the we can upload big files.

Greetings Astralmaster!
<br>
<br>
Apologies for that - the max file size was well below the size of your file - it didn't occur to me to alter it.
<br>
<br>
I have set it to 100Mb now if you want to try it again.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise - the next major update of the software (soon hopefully) should have a better upload engine, or, I could setup an anonymous FTP.  I prfer the file library though, because all the info is included,and it is point and click.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your efforts!

I made this point before but maybe you can check it out... Since I don't have a Original version can you compare the original of Deep IV too the 160kbps version you made and see if it has the same effects as the lower bit rate copy im curious to know if the lower bit rate compromises the effectiveness of the bwgen wave.

I am going to program my own which lasts 40 mins and takes me slowly from 15 to 4 hz and see what the results are and post them on here!

i tried with 2. one i got sent by email, cant remember who sent it though. Although equally successful was the deep meditation 2 (deep) which starts at 14 hz and goes down to four over a period of 20 minutes. perhaps if you stretch or do some exercise before listening to the tape it will be even more effective and just as quick? i will try that next.

Im posting a link to the file and to sqr softs crossfading plugin for winamp (fixes the gap between songs).Good luck to everyone who tries it. Enjoy

Hey everyone.....I accidently posted my message (TWICE!) in the general astral consciousness forum and not in this specific thread. Yeah...I do feel pretty stupid.
<br>
Just thought I'd let everyone know that there is a basic way of using a preset that doesn't come with the BWGEN program. If you download Deepmind4, you could use it with the trial version of BWGEN without having to buy it.
<br>
If you look in the BWGEN folder, there will be a file called Presets. This is all the standard BWGEN presets that come with the trial version. If you then download Deepmind, you can move the Presets file out of that folder and put the Deepmind preset in the BWGEN folder and rename it to Presets. This now runs only Deepmind.
<br>
If you want to use the other presets, you then have to rename Deepmind back and put the old Presets file back into the folder.
<br>
Hope this is of some help to those that want to try the Deepmind preset and can't afford to buy the full version BWGEN.
<br>
Good Luck...

[|)] I don't think I can benifit from using BWGEN on my computer because of the on-board sound card. It picks up all the high-pitched static that my computer makes whilst running. I've found that the computer static makes it hard/impossible to use many of the BWGEN presets, especially ones with lower frequencies. I guess I should have either gotten a computer with a decent soundcard or headphones that block out computer static. Buying new hardware to use BWGEN isn't my ideal fix. Hmm. I'm wondering if there's any way to shut up the computer static whilst running BWGEN and not using my computer for any other jobs. Any ideas? [|)]

Hello everone,
<br>
<br>
I just got the full version of Brainwave Generator 3.1.9.
<br>
What I would like to know is: Could those of you who have had ANY success with a preset give us on the board a recommandation or upload it to the File Library, with the effect it had?
<br>
It would be highly appreciated!
<br>
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
<br>

I downloaded the 30 day trial of BrainWave generator last thursday. I used it for about 23 minutes thursday night, skipped friday night, used it for 21 minutes saturday evening, and another 25 minutes sunday evening. I've just been using the Meditation 2 (deep) preset that comes with the trial version.
<br>
<br>
Occurances thus far:
<br>
<br>
Physical sensation - I noticed the first night, and each respective time using it, that I could feel a tightness/pressure in my forehead. I do meditate regularly and this is different from the feeling of my 6th chakra that I am used to getting. The feeling is similar, but the location is different. This tightness/pressure feels like its not on my forehead, but rather just inside and behind my 3rd eye, if that makes sense. But it wasn't uncomfortable at all. It was also interesting that when I went to meditate friday evening, even though I hadn't used the BWGEN that night, I immediately got that same sensation. Also felt tired and ready for bed each time.
<br>
<br>
Sleep affects - I had been on a dry spell with lucidity for awhile (almost 2 months). I had a lucid dream friday evening, and two more saturday evening. Also, my dreams have had some new, strange sensations and experiences within them. Not sure if this is a result, or simply coincidences.
<br>
<br>
Meditation/phasing affects - I hadn't tried phasing up till now. However last night I decided to try phasing instead of meditating. I sat in my normal meditation position (half lotus). During meditation, I often times get the random images that I've seen described by Frank and others when they phase. So I decided to start by meditating and then try the techniques they've described for proceeding to phasing.
<br>
<br>
The images started to come and I let them rise and fade as always, but I was more attentive of what they were instead of ignoring them, as I usually do when meditating. I was looking for the images that I've read about in which you 'step' into them to enter the astral. I don't recall ever seeing those before. Then in the one image, a person turned towards me and had something like a View-Master held to their face. But the View-Master ended up being a rectangle and several vividly detailed, full-color images flashed like a slide show in front of me. But they went by so fast I couldn't respond. There were only about 4-5 of them in a matter of 2-3 seconds. But I got excited that I finally saw what others have described.
<br>
<br>
I continued to watch a while longer but didn't see anymore of those type of images occur. So I called it a night. I'm curious if there are others 'steps' into the astral with this technique, other than stepping through an image. I think I remember that you can set an intent to go somewhere. I may try that next.
<br>
<br>
Not sure how much, if anything, that I've experienced is directly related to the sofrware, but I wanted to share what I've been experiencing. Hope someone finds it useful.

Hi
<br>
<br>
I'm new here, but thought I might be able to help with the distribution of the BWGen Gateway series that you guys mentioned trying out earlier on in this thread.
<br>
<br>
If Syntrillium does still offer a free version of cool edit that you can get a multitrack patch for, you could distribute the bwgen preset in it's normal format (.bwg), the voice-overs in individual MP3 files, and the cool edit session file with the locations of all the voices (.ses).
<br>
<br>
So the person downloading would get the bwgen preset and save it to .wav, then open up the cool edit session (that contains the locations for the voice-over mp3's) and chuck that bwgen wav file on a track and that's it.  This isn't a VERY easy way to distribute these files but it's not too bad and with a decent readme file it'd be okay.  Also, the download size would only depend on the size of the MP3's for the voice, and I don't imagine that'll exceed 10 minutes of voice and so it should be less than 5Mb all up in perfect quality (64Kbit mono should be plenty for the voice).
<br>
<br>
If you decide to do this, I think you should provide a download of cool edit and the multitrack patch on this site, and people could just download a ZIP package containing the bwg, ses and mp3 files.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  Ciao for now.

 Could someone who knows how to make presets please make me one that uses the frequencies 120-500?  Those are for telekinesis.
 <br>
 <br>
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.lunarsight.com/freq.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

 </a>
 <br>
 <br>
 You can find the list of frequencies there.  I have been searching and searching for one that uses those frequencies.  I looked on the bwgen website and all of their files arent in the format I want.  All I have seen people use is the 7.0 frequency but that is not working out right.  That frequecy is also or Astral Projection and I dont want that to happen while I am trying TK.  Also, instead of sending it to me in bwgen format, could you send it to me in wav format?  I cant use it while in bwgen format because my program comes up with something called error 10 and I have tried reinstalling it but it still happens.
 <br>
 <br>
 I'm wanting to burn it to a CD.

Hi, I have an unregistered version of bwgen and I can use it with no problems (limited of course) I have no knowledge of the brain waves or how these sounds affect the brain. But I was wondering what if I try to create a sound myself but going into very low or very high HZ like a sound that would go from 8Hz to 70 Hz in just 2 minutes. Will this be really dangerous. I tried going from 16 to 4Hz in just one minute and listened to it and it felt really weird like everything started fading and blurring so I forced myself to stop it. What do you think?

<section>
Danger by using it?
<br>
Answer: No
<br>
Exception: Having the volume too high so you damage your ears
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Try creating one preset that starts from 10-12Hz and moves down to 7Hz in 5min in s straight line and add some white noise to it aswell.
<br>
<br>
Try to watch for some effects in your mind, comfortable feelings or whatever.
<br>
<br>
Then look on how much time has passed and scan to see at what Hz you get that feeling.
<br>
<br>
Then create a preset that runs from 10-12Hz down to that Hz in 5min and let it run on that cool freq. for 5min and see what happends.
<br>
<br>
Thats for starters.
<br>
<br>
For me 10.1Hz gives me VERY comfortable feelings in my whole body.

Adrian.  Has anyone reported the availability of voice over pc software that would allow what is being suggested in this posting and, if so, would you be good enough to provide some direction on where to go to get this software.  I am considering the installation of a CD/DVD Burner in my PC and would like to experiment with voice over functionality with BWGen presets.    Regards,  hannerl

  Greetings Social!
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks very much indeed for the great offer!
  <br>
  <br>
  How are you on voice overs - or anyone else local to you? We need to take the Gateway Wave 1 type theme and overlay it on a suitable BWGEN pre-set and turn it into an MP3.
  <br>
  <br>
  I took a BWGEN pre-set and exported it to WAV, and it came to 212Mb for a 20 minute track!  I am removing WAV from the filre library because clearly it won't be practical - we need pre-sets and preferably MP3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks again.
  <br>
  <br>
  With best regards,
  <br>
  <br>
   Adrian.

Do you use BWGen at low, moderate or high volume?
<br>
<br>
I used a rather moderate volume last night but got startled every time a new tone began...I think a will try a lower volume this night.
