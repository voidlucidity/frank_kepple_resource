<section>
Hi everyone! I am new to this forum. For some time now I have been interested in Astral Projection. I have tried many different techniques, read quite a few books, Monroe, Bruce, Buhlman, Moen and Taylor to name but a few, swamped myself with information on this subject. I suffered from the usual problems of getting to the vibrational state. After overcoming all the irritants, and eventually achieving the vibrational state, then for whatever reason fear took over, until one morning after a good night's sleep I found myself up at the ceiling at the furthest corner from my bed looking down at the bed with me in it. I couldn't believe it. Although everything looked the same, it was slightly different; it was like looking through binoculars the wrong way because everything looked somewhat smaller. I remember trying to work this out, and instantly I was back in bed. This was so completely different from any dream or lucid dream.
<br>
<br>
On another occasion, I awoke to complete blackness; now my bedroom is never in complete darkness because I keep the curtains open at night, as I have always done, also there are lights outside the house. I got such a shock at being surrounded by this blackness that I shot in to a sitting position, blinked my eyes open and closed a few times hoping the pitch black would disappear because it was scary, (if only I had read Robert Buhlman's book at this point because he explained that if this happened it is called astral blindness, and one should say "clarity now") so I lay back down, kept my eyes closed for what seemed like ages, then slowly opened them to find the room as it should be, where I could see everything because of the curtains being open. I have had a few more experiences but up to this point never seem to get out of my room. From my own very limited experiences, it seems to me that conquering fear is the most important aspect of astral projection. Here in this reality it is easy to say, "I am not going to be scared," this is on a surface level, but in the astral, as you think it - and so it is - instantly! It's impossible to pretend you are not scared. From my perspective, I think that it is important to say an affirmation for protection, (Monroe's works for me) also to imagine being cocooned in white or golden light. Because thoughts in the astral are instantaneous, Whatever we encounter that is negative, feeds on our fears, so if we are prepared prior to entering the astral state, to being in a positive frame of mind, knowing that we can conjure up anything from our imagination to help whatever scares us. Although I have been reading and practicing for some time now, I realize that I am just a beginner to all of this and have a lot to learn, but I hope that with practice and determination I will be able to project out of my bedroom.
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,
<br>

  Thank you for your warm welcome and your help with the selected posts to read. I must admit that it took some time for me to post my message as this subject is not something that I have talked about with anyone else, so even though this is not face to face, I still feel self conscious, silly isn't it! Anyway I do look forward to participating.

   Everybody has to conquer their fear barrier.  I can only ever try for an OBE during daylight hours, good advice from Robert Bruce, for some reason I feel I can face just about anything during daylight hours...  And that's just making an attempt - I'm very new to this, I haven't got past the vibration stage yet.
   <br>
   <br>
   Good luck on getting past your room.

Greetings Barbara, and welcome to this "astral community", it´s a great place with lots of great people sharing the interrest of astral projection and the likes...    as for having a bit trouble leaving your room and occasionally being blinded when out of body, I´ve learned it can be very difficult with moving as well as sight when you are within a range of 4-8 metres of your physical body.
<br>
So the pitch black darkness you´ve experienced could be caused by just that, being to close to your body..
<br>
<br>
Take care// Qui-Gon

 Welcome to the forum.
 <br>
 <br>
 You need to check your emotions at all times. The most beneficial state of mind to have is a feeling of mild curiosity. What you are going through is what all Astral travellers have faced at some point. Fear is a very strong barrier. Something which I know only too well.
 <br>
 <br>
 You do need to be aware, though, there is a base area of the Astral that I have termed the training ground or training zone. I posted something about this in my answers to another thread.
 <br>
 <br>
 Despite everything, the Astral proper is quite a "stable" environment. I never came across any Demons or anything. Well, not when I have been truly on the Astral in what I term the discovery or learning zone. I do have what I call "scary moments" but that is only because I am seeing events that are so totally alien to me that my mind naturally gets a little concerned.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you are projecting and find yourself having to fend off Demons or such like, it is 100% certain you are in the training zone.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the training zone, circumstances are not so much a case of, as you say, "Whatever we encounter that is negative, feeds on our fears" It is more a case of, "Whatever we fear causes us to encounter that which is negative."
 <br>
 <br>
 Likewise, the exact opposite can occur or any other situation inbetween. I often read of people's experiences and, by the nature of the experience, it smacks to me of a training zone experience rather than the Astral proper.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

Welcome Barbara,
<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are doing great.  It is not easy to retain conscious awareness of OBE's.  I really look forward to hearing about your adventures.  I hope you can bring back more contiguous and complete memories than I.
<br>
<br>
I think we all do them much more than we think.  Often I will wake in the middle of the night and have a very brief memory but usually am so tired (and my daughter always takes the pens I put on my table...often I think I will have to tape on to my forhead but likely would not sleep well then) and  so it almost always goes forgotten except for little pieces here and there.
<br>
<br>
I really agree with you about Robert's book.  He did do an excellent job.  I have listened to many people discuss astral travel before but never purchased any books on the topic.  However after I listened to Robert on Art Bell for the first time in my life I was really interested because he described things that had been happening to me that no one else had ever come close to. I have recommended him to my cousin who is really gifted in her ability to OBE.
<br>
<br>
Best Regards,
<br>

Thank you for the welcoming replies to my 1st message on this forum. The advice will go a long way to helping me in my pursuit of successful astral projection.
<br>
<br>
Frank regarding what you say about the training zone, this being the base area of the astral where by "whatever we fear causes us to encounter that which is negative"
<br>
Sounds completely logical to me, being aware of this and more importantly believing it, will on a subconscious level help me with whatever I encounter. I do realize that emotions and a positive frame of mind are all important. I will look for your other messages to find the thread that you mentioned.
<br>
<br>
I have found when meditating within the hypnagogic imagery,there always appears a small white dot that grows in size becoming an empty circle within a circle changing in colour with each circle becoming bigger. When the circle has become full screen size  (which is situated in the area where the third eye is) it is like watching a television screen, I have seen some strange and wonderful places, what appears to be like the Moon, another like Mars. A place that has three Moons, where everything was the colour of pink and lilac with a strage rock like terrain. Seen structures that I just couldn't give a name to because I have never seen anything like this before. I have viewed the earth from afar, been in the ocean and seen a large round submersible with a window, with what appeared to be faces looking at me watching them, this and so much more, but I found that if I tried to concentrate or think about what I was observing and not remain passive then it would all instantly be gone.
<br>
<br>
I don't know if others have experienced this, but since becoming involved with all of this it feels as though my intuition is stronger, and I have become more 'sensitive'.

 You are almost certainly viewing the Astral.
 <br>
 <br>
 I suggest you try and project into the Astral by imagining your awareness shrinking down to such a small size, that you can pass straight through the image, and into the world you are viewing at that time. There is an excellent chance that would work - it is the basis of several projection techniques. Some people create doorways in their solar plexus or heart chakras,  and project straight through them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Remember - your consciousness or awareness is an *extremely* small point of energy.
 <br>
 <br>
 Some advanced projectors project through symbols that represent different realms, and others create more advanced symbols, which mean something more specific, and project through them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Sounds to me that you are tuned into the Astral, you just need to get there

Thank you Adrian!
<br>
<br>
It's funny that you should mention a doorway because a few weeks ago I was suddenly awakened one night, and being half awake/asleep remembered this. In my dream state I was standing at a doorway that was closed. Standing beside me were three people who were telling me what to do to open and go through the door. Now this did seem strange to me, being told how to do this. At the time, I thought  "it's just a dream" Now in retrospect after reading your advice, I can see that the door was symbolic and I missed the point of it.
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the advice, and will see how this works for me.

Dear Adrian,
<br>
<br>
I was curious about your comments.
<br>
<br>
I think that their are OBEers that are really good a some forms of OBE than others.  For example my cousin has just 'way to eiry' an ability to project herself to almost any location on the planet.  Her husband was an airplane pilot so she liked keeping tabs on him.  She would project and watch him.  When he would phone she would say "Oh! you are at such and such an airport now due to this diversion".  But she would never tell him how she knew.  I am very poor at this type of projection.
<br>
<br>
I think that not only which chakra you project out of but your very belief systems and perceptions, goals and ways of interperting things dramatically impacts how we experience leaving our bodies and how we experience portals. My goal when OBEing is to learn perspective, compassion stuff like that.  I think that is why when I project I hear the phrases I do "What is your goal", "What do you wish to learn" etc once I leave my body.
<br>
<br>
Love and Light to the One and All,

 Yes indeed - your comments are very true of the Astral experience itself, in as much that it can be highly subjective, and shaped according to expectations, objectives even thoughts etc.. It is possible, with the right training, to move the experience from being less subjective, to more objective.
 <br>
 <br>
 However - the Astral can also be *highly* symbolic, in that you can project to realms that correspond with symbolism - e.g. a Carved Pumpkin might be the Sun realm, Silver Apple might be Avalon, Iron Cauldron the Moon realm etc.. Once you have arrived at that realm through these symbolic gateways, how you interpret what you find there, is then a matter of subjectivity/objectivity.
 <br>
 <br>
 Projecting though Chakras is more generic I guess - it is a gateway to the Astral - although I am sure the Chakra has some influence over the Astral realm you arrive in.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another method is to stare intently at a symbol of a certain colour, sometimes called Tattwas (I think), and then close your eyes. The symbol in the colour complimentary to the actual colour will be seen in your mind, and you can then project through that symbol. I believe that will take you to elemental worlds, but I am not exactly certain.

Hi Barbara,just adding something to Adrians post.
<br>
The Astral doorways using the Elemental Tattva symbols;
<br>
Ether/Black or indigo/oval
<br>
Fire/Red/triangle
<br>
Air/Blue/circle
<br>
Water/Silver/cresent
<br>
Earth/Yellow/square
<br>
<br>
Colour on one side,white on the back of the card/symbol.Like Adrian
<br>
said,you look at one colour,then reverse the card &amp; see the symbol
<br>
on a white background &amp; your mind will see the complimentary colour.
<br>
At this point as stated before is supposed to be a doorway to the
<br>
 Elemental Astral plane.
 <br>
 While I have not got around to trying this method myself,I will soon
 <br>
 try it out &amp; post my results if anyone hasn't allready done it.
 <br>

Dear Mobius,
<br>
<br>
That is fascinating about square and earth.  When I sent symbol images for Adrian to put in a form to post I called the square (common).  It is the one symbol I see over and over.  I do a lot of prayers for Mother Earth and feel very connected to her.

Many Thanks,

Hello Violet!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your words of welcome. They are appreciated.
<br>
<br>
I do agree with you in that as we are all different from each other then we will have somewhat different experiences. I have also felt so many times upon wakening that I have come back from somewhere.
<br>
<br>
Regarding meditation. I find that when I feel in a cheerful and happy frame of mind prior to meditating, which is like feeling 'AT ONE WITH ALL AND EVERYTHING' (sounds soppy-I know!) Then I find that I just sit or lie back with my eyes closed, and it is as though I am watching a video, but if I am in the slightest stressed out or anything along those lines then nothing works. So from my perspective, frame of mind is all-important.
<br>
<br>
All good wishes,
<br>
Barbara

encourage it's use over other methods,I just thought that you seem to
<br>
be pretty clicked on with using doorways,even if you don't think
<br>
you have been through them.
<br>
So I hope I didn't give the impression that I somehow favour it's
<br>
use.Oh no I,ve got to stop,I,m starting to sound like a disclaimer.
<br>
<br>
Everybody lies,but it doesn't matter, since no one listens.
<br>
<br>
Good journeys Barbara
