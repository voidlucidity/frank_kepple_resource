<section>
I've been unable to sleep so I've read a lot recently.
<br>
So can someone pleae explain to me why sex and spirituality are almost always considered mutually exclusive!!!!!
<br>
What is the big G** d**m deal!
<br>
I can see how the highly energetic state of sexual arousal can be mistaken for an amplified spritual state. But if one can make the distinction between the physical and the spiritual the point becomes pretty much moot, huh?
<br>
I'm ranting a bit here, but I've just about had it with the sexual fixtation of the spiritual community. Enlighten me someone, or saving that tell me to shut up

Taoism has methods of using sexual energy to increase the health of the whole body and to increase the energy of the chakras. It also warns that men lose sexual energy (as well as many nutrients such as zinc) and that all the organs of the body can be depleted to make up for the loss. For women it is still possible to lose energy in sex, but it is not the same as with men. Women are advised to cultivate their sexual energy anyway because doing so can be very helpful. The problem is that spiritual efforts also strengthen the body, including the sexuality, and if there are problems based around sexuality then those problems are enhanced as well. Rather than dealing with sexuality it is typical to try to suppress it and then it gets ugly. That is used to justify the suppression. It is best to use or transform the sexual energy.

I've always thought that there is energy and that it's manifested in various ways one being the sexual.
<br>
What's always wigged me out in the general spiritual teachings is the way in which various aspects of human nature are considered bad/dangerous/detrimental/
<you pick="">
 .
 <br>
 It's obvious at least to me, that in order to advance spiritually one needs to acknowledge all aspects of being a physical human and to incorporate them into the path.
 <br>
 When any part of the physical existence is neglected or suppressed we get all kinds of problems the least of which are the ones related to kundalini.
 <br>
 The life force or the essence of our being is inherently balanced and to try to accommodate it in an un balanced physical body is to ask for trouble. So I can't for the life of me understand why so many teachings fail to see that a balance is required kin the physical in order to have on one hand balance on the spiritual and on another change and advance.
 <br>
 The life force (kundalini?) is depicted as being a twofold energy, yin and yang, Ida and Pingala. Balance people, balance and harmony!

In some Buddhist meditation texts, I have read that people with defective (or missing) genitals cannot enter into the full first jhana. Not enough energy, somehow. With regular practice, most people can get there in six months to a year.

I agree, balance is very important. I am not sure why people feel the need to suppress parts of who they are, especially sex. To make sex seem like something that is bad or unimportant is extremely harmful in my opinion. Sex plays a major part of our lives. Maybe this separation of spirituality and sex is why so many people seem to find their sex and love lives either unimportant or unfullfiled. When I brought the two together I finally felt complete. Learning about Taoism has really helped. Now if I could only find someone who shares my views.

<br>
Actually, I have a sneaking suspicion that this is why "modern" religion and spirituality reject the sex/spirit combination: The split is an over-reaction to the Religions of Old.  They were too pagan, too earthy, too sensuous.  The Old Gods, and all their traditions, needed to be demonized in favor of the New God, whose Priests and follwers needed to be pure and sexless, to differentiate themselves from the old ones.  Bleah!
<br>
<br>
For good reading material on the connections between sex and spirit, Time-Life's Living Wisdom Series put out a book, titled appropriately,
<u>
 Sex and Spirit
</u>
.  It's about how sex and religion are connected . . . in fact, how ideas about sex defined religion. Complete with illustrations.  Check it out!

<section>
Seems most people here have a pretty balanced wholistic view towards sexuality and spirituality. This is good.
<br>
<br>
A properly balanced energy system should result in normal healthy sexuality, as the Sacral chakra (responsible for most of our sexuality &amp; sexual energy)will be properly balanced with the rest of the chakras.
<br>
<br>
For those of us that might have a more overactive libido, through awareness of your energy system, you can transfer energy from the sacral chakra to the higher energy centres, and gain benifit from that energy if you are unable to have your sexual energy expended in more "pleasurable" ways.
<br>
<br>
The flip side of this is that if you try and repress your sexual energy, as is demanded of most orthordox priests, it can throw your sacral chakra so far out of whack it can badly affect your sexuality, sexual energy, and physically affect the lower abdominal organs.
<br>
<br>
With this in mind it really is no wonder why there are so many reports of sexual abuse and paedophilia among orders of church clergy.
<br>
As Jouni pointed out, there is a real fixation among certain religious doctrines that the needs of the body should be put second to the needs of the spirit. Depending on how this is preached, and how people follow this philosophy, it can really screw up the bodies physical/energy balance, and lead to far more problems than just sexuality.

I totally missed that unintentional pun in the topic. Djinn and tonic can work against one's procreative interest if taken too far

Yep. Sounds human to go from one POV to a diametrically opposed one without passing through the middle ground.
<br>
<br>
I don't really believe one can lose energy when doing something that is in alignment with our natural needs. I'd think that energy is expended more when trying to fight what's natural.

I think it all depends on what you're trying to do.  In regards to psi, sex raises your energy levels, because of all that nervous system activity--it certainly isn't conducive to concentration on anything else, though.
<g>
 You could take advantage of the boost, as the energy will take a while to dissipate afterward.
 <br>
 For life-energy working, it's an entirely different ball of wax.
 <br>
 <br>
 I don't think I can believe that males will have negative health effects from sex.  If they don't engage in sex, they're going to have nocturnal emissions anyhow--that's what nature intended.  The endorphins and the physical contact should be more than enough to make up for the minor physical/energetic losses.  We know that touching and pleasure improve health.
