In  AD Robert Bruce talks about unconcious obe's where a person floats about 6 feet over their body. Has anyone become aware of doing this? I thought that this happened to me last night, because i remember vague exit sensations but it seems  like I experienced lucid dreams afterward. I thought of this because my recent obe experiences have been mostly of going out of my body and not having any energy to move. Maybe last night i did the same but switched to dream mode and never really 'traveled' anywhere, but still was lucid. Anyway it was interesting because i was in a dark place and asked for light and found myself in a meadow. The other  segment i was in a large conservatory type room and found out that i could multply the ceiling fans by concentrating on them. Maybe this place is what Frank referd to as the "astral training ground'? Comments anyone?

I have never been aware of floating over my body like that.
<br>
<br>
I do find that the more I try to project, the less energy I have in reserves and the less impact an experience is likely to have. It sounds like you see something similar. Despite the lesser impact, I am trying ot project frequently, thinking that the more you use the system, the more energy you start to carry as a baseline.

Wish I could be of more help -

I know this to be true and I have caught myself doing it on occasion. With me it seems about 2 feet but I guess the exact height would vary from person to person.

I remember an experience I had awhile ago. I seemed to peacefully exit my body (there was no vibrations or rapid heart beat sensation). I was just floating around 1 foot above my body. I then felt myself peacefully drifting into a large cupboard next to my bed. Throughout this I always felt that somebody was standing next to my body and maybe rubbing my head (don't ask me why but this is just what I thought at the time
