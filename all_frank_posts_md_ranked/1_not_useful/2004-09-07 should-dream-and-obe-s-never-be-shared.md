I read on MysticWeb that dreams and OBE's are private things that should never be shared with anyone or you won't get them anymore...
<br>
<br>
Is this true?

Hi,
<br>
<br>
Personally I think whether one shares their OBEs is a matter of personal choice and responsibility and not something to be dictated by another party about. I have had them since writing about them so why should anyone else not?

My two pence worth,

<section>
heya,
<br>
<br>
i agree with EOL007. Just be careful with who you tell OBEs to because i know some of my friends think im insane while others want to hear everything i know about them. As for dreams, i usually only tell people if their really strange or funny, or if im having trouble interpreting them. Getting others opinions can be nice and helpful except since their not you it might not always be the correct interpretation...also, ive told many people about my dreams and OBEs and i stll get them, so no thats not true [

Do you really think enlightenment works that way?
<br>
<br>
Granted, only you can interpret the symbols in your dreams (they are your dreams after all), because everyone attaches different meanings to different symbols.
<br>
<br>
Part of enlightenment is enlightening others.  For what purpose is enlightenment, if your the only one?  Sounds dull to me that way!  Besides, sometime syou have to pass on messages to others from 'other' places [:O]

This question came up before a couple of years ago, also as a result of the stuff published on MysticWeb. According to their logic, I should never be able to obe now, as I have tried to share everything I know about the topic. But they still come about virtually every morning.
<br>
<br>
And what about people such as Robert Bruce who must have shared his experiences with millions. He still has obe's. Bob Monroe must have sold zillions of his book Journeys, founded the Monroe Institute, etc., etc. yet he continued to have obe's right up until he shed his physical. It's just nonsense. Like not walking under ladders and stuff (ha ha, reminds me of you Stephen!!!).
<br>

Yours,
<br>

If talking about it makes it happen less, why does it happen more often to astralpulse members than before they came to astralpulse?

Yes, the folks over there at that other web site are a bit self centered in their views about sharing aren't they.  That's why I am over here now instead of there, because I believe in sharing.
<br>
<br>
Concerning dreams, they are personal and many times reveal things about the dreamer themself that they might not want someone else to know, so the only concern about sharing a dream might be to be careful
<br>
about not sharing too many details, however, if a person has an alias and no one knows who they are, then what difference would it make anyway.
<br>
<br>
Concerning sharing astral experiences, a person might want to look at their motive behind sharing it.  If it is to glorify oneself and boost ones one ego, then it might be best not to share it, however, if the reason for sharing it is to share a technique that one discovered that helped in the projection, or if one has questions about the projection they wish to have answered, then it would probably be good to share it.
<br>
<br>
I'm glad to have a site like this where one can share things and talk about topics openly and freely.  Thanks Astral Pulse !
