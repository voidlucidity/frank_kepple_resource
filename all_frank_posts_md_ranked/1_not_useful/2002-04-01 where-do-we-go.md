I have a question that doesn't seem to come up alot.
<br>
<br>
For the projectors (including myself), that only get out around the house and neighborhood.   And desire to move on...
<br>
<br>
How to open the Astral Planes and find a common meeting area?  Like a recreational place, or learning classes where we can come and go as we please?
<br>
<br>
Are there such places?   And are they common to everyone&lt; meaning an actual place where other travelers can meet and communicate?  Or are these places the creation of the individual?
<br>
<br>
If you are experienced in these places, could you describe them and tell how you focused to get there?
<br>

Experiences like yours are something I have been struggling to comprehend in recent times. You see, I had (and to an extent still have) the opposite problem. Up until fairly recently I could not, for the life of me, project into the real-time zone. Problem was, I'd got into the habit of just whooshing off and seeing where I'd end up. I would also read articles in books about "Astral Gateways" and think what on earth they could possibly be?
<br>
<br>
The Astral regions are infinite in size and navigating from one region to another is tricky. You could spend years having hundreds and hundred of experiences and each one could be entirely different. But a way to navigate to a particular area is to hold an image of the place in mind whilst undergoing the projection process. Again, that's what I am trying to teach myself to do at the moment and I'd be interested to hear of your progress.
<br>

Hey Frank,
<br>
<br>
When I was younger, I always thought the astral realms were somewhere out near the edge of space.  So when I projected I would concentrate on going up.  I would go through the ceiling, up into the attic,( softly bumping thru the wooden beams along the way)and end up 30 feet above the roof of the house, wondering " Now what?".  Something would hold me back from going any higher. Possibly a fear of heights, so I would then go along the streets of my neighborhood, looking down into the yards of all the houses.
<br>
Now that I look back on this, it seems like I wasted alot of OBE's.
<br>
<br>
My new thoughts are that the astral realms are not up in space. They are all around us, I do not have to travel to get there.   They are just a phase shift, or a change of thought.  Just as close as stepping to the left or right, and you're there!
<br>
<br>
What do you think about this?

<section>
Nightflier- I think you hit the nail on the head in your last post about these realms being all around us.  Last night I was listening to parts of Robert Bruce's interview with Art Bell and he talked about a place where there is a giant grid, and within each grid there is a structure (which he describes as being similar to the picture on the cover of astral dynamics)- this structure is a sort of door than upon entering one finds himself in a certain astral realm.  Bruce even talks about mapping these out.
<br>
Of course one of the most difficult things is that, just like our waking physical life, everything is so SUBJECTIVE or in other words it's different for everybody depending on their belief system, personal experiences, etc.
<br>
In regards to your original post I would have to say that for astral travellers to all meet in one place would be possible, but not probable- giving the fact that most of us are all beginners and also we are all on different levels of understanding and progression.  I do believe, however, there are indeed realms and planes inhabited by beings all of a certain level of progression/light or however you would want to classify this.  The fact of the matter is that when we leave these bodies for the last time (death) these things will become much more clear.  Until then it's going to be interesting (and it's sure to be just as interesting afterwards)

 The Astral planes are not completely seperate planes as such, and neither is the physical world seperate, but rather the lower reaches of a space-time continuum, at the top of which is the "eternal now". This continuum, at the Astral level, does have distinct areas, or planes, but are still a continuum just with less Astral material between the planes.
 <br>
 <br>
 Basically, we have the Astral realms, and beyond that the Mental realms. The energy body of an OBE is much too dense to reach, with any certainty, anywhere but the lower Astral for most people. To reach all of the Astral planes and the Mental, or Spirit planes, you would need to travel in your Mental or Spirit body only, i.e. without the density of the Astral vehicle.
 <br>
 <br>
 Somewhere, Robert Bruce has an article about projecting from the lowest levels to the Astral, as he had the same problem originally.  From memory, I believe Robert suggests focussing on a point on the horizon, and flying towards that point as fast as you possibly can - like the speed of light. If you get it wrong, you will end up in outer space somewhere and have to return, but hopefully you will feel a dimensional shift, and you will find yourself somewhere in the Astral.
 <br>
 <br>
 Best regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian.

 Absolutely correct!!!!

 Okay, you have to understand that I have an electronics engineering background so, to me, the terms phase-shift and frequency-shift are entirely different. If you were to ask me I would say it is a frequency shift.
 <br>
 <br>
 Okay, I gotta leave this thread as dinner is served.

I thank all of you for your comments!
<br>
<br>
See, now I'm getting some direction on this.  Robert Monroe said once he was out, he would then seperate again to a finer body from his projected body.  This must be the frequency change Frank is talking about.  Frank, you must be directly projecting into this second body or frequency, hense skipping the real-time projection.
<br>
<br>
So next time I get out I'll need to remember to try this. I don't vibrate when I'm out, it's quiet and peaceful. So I'll have to figure out what I have that can be tuned...
<br>
<br>
Facinating!!

I like the way this post has gone so far.  So everyone keep your comments coming...

 It might not be that simple unfortunately
 <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 We have three fundamental bodies - physical, Astral/Soul, Mental/Spirit. The joined Astra-Mental body is fairly dense, and accordingly is restricted to the level of the Astral which corresponds to its density. The Mental body is *much* finer, and can travel the entire Astral and the Mental planes - again, to a level which corresponds to its density.
 <br>
 <br>
 The above applies after the death of the physical body, as well as when projecting.
 <br>
 <br>
 Within the Astral, the "planes" are vibrating at different frequencies. Think of TV set - there are thousands of channels being broadcast concurrently, but you can only tune into one at a time.  So to travel to a higher "plane", your Astra-Mental body needs to be fine enough to allow it, and your vibration needs to be increased - "raising your vibrations".
 <br>
 <br>
 So an Astral plane shift upwards, is a dimensional shift, bought about by an increase in the frequency of vibration of your Astra-Mental body.
 <br>
 <br>
 This is my current understanding of these matters anyway

Hello Adrian,
<img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
<br>
<br>
So as I put this together into words it reads as follows;
<br>
<br>
As I change my frequency or rate there-of, I will shed the denser astral body and refine myself to a finer mental/spirit body. Thus in tune with the now accesible astral/mental planes.  Which I will be able then to travel in...
<br>
<br>
I know it's not as easy as it sounds, but I've been stuck in the real-time muck for so long. I'm willing to put 110% effort into breaking this frequency wide open!
<br>
<br>
GEEEZZ!!  I can't get this stupid smile off my face...

 In a word - no
 <img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 Astral and Mental travel are different disciplines, requiring different approaches.
 <br>
 <br>
 I am not sure why you are stuck at the real time level of the Astral, but you need to somehow figure out how to shift to the main Astral - once there you should be able travel between the planes to the extent that the density of your Astra-Mental body allows, and the level of vibrations you can achieve for the dimensional shift. I have heard for example that drinking alcohol will lower your vibrations, and accordingly restrict you to a lower level of the Astral - not good if you need to shift up to escape some low Astral wildlife or entity that is threatening.
 <br>
 <br>
 I suggest that you try Roberts method first. Next time you project into the real-time zone as usual, pick a point on the horizon, take off, and fly towards it at maximum possible speed. I think Robert says that if you get it wrong you will end up in outer space, if you get it right you should feel the dimensional shift and be in the Astral.
 <br>
 <br>
 Or, you could try Frank's method and go directly Astral.
 <br>
 <br>
 It seems to me to be related to exit technique. If you exteriorise your awareness to the physical, it seems that is where you will arrive after you project. But Frank's method tunes directly into the Astral, without exteriorising to the physical first. This is supported by the fact that Frank says if he uses "Rope technique" he can then get in to the real time zone, whereas before he seemed stuck in the Astral
 <img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
 <br>
 <br>
 This suggests that the zone projected to is technique dependant and not projector dependant.
 <br>
 <br>
 Good night, and good luck!

Nightflier,
<br>
<br>
Back to your first question, on wether or not groups can meet together, the answer (in my experience) is a whole hearted yes!  There are many ways to get everyone in a group, but at the same time...there will be those that will get lost, and not have any idea what is going on - which is unfortunate.  Typically, a 'leader' if you will creates the safe haven on their own than create an astral imprint/doorway, and than "gives" the keys (in this case the symbol) to those that will be allowed in.  During projection, the individual just has to focus on the symbol, and they will end up at the desired location...well it works for me, but everyone is different!
<br>
<br>
Later,
<br>
Jason

I've always had a pretty dense astral body.
<br>
When I go through the walls, I can feel the 2X4's, they give me some resistance. Sometimes it feels like they actually turn my direction a little. My bedroom door is cardboard filled and has the same consistency as windows, like pushing through a film of toilet tissue.
<br>
I've never really gone out and done a study on what materials offer what resistance.  I don't think of these things when I'm out. It's more like ,{ OK, I'm out, gotta keep moving. Get away from the physical, get outside , ok now I'm safe...}  If I stayed in the bedroom too long I would slowly get pulled back into the physical. This is my Astral survival technique...
<br>
<br>
{ Adrian,  I will try everything, and I will find the way...  Thanks
