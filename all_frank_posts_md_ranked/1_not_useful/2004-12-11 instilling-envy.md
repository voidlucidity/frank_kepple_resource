<section>
Over the many years I've been studying spiritual development, I have a fundamental problem which I haven't been able to solve. I feel ashamed to talk about it, because it sounds like gloating, and I believe it has stunted my spiritual progress for quite some time. I'd like to know if anyone else has found this problem difficult, and what their views are on it.
<br>
<br>
When you activate your spiritual potential, and attract abundance into your life, do you find that people are jealous of you? Does this eventually lead to anger? Finally, do you feel guilty for causing it?
<br>
<br>
I know what it's like to feel jealous. It's terrible and fills one with hopelessness and self-loathing. Worse, the feeling is partly justified - why should someone be so lucky, and others not? I know it sounds silly, but I do not want to be successful if it causes others jealously. I would rather be lonely, impoverished and die of hunger than cause someone to loathe themself.
<br>
<br>
So, I have not been actualizing my potential in the way I used to. When I was in school, and progressed spiritually, I attracted the attention of many. As if out of no where, I was given opportunities that I previously fantasized about, like a leading role in a small play set in my favorite era (the 1940s). I was more athletic, people laughed at my jokes, I attracted *all* the most popular girls (it was a small school).
<br>
<br>
People began vying for my attention and my friendship. The actors at the high school wanted me to start joining them, but the more popular circles considered that verboten, for people who joined them were weird. That is just one example, but others were more personal.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have problems with their advancement because they are instilling envy?

It is really nothing to worry about.  What you are experiencing now is the phenomena of being what is called "a big fish in a small pond".  The attention you are now receiving will be as nothing if you should decide to move up in the World to a station where you are more with those who are your equals and, better yet, those to whom you are yet inferior.
<br>
<br>
The best thing for you to do for yourself now, is to remain humble.  You can do this by lifting up your tastes -- expose yourself to arts, music, literature, and where possible, people who excel your present tastes and company.  You must not compare yourself to your present small town standards, but set yourself up against Universal and Cosmopolitan References.
<br>
<br>
Then, in addition to all the other things people admire you for, they will also admire you for your Great Humility.

Telos,
<br>
This problem is a minor thing for me on a personal level. However, you hit the nail on the head about what is embedded in
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///society.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 society.It
</a>
is very difficult problem on this level .Your not gloating at all.More people should be so observant.
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, anger exists with or without you. Jealousy is a more personal thing. You may be the focus of someone's (or more) jealousy. It's not your burden, why feed it? Starve a neg. Dealing with other people's neg problems is not worth the time or effort. Protect yourself and your belongings.Experiment by changing or distancing your friends/contacts of suspect. You shouldn't waste your precious time on those who don't have anything to offer, especially if your best interest is not considered by them. If they have something you need for spiritual progression then be prepared to pay the price. Pillaging and plundering comes to mind. Mainly because this is what happened to me (kids
<img alt=":shock:" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/shocked.png" title="Shocked"/>
). A nice lesson about people, but not good when planning your future. In other words, pick your friends carefully. If your ostracized because of who you socialize with, they did you a favor. They made your choice easy.
<br>
<br>
The best way to see your situation is by assessing the neighbors living around you. The physical goings on in your immediate physical surroungs tells you what is going in your more extended environment. See or hear anything?
<br>
<br>
Don't be discouraged by the negative collective. Your journey is what ever you want it to be. If you have big ideas don't let anyone get in your way. Keep you path clear.
<br>
<br>
I like what Leo said about "a big fish in a little pond". It makes sense. I've always thought of it as "a high school mentality", then a few graduate.

<section>
First of all, I should say that the experience I described happened years ago. I am no longer a teen, no longer confined by the complex social dynamics of schools, which are not unlike prisons. I'm in my early twenties, but the same problem appears to carry over into adult life.
<br>
<br>
The "negative collective."
<br>
<br>
I agree that being the object of jealousy isn't one's personal burden. However the causal relationship remains. This is a rudimentary example:
<br>
<br>
A = B
<br>
A mysteriously achieves more success
<br>
A &gt; B
<br>
B, who was not previously jealous of A, feels there is injustice, and is now jealous of A.
<br>
<br>
The result is a destabilization of equilibrium. In a way, wisp, this is feeding the neg.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is my own view that jealously is natural. It arises out of a state of fear that one's circumstances are brittle and prone to bad luck. An objective observation will yield that yes, indeed, entropy harms more people than it favors. However the human mind can be used in extropy. Why isn't it practiced?
<br>
<br>
Maybe A never equaled B, and the result is actually more of a return to equilibrium?
<br>
<br>
If that is the case, am I to move forward with the idea that I am naturally superior to others, yet project a feeling of humility?
<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, I just don't understand why people are so negative. Actually, I do understand why people are so negative - they have a great deal of evidence which suggests the universe is a horrible place to live. However, I do not understand why they don't take the very simple and joyously exciting road to self-enlightenment. Is it because of their conditioning?
<br>
<br>
If I didn't know any better, I'd have the suspicion that they are of different creators. What are your opinions on why the negative collective is the way it is?
<br>
<br>
I find its existence to be uncanny. Not only is it wholly unnecessary, but millenia after the great spiritual teachers have left us, still only few understand, if any. I have few, if any, personal desires for myself, which is why I've been okay with leading a solitary life. The empyrean of the higher realms is more than enough for me - any pain I feel here is largely inconsequential. With that in mind, I feel as if I had (possibly still have) the power to do something Promethean that would rescue people from their traps of negativity. Prometheus gave people fire. Jesus gave people eternal life. Buddha gave people relief of suffering. I want to see people given clarity.
<br>
<br>
My journey is halted because I feel I was fertilizing the ground for more madness... a decided no-no.
<br>
<br>
I appreciate your thoughts and encouragements and hope you will continue the discussion.
<br>

<br>
As I pointed out, you need to be comparing yourself against a whole different and more universal and cosmopolititan Standard... not against your local set of hicks and heyseeds.
<br>
<br>
Take Bruce Springstein for an example -- he does not compare himself to the local geeks in the garage bands... he compares himself to the other stars... he flinches when other Song Writers do decent Movie Soundtracks, or puts serious hit songs in the Top 40.  He is humbled by the success of his Peers... not his silly gulky neighbors in Asbury Park.
<br>
<br>
Now, is it somehow wrong for you to place yourself in this Higher League of Greater People.  Well, only if you do not merit belonging there.  Even Jesus Christ spoke of Shepherds and Sheep.  The Religious Language of every Higher Moral Religion speaks of the Common People in the metaphor of calling them mere children.  The Generality of Humanity IS of a lesser order than that Gifted Minority who are graced with being of higher capacities.   But as I have said, Humility can be maintained NOT by comparing yourself to those for whom you are Greater, but by concentrating your Vision on those who still excel you.  However, Great you think you are, there will always be somebody who is Better.  Just imagine how Springstein feels when he hears "Bat out of Hell".

<section>
Telos,
<br>
Sorry, I didn't mean that you are in High School. However, there is a mentality out there where the social and personal roles of one are not clear. Misconceptions seem to be affirmed there. Once this potential for ... is "jelled", they never get past it. IMO.
<br>
<br>
Yes, this is often the case regarding what you say,"...the same problem appears to carry over into adult life."
<br>
I believe we are presented with the same problem(s) over and over again. I too have blocks, barriors, and troublesome life lessons to understand. It seems life scenerios do repeat until the lesson is identified, and then resolved hopefully.Jealousy has been one of the things I've had to deal with. The only good I've seen as a result of this visited upon me by others is a competitive action in order to either "show me up" or place me beneath their feet. If someone needs that kind of incentive to better themself, great...I just don't think the need to crush or walk on someone will have a good result for that person.But, if that person evolves in the meantime, that's wonderful. I'm not much for the competitive spirit myself, but many are. I guess I've been lucky that I haven't attracted too many who use negative emotion (or what ever it is) to kick start themselves into action in life. These are not the worst of the lot. There are some with really bad intentions, but these are fewer in numbers. This is about jealousy advancing to hatred. Every once in a while this kind shows up in my life. I am very sensitive to this because of what is called energy stealing. Energy stealers are not necessarily jealous, their just the most dangerous.Anytime I get in a good position to cause a change for the better, one of these killers show
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///up.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 up.It
</a>
does cause set backs for me. I think that maybe my path in life doesn't involve improving anything. As you have stated, there are those greater than myself who have.
<br>
<br>
I don't see jealousy as natural. It's counter productive, and not an integral part of the good.
<br>
<br>
The negative collective is dispersed and hard to discribe. For starters, it's the formation of false ideas or ideals.When these false and faulty thought systems are integrated into society, society forms into something other than what it should be. It's not a person or any physical thing. Call it an attitude or mindset. Examples of such a thing are political correctness, gambling (insurance companies for example), justice systems, healthcare. At least these things produce the most awareness of such a thing as I see as a collective problem.
<br>
<br>
How do you see the negative collective, Telos?
<br>
<br>
A book I keep forgetting to look for when I'm out is The Mothman Prophecies. I saw the movie and a negative collective was hinted in it. I know a Reiki instructor who received a sense of "something" from that movie as well. It's something hard to put your finger on. In the movie (based on a true story), a bridge collapses from an unknown reason. There was a predictable factor (reason it's called prophesy). The enitity in this movie is an interesting manifestation. Before seeing this movie, I had had an encounter with something.The creature in the movie was very similar. A sense of foreboding is included with this encounter. I'm not sure this is the direction you wanted me to take. Different creators or collective subconscious?

<section>
You're very sensible, Leo. I like your candidness and your respect for history.
<br>
<br>
My earlier progress came in not acknowledging human superiority of any kind. I regarded metaphysical phenomena as superior - knowledge, experience, skills, emotional intelligence, etc. - but not the people who possessed them.  I was not fooled by title, position, or recognition from others, and felt that they were all largely undeserved. I saw everyone as if they were on equal ground. After all, they are on equal ground - the ground of the earth, the ground of physical time, and the ground of mammalian DNA. I did humble myself, just not towards others, for humbling is submissive respect. I felt that common respect was better (superior), more difficult and more appropriate. I did not want people to humble themselves before me - they should humble themselves before a higher power.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps I just do not understand humility, or that I think our concept of humility is outdated. I was not arrogant, boasting, or prideful - not in ways that would elevate myself above others, just in ways that would elevate myself above my previous condition. I was, and still still am, deeply concerned for the well-being of others and I wish that they too could have a growing relationship with the higher powers of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
If I thought I was great, it was great in the role I was playing, which is categorically different from the roles of others, which allow no common dimension for comparison.
<br>
<br>
The Springsteen example is good. He should not pay attention to inferior skills but humble himself before superior skills so that he may learn them. I do not think I am comparing myself to local yokels (as you might refer
<img alt=";)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/wink.png" title="Wink"/>
), for I do not compare myself to others in any way. I compare knowledge to knowledge, experience to experience, etc.
<br>
<br>
Should I compare myself to others? Does spiritual progress happen on a common plane, or within the hearts and minds of individuals? Our interaction with each other makes a difference - otherwise I would not feel discouraged in causing jealously in others nor would we talking about it in a forum. But that's only evidence that our private universes intersect, not that they are the same.
<br>
<br>
This intersection creates a kind of metaphysical network, such that we are all part of a common multiverse in some way or another, but is that commonality a basis for comparison? It is the nature of the intersection which concerns me.
<br>
<br>
I suppose this is confusing when paired with my previous post. I gave an example where "A = B," and then moved out of equilibrium. I was trying to simplify the explanation, but since I do not know the full nature of my problem, that equation was unwarranted, for I did not specify my variables. I don't believe there is any basis for comparing A to B, insofar as A and B are measures of being a person. Being a person is qualitative, and I don't believe it is appropriate to measure it.
<br>
<br>
I just deleted a few paragraphs of theory on measuring virtue or morality, but I suppose that is getting into another discussion... or perhaps it isn't. Hmm :/

<section>
Thank you for your reply wisp. Your thoughts on the negative collective are clear and lucid.
<br>
<br>
Extropy is the human capability to create order through the use of reason, science, and understanding. More broadly, the theory of extropy states that, given a large enough random system and a long enough time period, a process of ordered growth (evolution) will continue long enough so as to overtake the entire system and replace it with harmony. A corollary to the theory states that the evolving process will continue to harness randomness locally and indefinitely or until it's reached "perfection." Anyways, our species has the faculty of reasoning and understanding, so why aren't some people using them? Are they a different species?
<br>
<br>
Most likely it's because as you said Wisp, that people were raised not learning how to use them - they were not allowed opportunities to use reason for their own purposes. In American, school does MUCH to inhibit the growth of self-reasoning, but that's another story...
<br>
<br>
What do I think of the negative collective? I fear that it is an artifact of nature, which means that the Creator of nature is of inferior intelligence, ability, or virtue - and none of those ideas sit well with me. Mystics say we create our own nature, in which case we must use our imaginations to power extropy (to put a word on it) and change our nature for the better.
<br>
<br>
So, what's needed to change the negative collective is something that changes people's imaginations. I have been interested in art - perhaps a skillfull artist could change imaginations en masse. But, so far artists haven't been very powerful or skillful in this regard. Do you think that there are more efficient avenues for changing the negative collective, like science, organized religion, government or business?
<br>
<br>

Never once in my life have I said..."They are just jealous."  It wouldn't occur to me.  Also, I would try to look more introspectively at my own actions before making that type of statement.
<br>
<br>
Could you give an example of a time when someone was obviously jealous of you??
<br>
<br>
I have had people that were not worth my energy get too near to me, and I suffered for it.  But, I don't think it was out of jealously or envy.  Then again maybe it was...lol

Thank you for your reply, Mona and daem0n.
<br>
<br>
I've been struggling with the definition of humility, trying to study its etymology, its usage in holy books or philosophical works.. I'll post again when I've studied more.
<br>
<br>
Monica, I used the school play example already so I will continue with that. I apparently "stole the show," away from the other performers. It was a wide selection of musical acts from various other plays, and there were many leading roles. I had only a few minutes of time as the main actor in the Guys and Dolls scene, and I felt it was really "me" so I gave it my all. The response from the crowd was rather astounding. People I had never met before said that wanted to meet "the star of the play." I even heard those words from the parents of my friends. The next night, while all the performers were getting together for the opening act, the director's daughter and the rest of the girls wished
<i>
 me
</i>
luck in front of everybody else, just after we had wished each other luck. As you can imagine, some of my friends were irritated, for they had roles of their own which were just as challenging. I would be lying if I said that I did not intentionally attract all this attention -&gt; I put all of my spiritual energy into it, like I did many other things at the time. I know it sounds silly and boastful, but I felt bad for being so good.
<br>
<br>
Do you have any similar experiences? Do you think my feeling bad was justified?

Well in all fairness, if it wasn't a one man show....
<br>
You should have made sure the people performing with you got the credit they deserved as well.  Maybe you just basked in the limelight of your own wonderfulness a bit too much..lol  Maybe it bothered everyone that you didn't see the importance of their roles, in relation to yours.
<br>
<br>
It feels great to feel special.  It feels wonderful to be in the limelight and to get compliments. (in every aspect of life!)
<br>
<br>
You should strive to make other's feel that way too!!
<br>
It's a give and take...
<br>
If you just take, of course it will leave people feeling resentful.

That is just an imprecise example. A story. Real personal jealously evolves over time, the same way that real self-loathing evolves over time. That is what concerns me.
<br>
<br>
I'm just confused on why people are bothered by the success of others. I'd like to help them.
<br>
<br>
And in all seriousness, Monica, spirit doesn't poo.

Oh no...spirit does poo!
<br>
<br>
It's called immaculate defecation.  Poof...It just goes away!
<br>
<br>
<br>
In all seriousness though...
<br>
<br>
I have never had this problem.  I doubt it's because I'm lacking anything to be envious over.  I think it's because...I don't think about things like, who I am superior to and who I am not superior to.  (spiritually or otherwise)  And I certainly don't have the type of ego that would allow me to assume that it must be out of envy, if someone has a problem with me.
<br>
<br>
By the way "To give is to take"

What the heck is that?  That's just silly!
<br>

I appreciate where you are coming from, but it is foreign to me.
<br>
I mean now what....You are going to go on a great excursion to help those that are envious of you??  IS THAT AN EGO IN YOUR POCKET?? LOL
<br>
<br>
Okay, don't get mad at my post...I'm in a saucy mood.

That's okay. I acknowledge that I have a tremendous ego. But if I have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, it's because I have an exaggerated sense that all life is important. Should I not have an exaggerated sense of your importance as well?

Telos,
<br>
First, I would like to congratulate you on what you wrote about your performance. It sounds
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///mesmerizing.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 mesmerizing.It
</a>
sounds like you have more than one form of art.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of performances. Isn't that what we do on a daily basis too? A person's attitude makes all the difference. Glow and color stands out in a crowd. People are attracted to the animated. It sounds like you have the important attributes.
<br>
<br>
I had a dream once showing a large white canvas.I didn't understand until waking up at a rest stop not long ago. I could tell I visualized and produced the scenery through my eyelids before opening them. There were trees in the background.The rest is up to me.
<br>

I don't have an awareness of a negative collective in science or religion. Both break the illusion of chaos.Both are a tool of civilization.Government (here anyway) was suppose to be for road building. Anything beyond this is open to interpretation.Imagine a world without insurance (a business). Think of the changes that could occur in people's thinking. Insurance's purpose is to restore something lost. What if people could experience loss instead of being paid for it? Things could be seen more clearly and quicker, opposed to delaying the inevitable. Denial, delaying, and paying (or getting reimbursed) to get out of natural order is a mistake.The existence of such man made systems changes the consequences. Does one want to live in a false sense of security, or speed it along for an interesting journey.  Instead of debt, pay as you go, less to lose (if that's going to happen). This in turn will dwindle down the unecessary. Last but not least, stop blaming others for one's own misfortune. If people would accept responsibilty for their own life's creation it would be just as rich. In this country anyway, it pays to lose, it pays to be sick, it pays to be ignorant. How sick is that?!
<br>
<br>
This is a simplification, of course. Until the culprits of disorder are identified, many are guilty of crimes against nature and man.Are the people in prison really the criminals?But, that's another story.

"I know it sounds silly, but I do not want to be successful if it causes others jealously. I would rather be lonely, impoverished and die of hunger than cause someone to loathe themself. "
<br>
<br>
Don't.  If someone loathes themselves because they are jealous of someone who is living a good life, then this is THEIR issue with jealousy.  They will continue to be jealous of anyone successful even if you personally decided to become lonely, impoverished, and dying of hunger.  Jealousy is a problem they need to overcome, I mean they need to if they are going to progress spiritually, and they never will if successful people cater to their neuroses.
<br>
<br>
Here's a situation that sometimes comes up.  When people see me and my partner and we're so obviously in love, some people get bitter and jealous and say, "You shouldn't be that way until I have someone to love, too." (no joke, someone really did say that!) Other people say, "I love being around you two.  I love seeing people in love and feeling that energy."  Who am I going to listen to?  I'm sure not going to end our relationship to please that first person.

You're right. You're all right. Thank you all for your considerate replies.
<br>
<br>
If someone is truly spiritually advanced and is successful, and others are jealous of this person, than he or she will serve them by not feeling bad, but good, for it may eventually spread. It is a short walk from jealously to inspiration.
<br>
<br>
Wisp, should I ever use an example of a highly advanced civilization, perhaps the way Plato did of Atlantis, I would say that they had no insurance companies - and not for lack of danger.

Telos:
<br>
<br>
When we form part of a group, we all lend energy to the "group production" as it were. It appears what you did was use the occasion as a springboard to further your own ends. In traditional terms, the others will feel that you stole their limelight, and in public too, which will simply make them feel like you are, "rubbing it in". The energy they are projecting as a result of that, you are interpreting as jealousy or whatever.
<br>
<br>
In my life, to date, I have met a number of what society might call
<i>
 successful
</i>
people. I cannot recall any of them having a problem with others as regards jealousy or such like. Then again, people who are
<i>
 truly
</i>
successful are those who use their talents to help further other people's development, or ease their misfortune, in all manner of ways. In the course of that, they automatically further their own. In that way no one resents it, as people perceive it as a "fair" exchange. But in your stage example, people will feel you just usurped their energy for your own ends.
<br>
<br>
You are young and still have much to learn. But at least you
<i>
 are
</i>
trying to question and you
<i>
 are
</i>
trying to learn. This can only be a good thing. So I (for one) would advise you to keep creating the circumstances that present you with opportunities to question your motives, and to learn more about yourself.
<br>
<br>
Humility is a word I dislike using as it has all manner of religious and/or mystical belief constructs attached to it. But the general idea is what I think of as a state of unaffectedness.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

  Quote from: Telos

 <br>
 <br>
 I apparently "stole the show," away from the other performers. It was a wide selection of musical acts from various other plays, and there were many leading roles. I had only a few minutes of time as the main actor in the Guys and Dolls scene, and I felt it was really "me" so I gave it my all. The response from the crowd was rather astounding. ..... I would be lying if I said that I did not intentionally attract all this attention -&gt; I put all of my spiritual energy into it, like I did many other things at the time. I know it sounds silly and boastful, but I felt bad for being so good.
 <br>
 <br>
 Do you have any similar experiences? Do you think my feeling bad was justified?
</blockquote>
<br>
Telos
<br>
<br>
I don't think your feeling bad about yourself was justified.  In school I also had the experience of gaining positive attention for my musical compositions &amp; performances, often at the expense of the work of others. While I didn't take any pleasure in their relative lack of success, neither did I see it as reason to feel bad about myself. I see artistic work as something which may have merit in itself, independently of the person who produces it. The artist is, in my view, both expressing their self in the work, and also acting as a conduit for something greater, - as a kind of co-creator. I believe great art has an elevating effect on those who witness it, and that we have gifts to use, to make the world a better place. (sorry if this sounds pompous!) In works/performances of true brilliance, people will  very often pick up on both of these aspects &amp; respond very positively, like your audience at the play. They might not know what it was about your performance that set you apart, but it was a real quality, one which stood out all the more sharply in comparison to the relative mediocrity of the others. And it was related to your effort to 'give your all'. Maybe you tapped into something beyond your self in your performance, &amp; your friends didn't. Why should you feel bad about making a sincere effort to do your best, to entertain people &amp; enjoy yourself too? And why should you feel bad that  your classmates either didn't bother, or didn't succeed in their attempts to do the same?
<br>
<br>
If they truly cared about performing, they'd put aside their jealousy &amp; be inspired instead. But if they chose not to, that truly isn't your problem.  Maybe they're where they need to be right now, on their own path. But this world is awash with mediocrity, and by hiding your light under a bushel, you'd be depriving others of the chance to become inspired &amp; elevate themselves. It's not the same as being arrogant - you can express your gifts to their fullest potential, be rewarded for them, and still be a good person. And even if you make yourself nothing, there will still be those who react negatively! So why even try?

Frank, thank you, it's good to know that an advanced person such as yourself also has trouble using the word humilty.
<br>
<br>
Neutrino, I highly agree with what you said about artists expressing themselves

 and

acting as a conduit. You, along with the rest, have convinced me to return to honest and skillful performance, unaffected by the apparent result in negativity, and unceasingly inspire others.

Not to worry, about the humility part, everyone is different. If it shows up for you, you'll know it. For me, humility is connected with risk factors.That is, knowing when your in too deep (you'll know). So far, I've rallied, thanks be to God (credit, where credit is due).
