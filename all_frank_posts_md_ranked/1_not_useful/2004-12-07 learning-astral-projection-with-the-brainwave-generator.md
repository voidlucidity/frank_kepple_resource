<section>
Hello everyone! This is Brian Mercer, co-author (with Robert Bruce) of Mastering Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
I just posted an article on Robert's site that might interest you. It's called "Learning Astral Projection with the BrainWave Generator". In it I recount my first experience with the BrainWave Generator, how I developed the presets for Mastering Astral Projection, and a bit about the BrainWave Generator's free on-line preset library.
<br>
<br>
Even if your spiritual goals don't include OBE, there are other uses for the BWGen, such as healing, energy body and primary center stimulation, learning, lucid dreaming, etc.
<br>
<br>
The article can be found here:

Thanks alot Brian Mercer.
<br>
We all will enjoy this
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
I've wanted for a long time to be able to use Bwgen (Brainwave Generator) to the purpous of Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
It just hasn't seem to fit together that well for me yet.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>

<section>
Awesome! I'd already come across this site, but now that you've endorsed it, and pointed out to me that it's free, I'm much more encouraged to try it.
<br>
<br>
Listening to tapes sounds so much easier than doing energy work. Even so, I don't plan to rely upon them, as I plan to have great adventures that take me places where even a mobile CD player can't go!
<br>
<br>
Have you found there are any possible harmful effects from using this brainwave generator? Any reliances, or weaknesses that can result from it? I don't want any more weaknesses right now. I wouldn't mind, however, if I got one weakness in exchange for eleven that it would eliminate.
<br>
<br>
Can we make this a sticky?

I have acquired the Mastering Astral Projection book and use it everyday. I want you (Robert Bruce and Brian Mercer) to know that I admire the work you both have done.  Many years ago, a bought a copy of Astral Dynamics, and after reading it, I decided it was beyond me. I then donated the book to a non profit bookstore. Later on, I felt an urge to read Astral Dynamics again. So, I bought me another copy. After I read it, I felt that it would be great if Robert Bruce had a workbook that would help people like me. The next day, I decided to look at the Astral Pulse web site, and then somewhere I saw an article about the future publication of the Mastering Astral Projection book. I ordered it in advance and then got it when it was released. It was what I was looking for!
<br>
I think Robert Bruce has made an enormous contribution to the world with his knowledge and  altruism; and as for my part, I thank him, for I have benefited greatly from his effort.  There are many others, specially moderators who offer their invaluable assistance to whom we should extend our appreciation. I want Frank (Moderator) to know that I enjoy reading his remarks as well. I think he expresses himself  intelligently and constructively and people such as I can only benefit from his efforts.
<br>
<br>
Season Greetings to All.
<br>
<br>
To end this, may I recommend an insightful book title and a couple of web sites:

I like this BWGen, not only do they provide their things free, but they give links to competitors (via the google link) so that they're fair and impartial. I wish all companies would do this.
<br>
<br>
Unless of course all the companies are owned by the same people... *squints*
<br>
<br>
Anyway, since I don't have headphones right now, until I get them I'm using one I found from another website that say they don't need headphones, and you can play it over any music you like. I'm doing hard rock and video game music!

There must be a lot of controversy about these issues... why else would there be so many differing websites? You'd think the enhanced senses of awareness produced by these sounds would put them above greed, or at least see the benefit in working together.
<br>
<br>
Why are there so many different companies?

Look at the back of your computer - you will (most probably) find a green mini jack socket - plug your headphones there.

The CD does not contain MP3/WAV versions of the BWGEN presets, but BWGEN has an option to create them (you just enter how many minutes you want, and a WAV is created).

If anyone is having trouble finding out how to get their headphones to hook up to their computer they should conduct a search of the back of the computer. The will probably locate the sound card and notice a little hole in it. That's where you plug up your headphones.

Rename the preset you want to use to "default.bwg" or "presets.bwg" in your BWG folder (keep the old one as backup), then start BWG and you should be able to use the preset.

This is the the first FAQ on BWGen. Taken from BWGen faq webpage.
<br>
<br>
Question: Can I save BrainWave Generator output as an MP3 file?
<br>
Answer: Not directly. You can save BrainWave Generator output as a WAV file, and then use another application to convert WAV to MP3.
<br>
Due to the high licensing fees required for MP3 encoders, direct MP3 generation will not be included even in future versions of BrainWave Generator.

I think the software that came with your CD burner should be able to create an audio CD from WAV files...  Choose to create an audio CD, select the WAV files you want and burn!

I bought it last week.
<br>
Was it worth it?
<br>
Well, I look at it this way. I've been using the "free" Unregistered version for about 6 months to create my own files, so to me - Yes, it was worth the $40.
<br>
I'm not that worried about importing other peoples files. I just  really felt obligated because I've gotten so much use out of it, and now I can continue to use it guilt free!

I have to say, and I certainly don't wish to sound ungrateful, but why is this technology only available where you have to sit in front of your computer and plug your headphones into the speaker outlet?
<br>
<br>
It seems logical to assume the best format would be CD form where you can play the presets using a portable CD player, where you can lie down in bed or similar to experience these various brainwave states...
<br>
<br>
My computer is setup to play through speakers, not headphones. I can hear the presets through said speakers, but I imagine it's not the same effect as if I was hearing them through headphones.

I'm grateful for the technology and work involved, but please wake me when it's in CD form.

 <br>
 Thanks so much in advance.

If anyone is interested, you don't have to pay to register if you google a search on the Brainwave Generator serial code (3.1.11, I think), the current editon, I'm registered and I didn't pay.  Want the number?  PM me.

Ive got my Bwgen unlocked after a bit of a session. Took me about 10 attempts but I eventually got results after downloading version 3.1.9 and running the 3.1.9 patch from inside the bwgen folder. The version on my CD is 3.1.12 and all the cracks seem to be for 3.1.11, dont know if that makes any difference but none of them worked for me.
<br>
So if your a little bit wooo, little bit waaay, bit of a geeza, u dont have to pay, but youll have to fiddle around a bit.
<br>
The presets are pretty cool - way better than whats usually on offer. Hope this helps someone.

I think this is a great and relevant topic, seems a little wasted by headphone problems and hacking tips (whoops). Id be really interested to hear other peoples experiences using it. I'm just learning and this is really helping.  I have tried the rated boxed nirvana preset which is quite good but for a novice like me, i think its beyond my use for the time being. I tried the week 3 15 sec pulse from MAP today and found that to be really relaxing. If doing med/trance work, at some point I usually try and put some pressure on, listening to that today I was just happy to trance. Hopefully that means a lil bit of progress.

<section>
just make sure u run a virus check on your cracks n patches.
<br>
as bitdefender reports "trojan.small.cr" in the regpatch released by "diablo2oo2 / mAsTeR_pOwEr". i don't think it's a dangerous one. maybe just a false report. but u never know

i had good resuslts with the MAP presets, especially 'week 04 lucid dreaming'. it uses higher frequencies than abbys and boxed nirvana and my consciousnes loves to suspend itself, so i need something higher to stay in control and awareness

Hmmm... Well how would you find out what your concience likes? I mean i'm a newb to all of this and i would like to find out what a good setting for me would be on the brain wave gen i have the nirvana one and all of the weeks but i just cant seem to find one that will actually you know... make me feel energized... the first time i used it, i chose one of the original sounds that came with it and from the moment i hit play a burst of energy went through my body it felt really good like a good kind of tingling sensation i dont know what that means? what DOES it mean?
<br>
I had listened to it for a while and thought hey this is working really well, but now i've lost it and i don't know what to do... Any ideas? Now when i play it i dont get that feeling anymore... i think i may have been just a bit too excited because i really would like to get myself into those astral planes

v3.1.12=need crack for.
<br>
Either that or some place I can download all these other versions I keep seeing cracks for. :S I can't find any but the one on the official site. Am I not looking hard enough?
<br>
oops, scratch that.
<br>
for those of you with my problem, download and extract this zipfile into the bwgen.exe folder, then run crack.exe
<br>

Newsin,
<br>
<br>
The next time I'm out and about I'll remind myself to come over and slap you silly. There's a nasty little browser hijacker/virus lurking there. But I suspect you already knew that.

I would like to get this on CD that I can play in my bedroom.
<br>
