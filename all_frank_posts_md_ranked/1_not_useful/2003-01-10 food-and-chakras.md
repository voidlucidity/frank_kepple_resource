Does everyone know if there is any relationship between the color of fruit and vegetables and the chakras.  The only reason I ask is I was once told to eat yellow and orange fruit by a psychic.  I never asked why that color.  I understand vitamins have a lot to do with it.
<br>
<br>
If the color doesn't have anything to do with it does anyone know if any research has been done on which fruits and vegetables are best to eat while fasting in order to stimulate certain chakras?

I don't mean to sound harsh but your question is which are the best fruit and vegetables to eat while fasting. Okay, correct me if I am wrong but doesn't fasting entail one refrain from eating?

Depends on how long you're fasting.  A complete water fast can't be done for more than three days so there are juice fasts.
<br>
<br>
However, fasting means different things.  Jews who fast for their hollidays are allowed to eat certain thing but it's still called a fast.
<br>
<br>
If i wanted to get technical i could say "drink" instead of eat.. but saying drink vegetables to me sounds weird.
<br>
<br>
Im talking about an extended fast.. where fruit and vegetables are allowed to "drink" or eat since I dont see the difference.

Since the question was brought up.. often edgar caycee would recommend an apple fast which was to eat nothing but apples for three days.
<br>
<br>
I believe one purpose of a fast.. with a certain description.  Say a carrot fast (though i dont know the purpose of that) would be to also strengthen the effect of that food.  Water fasts are to cleanse the body since water serves that purpose.. the lack of any other food strenghtens it thereby making it more efficient.
<br>
<br>
Anyone who hasn't eaten in a while and drinks caffeine or alcohol can attest to this.  Therefore to strenthen any food's benefits its logical to fast while eating it.

Yellow and orange foods tend to have more beta carotene in them. And vitamin A, a related compound. You could search for these compounds on google and see if any health-related sites come up that ring true for you.
<br>
<br>
As to color and the chakras. I heard a few months back, that each chakra has it's own color. I'll dig around to find it. This is a bit removed from your question but may be of interest. Oh - found it, it is a series of posts on another mb, I started the string:

  You mentioned color relating to chakras. Wow! You know, I have seen (through impressions, not strong visuals) different colors while meditating. What I found so interesting was that I can recall seeing the colors up through the throat chakra (most frequently reds and blues), but I have not seen the higher colors (purple, golden, white.) The reason this is so interesting is because the last blockage I cleared was the throat chakra! And as I mentioned elsewhere, since that clearance in May I have had much better sensation in the higher chakras. I haven't approached meditation with the interest of seeing color since then, and now I am most eager to see if I will see purple, golden, and white.
  <br>
  <br>
  I wonder why different chakras would have specific colors. Naturally there is association with white = purity, and red = blood/life force ---- so those associations make sense. But why would the throat = purple? Etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  How interesting. Gemeni, thank you for pointing me towards your post on CPL. I'd love to hear more about your meditations, your technique, what you have found through the practice. You sound disciplined. I was good for a couple months through the summer, and then I entered a dead zone where every meditation was flat and empty. After a few weeks of that I decided to take a break - and I need to recommit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway -

  Patty, I don't know if you've used music while meditating, but that's what I've been doing. Not sure if I'd see colors if I didn't have the music to listen to, but I do know that it seems to help in seeing the colors - I regularly see purple and yellow that way, occasionally green or white.
  <br>
  In yoga class the other week, we were all lying on our backs during the meditative part at the end of class - and yes, the teacher put soothing music on - and she was going around to each person and pressing down on our legs to gets us more centered with the earth (her words). As she pressed on my legs, the purple I was seeing in my mind immediately switched to green. I thought that was kind of neat.
  <br>
  <br>
  My 2 favorite CD's for meditation are Benjamin Iobst's Seven Metals (singing bowls of Tibet) and William Buhlman's OM (by Tom Carey). Deborah had recommended the latter one.
  <br>
  <br>
  BTW, I got my blood pressure checked yesterday as part of a fitness program our church is starting. I've disliked getting my BP checked since I was put on bedrest at 31 weeks due to pregnancy-induced hypertension. (it had gotten as high as 160/108 at the time of diagnosis) Recently I've begun exercising again, but have been meditating fairly consistently since the spring. Well, my BP reading yesterday was a respectable 120/78! I'd like to think that meditation had helped in keeping it down.

  Hi All,
  <br>
  I usually get a golden light while meditating, sometimes brilliant white too. Very rarely I have gotten purple. One cool thing I ran across: Imagine yourself as vividly as possible standing on water (I use the ocean with vivid blue water, but you could use any color), and when you have a good feel of it, start scanning the horizon. Look for a figure coming toward you, and don't freak out, but engage it in conversation. This gets interesting......
  <br>
  love, wayne

  Hi Patty! *S*S
  <br>
  Quick thoughts - the 5th chakra is blue (throat), the 6th chakra is purple (third eye), - the reason for the colors has to do with vibration (*S) sound and light are one in the same. (Will explain more when I get home) -- Vibration resonates at different frequencies - thereby producing what we precieve to be colors.

<br>
The last submission on the topic, I take to mean that as one goes higher in the chakras, one ascends through the colors of the spectrum. Whether this has any validity or not I couldn't say, but I found the fact that I had no knowledge of this yet only experienced the lower colors prior to clearing my throat chakra, most interesting.

Egad.  Isn't purple one of the higher colors?  Eggplant is purple.  I hate eggplant!  Ug!  I don't like this theory!
<br>
<br>
Seriously though . . . surrounding yourself with certain colors can "tune" you all sorts of ways.  It works with food, it works with T-shirts, it works with the colors on your walls.
<br>
<br>
Why yellow and orange fruit?  Probably because the psychic thought it would strengthen your will, your sense of self, etc. Do you need to work on your self-esteem?
<br>
<br>
Vitamins A and C are good for you, too.  Maybe she looked at you and decided you needed some vitamins!
<br>
<br>
Personally, when I fast, I stick to yellows and greens.  Lemons, and green veggie drinks.  Not for "chakras" per se, but because they are very healing.

<section>
silva,   i  have a book  called  "chakras:  balance  your energy  flow  for health and  harmony"
<br>
<br>
It  says  and  i quote..
<br>
<br>
"the  colours  of the  chakras  from  base  to  crown  are reflected in the foods we eat.  To  activate  or  balance a chakra,  eat  foods  in its colour. To  calm a  chakras  overactivity,  avoid  food  in  its colour"
<br>
<br>
crown-  beetroot
<br>
brow-   blueberries
<br>
throat -  brocolli
<br>
heart  -  apples
<br>
solar plexus-   bananas
<br>
navel - carrots  or  oranges
<br>
base  -  tomatos   or red peppers
<br>
<br>
i  dont  know  what to make of this  silva  because  i  dont really focus  on my  diet-   but it  seems a bit  fishy to me-   the  list  above  was the example  given  in  my  book,   but  it  doesnt seem  very balanced,   its  just  vegatables  and fruit.

<section>
Just to clear up any misunderstandings.
<br>
<br>
Crown-  White
<br>
Brow-   Indigo
<br>
Throat- Blue
<br>
Heart - Green/with a bit of pink
<br>
Solar plexus- Yellow
<br>
Navel - Orange
<br>
Base -  Red
<br>
<br>
Its good to be able to visualize these colors as bright. I do a Chakra cleansing meditation where I go through all of these colors. I could post it if you care to hear.

Ok, I want to know where chocolate fits in here. Brown??? kind of closest to the red perhaps.
<br>

Well, it's important!

<section>
i've seen at least four or five different color schemes for chakras in the bookstore.  in the chakra section there are many books w/ illustrations on the front showing what colors represent which body part.  i've read that those colors aren't the actual colors of the chakras and they are shown like that to produce certain effects in our consciousness.  thinking about different colors  and patterns affects our consciousness in different ways.  i don't know which colors to believe are where becasue of all of the selection.  it makes me think that none of them are right.

<section>
Well I think in terms of vibrational rate, with red being the most and indigo/violet being the last (since the crown is more of an opening to the universal energy conduit other than chakra) it is almost like the evolution colours throughout the body represent different levels of being. I think it also largely has to do with Aura's as well.
<br>
<br>
I can see aura's pretty good, and colors tend to be about general things that are common to chakra's. But of course that is my opinion, and I would say find out for yourself to be satisfied.

I think all fruits are good and need to be eaten...well, I mean at least a good balance of variety.
<br>
<br>
Some info:
<br>
<br>
1. FRUITS
<br>
- Acid Fruit
<br>
<br>
oranges - pineapples - sour apples - sour plums - lemons - grapefruits - sour peaches - limes - tangerines - sour grapes - tomatoes
<br>
These are the most detoxifying fruits and excellent foods. They should be avoided when you have the flu because the body could overreact detoxifying and make you even more sick.
<br>
<br>
Some people may have problems with these fruits because of their acid content. The acid though is a healthy and organic nutritional element (for instance: ascorbic acid is vitamin c, found especially in citrus fruits and vegetables).
<br>
<br>
Sometimes one type of fruit from this category can irritate a particular part of the body. This can be caused by an allergic reaction caused by cowmilk. There is a good chance that after staying away from dairy this reaction disappears.
<br>
<br>
- Low-acid Fruit
<br>
<br>
apricots - blueberries - huckleberries - strawberries - nectarines - raspberries -  blackberries - gooseberries - mangos - elderberries - olives - fresh figs - sweet apples - cherries- sweet peaches - sweet plums - persimmons
<br>
These fruits are less detoxifying than acid fruits and can be handled well in any amount.
<br>
<br>
- Sweet Fruit
<br>
<br>
dates - sweet grapes - pears - prunes - raisins - dried figs
<br>
Rehydrate dried fruit by soaking it overnight in a jar of water.
<br>
<br>
- Melons
<br>
<br>
watermelons - cantaloupes - honey dew - galia
<br>
Are like all other fruits excellent food. What's very special about watermelons is that they contain as much iron as spinach. Eat as much of them as you like.
<br>
<br>
- Starchy Fruit
<br>
<br>
bananas - peanuts - pumpkins - winter squashes
<br>
Could work as a fattener but are always better than foods from the wrong nutrition list. Don't eat more than one banana a day if you gain weight easily.
<br>
<br>
- Non-starchy Fruit
<br>
<br>
cucumber - sweet pepper - zuchini - egg plant - yellow squash
<br>
- Protein containing Fruit
<br>
