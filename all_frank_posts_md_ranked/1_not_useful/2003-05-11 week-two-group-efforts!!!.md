11-05-2003 Sunday
<br>
It was Mothers Day.
<br>
We went to grandma.
<br>
I was in a good mood. Looking at a picture of a kid somewhere in LA kissing with someone older, some slut, I realised again we can never judge.
<br>
We went walking in the neighborhood.
<br>
After a while we saw some Turkish people toegteher, it was a mosk.
<br>
Someone from then beckoned us, he knew I was interested I guess. J
<br>
It was a yearly bazaar. There were very nice breads and cakes for sale.
<br>
I Loved the Place. I got into some state of Joy, religious flow.
<br>
I wrote down when going in the guestbook 'I love Islam'.
<br>
We bought slippers and a sunglass in the bazaar. (which is usually the prayer-room)
<br>
I still had the same feeling when, 4 hours later, we were driving back home.
<br>
It was a feeling which I knew was located in my heart chakra. At least that's where I felt it most.
<br>
I live Turkish people, we also got some folders about turkey, the pictures of a Turkish café seems very attractive. Pillows and a waterpipe.
<br>
too bad the waterpipe doesn't contain the stuff I want.
<br>
Islam rules. J
<br>
<br>
12-05-2003 Monday
<br>
I woke up. I know I've dreamt. But I can't remember, I do know that before going to bed I was planning to get the Turkish feeling back, and I tried thinking about Islam.
<br>
<br>
Take Care.

  1.Interesting experience with the candle Kenny. So when you were going through these emotions it just perked up all on it's own???
  <br>
  <br>
  2.And great progress with your ability to focus!!!  You're growing in leaps and strides. I too find it a challenge to stay in awareness all the time. Practice.  *shrugs*

Also the picture I posted of the pyramids, the one with a dark pyramid with the purple sun behind it, looked the same as my
<br>
ehm ,alter (don't know what to call it), 3 crystal balls formed a pyramid, with the indigo one on the top (place of third eye) and behind that a candle within a purple glass.
<br>
Just like in the picture is a purple sun. I tto focused on that picture trying to get to Gizeh in some form.

2.Yes, It is difficult, I have problems stopping thinking. fortunately I had a nice Flow experience after a visit to a turkish mosk-bazaar. A Flow which was the result of thinking and feeling like God and a moslimwarrior for God.

The other morning I placed an Intent to focus on this group. Tried to encapsulate Adrian's notion of a meeting-place and this group-effort thread. Which was a tad unclear to say the least. I was about to move on after getting nowhere (which didn't surprise me as these things can take a while to gain a tangible presence) but then I distinctly heard either a young male or perhaps a female voice calling, Frank! Frank! Frank! And that was it.

I got all the files from the Mysticweb Ap course the last time it ran but never practised any of the exercises.This time round, while not in the course as such, I am using the lectures as I would recieve them, with a new one every
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///friday.today" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Friday.Today
</a>
being Monday, I am on the fouth day of week two.
<br>
<br>
Every night since Friday I have been using the technique recommended, focusing on the heart. Every night so far I have been entering trance and experiencing exit sensations.Hopefully it will not be long before I "get out" again.
<br>
<br>
I find this technique effective because you cant try too hard at it. Its all about focus. Couple that with intent and results should soon follow.
<br>
<br>
Great job Darryl with creating and maintaining motivation.

May success come to all who seek it.

Heres the rest of my journal for now.
<br>
still 12/5
<br>
13 o'clock.
<br>
Had to work in the greenhouse. Was very energetic, at least I did not feel like stopping with working.
<br>
The trainer called me persistent when I rolled the watercable back onto the ehm... thing it belonged to. Damn what a censored job that is.
<br>
With swimming class I didn't get really tired like usual, I had plenty of energy after doing my become-aware-of-your-body-exercise. I recommend that to everybody, you can't get OoBE when you are not aware of your body (and with it your emotions r other parts of your soul.)
<br>
I didn't feel tired when going back home like usual.
<br>
<br>
<br>
At dinner I had artguments with my parents about Islam again, I was watching a documentary about someone in Iran who killed 16 prostitutes and felt something good for both the killer and the victims. the killer didn't think of himself as a killer, he wanted to exterminate an immoral thing in his society.

well I'm pretty down today....
<br>
reason?
<br>
because my method isnt working.
<br>
I usually switch out the lights, relax in my chair, play some relaxing music and let it flow through me... however it is'nt working, I get the tingling sensation, and then, for one reason or another, my eyes open, its really wierd, its like I do my usual excersizes and then it just doesnt work and I have to try again, this is really anoying, so could people please post how to try another method? I would like to try the rope method if someone knows it so, if you wouldnt mind posting it, much obliged.

This Pyramids meeting on Saturday night Is a good idea. I'm getting a strong vibe that Somebody will make it there this week.
<br>
Anyway I'm practicing both yoga and pranayama (breath control) again on a regular basis. Maybe this will help to promote or induce a projection. Hope to 'see' y'all soon.

And here's the next part of my journal:
<br>
<br>
13-05-2003 Tuesday
<br>
I cannot remember any dreams.
<br>
I was not as aware of my body and mind as usual (which is even usually not much)
<br>
but I worked good without stopping.
<br>
I tried meditating/achieving some inner harmony and peace before lunch with help of my Tibetan sound Bells (hm, bells, whats the name of those half sphere like things that produce high frequency sound?) but as expected I was mocked and interrupted by those misunderstanding unbelieving idiots.
<br>
during lunch I heard one of my trainers, Nathalie van Baal, was pregnant for 13 weeks already!
<br>
Perhaps something for the helaing forum, send her and her baby positive energy people.
<br>
I got a cmpliment that I was very awake during work in the kitchen.
<br>
After dinner I got neck pain and visualised my 5t chakra rotating clockwise and radiating skye light, the pain was gone for moments but it returned later, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.
<br>
Before sleeping I had some thoughts about wether or not there were racial differences.
<br>
I think god wouldn't create races just to make them psychologically equal. However when I thouhgt something about slavery damn It felt like someone broke a muscle in my leg and I couldn't even walk right when I got up the next morning. [
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
]
<br>
When the pain was gone however, still before going to sleep, It felt quite the opposite, very pleasurable. maybe cuz of endorphins release or so. Or a strong blood flow to my leg.
<br>
<br>
14-05-2003 Wednesday
<br>
I woke up. Can't remember dreams.
<br>
I fell back asleep.
<br>
Now I dreamt I was 7 years old and my dad was punishing me for smoking pot during weekly days, my mother was there too, I hated her for some reason, apparently, just like in some past lives I remember she was the real cause of my bad behaviour.
<br>
Hope the dream doesn't apply to this world.
<br>
Anyway I begged my father not to lock me up (which was the punishment that he wanted to give me in the dream, normally he rarely punishes.) and cried out of pain,fear and sadness something like hate for my mother. But It wasn't hate.
<br>
That's all I remember.
<br>
<br>
Went through the day very good.
<br>
Worked just fine.
<br>
<br>
When the taxi was driving me home I put my mothers Tibetan soun CD on again and I reached a nice peace, somewhat like conscious sleep. Its great meditating while you are in a car. I got home like I rested for a night.
<br>
At home I watched part of a documentary about Mohammed, prophet of Islam. And now I am writing this. [

</blockquote>
<br>
None in specific.  I am trying many times to become aware of my body,
<br>
becoming aware of me being in my head and spreading my consciousness to my other parts of the body+realising the function of every limb and organ. (for example:the legs to make cntact with earth and live on it, the right arm as the tooluser (left brain hemisphere) etc.
<br>
And I try visualising chakra's, which includes the heartbeat-exercise from last weeks course post.
<br>
[Edit:Breathing Awareness and Relaxation is an obvious things which I have to do before and during those exercises.
<br>
And I write down dreams, hope that might help me remembering dreams and maybe getting lucid. Interesting thing, someone from a dutch forum (kontradix or Wilco, you've met him on MSN) says he dreamt about me in April, he PM-ed me on

Still, Its difficult to plan, I wish I was in some kind of buddhist or christian monestary, that would work a lot better planning than this life in this house with this daily activity. [

Hm, yesterday I forgot to post a moontopic because my dad wanted to write something and I had to hurry.
<br>
And today I wanted to open that topic (it is 7:45 in the morning here)
<br>
and I can't even find back my own post about the moon in one of the group effort topics. [

Small  Journal Update.
<br>
<br>
15/5 not much to tell, just listened to the tibetan sound cymbal Cd in the train and did the usual exercises spread through the day
<br>
like becoming aware of my body, feeling how me is being spreading out from my head, like the nervous system.
<br>
<br>
16/5
<br>
I wanted to write down my dream but forgot. sigh.
<br>
I just had to go to the bathroom and had a real sickness like pain in my guts and had to the bathroom, there I held my hand on that place, visualised white energy +love flowing into my guts and the pain was gone in an instant.
<br>
If even I can do that... People are unaware of their own power. [

The Turn Around
<br>
Week 10, Day 68, Session 135- PM1.10
<br>
Wednesday, May 14, 2003, 10:57 PM
<br>
<br>
Ok. Now I practice... now I succeed. I have added a new section to my Projection Model.
<br>
<br>
-   Opening: Ask help of Wuatun; Physical body stretch
<br>
-   Magnetization: Intent to separate and roll out, then consciously reenter
<br>
-   Warm-up: Focusing on my third eye, ten minutes
<br>
-   Energy work: As desired
<br>
-   Positioning: Deep relaxation
<br>
-   Separation: Letting go
<br>
-   Displacement: Roll out
<br>
-   Reentry: Manual reentry
<br>
<br>
Start: 11:05 PM
<br>
<br>
Alarm: 6:00 AM
<br>
<br>
6:37 AM
<br>
I ended at about 6:30 AM. GREAT practice. I didn't realize fully how much I needed to stretch. It really helps the practice, not being so tight. And I was really tight. I must add stretching daily.
<br>
<br>
I didn't remember to stretch to step 4, and I went back and stretched.
<br>
<br>
I continued through the sequence of exercises and got to the Warm-up. I was sitting for meditation as my warm-up and a few seconds into the meditation I felt myself turn around. At the start of meditation I kind of abruptly turned the opposite way from where I always face, towards my computer. But I faced the other way as a last moment decision to have this practice. It just felt right to turn the other way. Then, seconds later, after I closed my eyes and started my meditation, my nonphysical-self turned to face my computer, so that I was looking at my computer screen. It was really hazy, but I was really facing my computer and I know that I turned the opposite way, facing into the room, so it was very confusing. I didn't expect that.
<br>
<br>
I probably could have moved into real time. My physical eyes were closed, AND I was facing the other way, yet I could see the computer and I felt myself to be sitting in my chair and facing the computer. In my confusion I questioned where I was actually facing, and I kind of caused the turn-around thing to happen again so that I was facing the way my physical body was.
<br>
<br>
Note to self: Woo hoo!
<br>
<br>
Afterthoughts:
<br>
<br>
* When movement happens, consider it separation and move.
<br>
<br>
* For about 8 minutes total I focused on my third eye for the warm-up.
<br>
<br>
* This really worked, though I didn't mean cause it. On intuition I turned the oppisite way, and out of habit I nonphysically turned to face the computer. This is interesting. I've separated before by lying down with my head the oppisite way than usual, and then imagining myself to be lying the way I normally do. [

Yes. This is, and 'I'm the Man' moment. [:O]
<br>
<br>
And Nay!

Woo hoo!

Thank you! You're welcome! And...

Much Success to you too!!! [

Sure I would go to week 3
<br>
<br>
<br>
16/5
<br>
Went to bed and put the Tibetan meditation Cd on.
<br>
I relaxed and went to sleep.
<br>
I used the fingerpulling exercise once or twice, hope I can remember to watch every 15 minutes to pull my fingers and be aware.
<br>
<br>
17/5
<br>
I dreamt. Vague, can only remember how astral it felt. Emotional, vague,spiritual, right brain experience,
<br>
<br>
Meditated in pyama at my desk on the Tibetan Sound Cymbal CD
<br>
Very good. Makes me aware and peaceful at the same time.
<br>
Just before watching the clock I now (50 minutes later still playing CD,) got an image of the clock, it was correct (8:23)
<br>
I also tried to get the Cd player on when it couldn't read the CD.
<br>
visualising to be the laser and the minidisk

Maybe I
<i>
 again
</i>
aimed to start a group effort expecting more of an active response than I should have. It seems better to just post as normal, as it doesn't seems that such a coherent effort will be had with but a handful of people, which depredicates the term Group Effort. Therefore I go back to posting as normal, as this will take less of my energy to do, and I can still inspire people.
<br>
<br>
Till my next post.
<br>
<br>
PS
<br>
I'm still going for Giza every Saturday. I'll just post that as normal too, should I have something to post. [

<br>
I got walking when mom asked me to, we went to the forest, however I got less awareness than usual as I I lived in the mmist. I still tried to connect with the trees and be as aware as possible.
<br>
At 3:15 local time,when I was long home,
<br>
I meditated with closed curtains and incense and calamus.
<br>
I meditated on Gizeh and sweet_celestial_sounds but also just becoming aware and
<br>
visualising white light to heal me, which usually works,especially if I can send love and peace with the light.
<br>
I got somewhat harmonised but I have had better days.
<br>
Later I went taking a shower. I went into the room after coming from the toilet and saw my moms prediction-cards lying where they always are, with one turned around.
<br>
I thought by myself that what I would read could be my lesson for now.
<br>
It said 'Patience' I of course agree wholeheartedly, since I feel like trapped in time, patience is the thing I need to have.
<br>
<br>
See ya.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmm, want to stop the group effort? Why? Two weeks isn't much time, if we continue this group for much longer maybe we will attract people who are willing to go for it. [

Sure, I'll participate in a Week 3 experiment. So far I've had no great success. Just a few wierd, dimly remembered dreams and one lucid dream. That might be a positive sign though because wierd dreams sometimes are a prelude to an OBE??[?]

hey im in for a week three. i missed the first two because i have not been exploring this site like i should be.
<br>
<br>
i feel im on the verge of separation but some inner anxieties are holding me back.
<br>
<br>
my last four tries at an obe wound up in lucid dreams.(i think) i could control my self and couldnt get over flying. thats all i seemed to be able to focus on.
<br>
<br>
i am trying to achieve scientific results by visiting someone far away from me and being able to tell them what they are wearing. my last attempt worked for my location result but i was wrong on the clothes. is this kind of detail possible during an obe?
