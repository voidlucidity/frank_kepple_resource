First, a bit of information on my abilities. I have been training for many months now for telekinesis about 1 hour per day and having no results (but I feel closer of having some) and have no abilities so far.
<br>
<br>
After reading the last post of AuraMassageArt, I had an idea. I know that one of the most difficult thing about learning new abilities is probably to find the motivation and time to train. Most of us, like I, are completly new to all this stuff and we train the way a blind baby would learn to walk.
<br>
<br>
My idea is that I think it would dramaticly help the community if someone trustable (maybe moderator or designed teacher) could post gradual exercices starting from the very basic to later been able to move objets. This would be better in many ways than the 'learn by yourself' way which we all already have tried. (For my part, I have already read all the psypog articles, and many others..).
<br>
<br>
For example, the (let's call him/her Master) could post a basic exercice to start with and give us a week to succeed doing it. It would be described in a way that we'll know what it should be, what we should feel in our bodies, in our heads, what to expect, what to think of, the feelings we might feel, everything that could lead us to succeed in the exercice.
<br>
<br>
What's good in this is that thoses who can't succeed will reply and tell what they felt, what they were thinking while trying, etc.. and those who succeeded will be able to help them. By comparing each others feelings, techniques, etc.. and starting with basics exercices I think it would be easier for everyone to get on the right track faster.
<br>
<br>
Once the delay over, all who succeeded in the first exercice could go on to the second, and so on until a new ability is learned. Then a 'rank' (it is Â motivating even if meaningless) could be giving to all who have succeeded.
<br>
<br>
Having many others trying to succeed in a same exercice will create a kind of competition and will have 'students' pass more time training because we'll want to be able to do the next exercice.
<br>
<br>
Once everyone gets good enough, the kind of 'guess what's in front on my computer' exercice could be very interesting and fun. Maybe we could organize a rl community competition once a year.
<br>
<br>
It's hard to express myself english, but I think you got the overall idea. It does not demand a lot of preparation, only someone with strong abilities, good at expressing and describing and willing to create and write a new exercice once a 'week'. His/her work ends here, it's up to the 'students' to help each others.
<br>

What you say makes a lot of sense but I think maybe not all that many people are interested in the Telekinesis side of things. This forum, as a whole, is more to do with astral projection. But I wish you every success.

Yours,
