Hi all
<br>
<br>
(Sorry for my poor English)
<br>
<br>
The people with strong alpha waves during relaxation will never experience OOB. They consist of approx. 65 % of population.  The strength of alpha doesn't allow them to reach the sufficent depth of mental and physical relaxation. They are of course relaxed but not the way they should be for extraordinary experience.
<br>
<br>
Approx. 15 % of adults shows quite strong theta and weak alpha.  These are the folks who if try are successul with all the Monroe tapes (hemis-sync) light and sound machines, floatation tanks and so forth.
<br>
<br>
I hope you are in the second group so you don't waste your money and don't get frustrated for lack of results with the tapes and mind machines.
<br>
If you are in the first group, well, just follow the hype and try and try and try.
<br>
Good luck
<br>
<br>
Jan
<br>
<br>
<br>
ps.
<br>
The other 20 % are classified into other groups.
<br>

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
Everyone expereinces all frequencies during a typical day from beta through to delta. To get to delta you need to pass through theta.
<br>
<br>
It is all a matter of balance. I should think that everyone has a predominent frequency, but it is quite possible by means of meditation, hemi-sync etc. to re-progam your brain rythms to particular frequencies.
<br>
<br>
To say that people get stuck in alpha makes no sense to me, and everyone leaves their body every night in delta anyway.
<br>

Yes, Tom, you are right in 100 %, we all will eventually die and cross over to the astral realms.
<br>
<br>
Didn't you ever wonder that few folks have a super extra experiences no matter what tape or mind machine they try while others struggle for long time and either give up or continue the chase.
<br>
Those few talented folks write all the wonderful messages and descriptions of their experiences while hundreds or thousands get almost nothing but hope.  The hundreds get very excited by what they read and hear but they are poor folks - they can't experience it themselves.
<br>
<br>
I am not a scientist and I wish I am damn wrong and you are right.

<br>
<br>
Yes, we all go to sleep and are mainly in delta.
<br>
We all go through day and are mainly in beta plus other freqencies.
<br>
We all can relax, to some degree - and some people show strong alpha during relaxation while others just theta as dominant force or almost the dominant.
<br>
Just get hooked up to an EEG while listening to a tape or mind machine. You will see what I mean.
<br>
<br>
My friend has quite strong theta during rest, when he is hooked up to mind machine you can easily see how the graphs representing his brainwaves change. They are "combed" very quickly into a nice small pattern around 4 or 5 herz and he reports incredible visuals or feeling vibrations.
<br>
Myslef have strong alpha - I can spend 2 hours listening to a tape and nothing takes place. Of course, I am relaxed. But I can relax also watching a good movie - this is not a big deal. The graphs representing my brainwaves are altered a little bit but only a little bit. They usually drop from 10 herz to 8 herz. But this is not sufficient for OOBE.  You need 4 or 5 or even as low as 3 herz, or combination of these low frequencies.
<br>
<br>
We have different brain patterns, even those who are so successul with the tapes and mind machines. But did you ever notice that some people have more interesting experience with one Focus state than the other ?
<br>
Some folks prefer Focus 12 others Focus 10 etc.
<br>
These Focus levels have different combination of frequencies - if your natural freq. during rest is close to Focus 12 you will have more of it than from any other Focus level.
<br>
For good results with the higher Focus you need also the very very high frequencies, above 50 or 100 herz. This is very unusual combination of freq. for example 4 herz and 200 herz in the same time !
<br>
But these experiences are also very unusual.

Actually, I was thinking about death. It is odd to see my thoughts in writing after I refused to speak them. There have been projections for me, though, over my now 14 year struggle. They were rare exceptions to some rule or another. Other abilities are not so slow in coming. I think that what is needed is for more of these people of natural talent to come out and teach the rest of us in person.

<section>
Greetings!
<br>
<br>
I don't believe that people' s brainwaves get stuck in one frequency or another while relaxing.
<br>
<br>
Sure, some will have a tendency towards alpha, and some towards theta. Those that are on the theta side are fortunate.
<br>
<br>
However, there is no doubt that daily meditation will re-sync your brainwaves in a more relaxed state towards theta and even upper delta. This needs to be proper trance meditation however, with vacancy of mind, and be carried out every day if possible for up to a couple of hours. I am not a Buddhist, but I know that Zen style meditation is good for this.
<br>
<br>
Likewise with the hemi-sync CD's - they will connect up both hemi-spheres of the brain and enable theta to be reached much more easily. I am sure that the hemisphereical connectivity of the brain is a big part in determining the predominent and progressive frequencies achievable.
<br>
<br>

<section>
I don't know a whole lot about the brainwave frequencies, and how they can restrict a person from OBE'ing.  However, I'm a firm believer that whatever your dominate brainwave frequency is, if you can at least remember your dreams, than you are *capable* of having an OBE/AP.  Period.
<br>
<br>
In order for a person to recollect those memories when you're physical body is unconscious shows me that they possess the *tools* to one day become AWARE thatthey are dreaming....and that can be a platform to jump into a projection.

If you need an excellent program for inducing different wave states...
<br>
<br>
I have used the following 2...
<br>
Flasher, which is a DOS program and very good in that it flashes to induce the alpha,beta.theta or delta wave state you want to get into.
<br>
It can be found at:
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.parabox.net/eye-candy/FLASHER.exe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.parabox.net/eye-candy/FLASHER.exe
</a>
<br>
***there is a warning not to use if susceptable to epilepsy***
<br>
<br>
And for sound waves, an excellent program might be found here at:
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.bwgen.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.bwgen.com
</a>
<br>
<br>
Both are excellent programs, however, Flasher can only be used on WIN98 or prior as it is a DOS proggie, and I haven't take the time to see if I can somehow get it to run with WinXP properly. I believe if you make a boot up disk with it, and go to generic DOS, (if possible with XP), then you can run it fine...
<br>
<br>
Have fun with both...

do you NEED headphones for the brainwave generator ? I mean ..

Also .. marty , which preset gave you the vibrations man ? I've heard of people trying to put these sounds on a CD but is that possible ? Cause i know they loop. How would you listen to them and get the vibrations sitting uncomfortably like it do lol

<section>
Ah, yes headphones are a huge requirement otherwise you might as well listen to the fridge. it plays two different frequencies in to each ear which create the binaural beats or something, I dunno, it works thats all that matters. Yes they can be burned to cd, but it's a pain! You need the latest version of the program to make the wave files any longer than a minute, which, is crap, coz i've only got 3.1.2.
<br>
<br>
Do you have the program. It has to be registered if you want to import presets such as this. If you do go here:

<br>
<br>
Download the one called Deep Mind IV. You've gotta be comfy, I lie down on my bed and use it.
<br>
<br>
If you dont have the program, register it. If you can't afford it, there are other ways, which involve bending the rules a little. I'll tell you if you want but after that it's in your hands and has nothing to do with me. Also, fredhed, the same thought had occured to me.

For the Flasher program OahnMacleod mentioned, you can have it run in XP by right clicking on the prgram, clicking compatability, then choose campatability with Windows 98. Should work, if not, then cry.

fredhedd asked:
<br>
"napolean, who are you and where did you get those figures? what study and where and who were the people that were tested? what do you have to back up what you are saying?"
<br>
<br>
I like this question.
<br>
There were some small "studies" done by several of the mind machines/tapes designers/producers.  The users asked why they don't get the colorful visual effects and the OOBE while some other users seems get it quite easy.
<br>
The explanation given was: their natural dominant frequency of brainwaves during rest was merely in alpha (between 12 and 8 herz).  When the mind machine or the tape played signal 4 herz  (for inducing OOBE)  the brain didn't respond to it at all.
<br>
So no visuals, no vibes no OOBE.
<br>
<br>
People with strong alpha freq. need a special aproach, special training to "fool" their brains, to trick it, so the alpha is weakened and then can take place the so called Frequency Following Response. With weaker alpha the brainwaves are more flexible, it easier to "pull them down" from alpha to theta and even into delta.  The flexibility of the brainwaves - and not the rigidity - is a must for everyone seriously interested in mind machines and OOBE.
<br>
<br>
I think even The Monroe Institute wrote about this problem (too strong natural alpha as obstacle for OOBE) in one of their research papers. I have to look into my papers and maybe on the next weekend I will give you some details.
<br>
<br>
The importance of weakening the alpha to make the brain more flexible and more willing to follow the binaural beat stimulation also described Mr Len Ochs. I don't remember exactly but he has his own strategy on alpha and is quite successful.
<br>
<br>
How successful in weakening the alpha are all the tapes and mind machines and each of them specifically I don't know - never saw any research.
<br>
Obviously many of them don't do it, maybe few does....
<br>
But to weaken the strong alpha is more difficult than stop smoking - is just there, period. I met many people using mind machines or tapes but only 3 of them experienced OOB.
<br>
Mayabe it impress some of you but not me
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
)
<br>
<br>
Probably the best way to experience OOB is to spend some time in Monroe Institute in their dark, isolated chambers for many many hours. But even there less than half of the folks experience OOB, if I remember it correctly, have to check next weekend.

That sounds like a great experience, and could easily lead to OBE!
<br>
<br>
Which BWGEN pre-set did you use?
<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that the reason some people experience alpha more readily than theta is due to the way that the left and right hemi-spheres of the brain work together. Brainwave-entrainment like Monroe and BWGEN will, when used enough times, synchronise the left and right spheres of the brain, and bring about the possibility of going down to theta almost at will.
<br>
<br>
That is why those with natural tendency towards alpha should not give up, but do regular meditation and/or hemi-synch training.

i agree with napoleon on a thing: i believe that there is a minority of people who have a capacity to project and there are a majority who doesnt. ive worked hard for months dedicating hours and hours of meditation and energy work (even with symbols of reiki) and i havent got anything. just some times to get my body numbed, and nothing else.

Greetings everyone,
<br>
<br>
I deemed this important enough to consult Robert Bruce for hos opinions. Robert is truly an expert at these things through many years of dedication.
<br>
<br>
Brian, who Robert refers to, is Robert's co-author for his forthcoming new Astral/OBE book.  Here is what Robert says:
<br>
<br>
<i>
 "First and foremost, these percentages appear to have been drawn from a very
 <br>
 small sample of the population, and are admittedly 'small studies'.  More
 <br>
 research would most definitely be required before these stated percentages
 <br>
 could be used to pose more than a hypothetical argument.  However, if the
 <br>
 research has some merit and only 35% of the population are capable of theta
 <br>
 and obe, that is quite a high average in itself.  But the 65% who have
 <br>
 strong natural resistance to theta and OBE can still, I think, train their
 <br>
 brains to be more flexible.  Once trained, they would be more susceptible to
 <br>
 artificial trance inducing aids.  I have never come across any person who,
 <br>
 if they worked at it in the long term, could not accomplish full theta
 <br>
 trance and OBE. They might have to work at this for much longer than the
 <br>
 lucky 35%, but it can be done.  Brian, my coauthor, is a shining example of
 <br>
 this. Brian is probably one of the 65%, but he has really worked at it and
 <br>
 has for some time been succeeding at OBE, LD, and even WILD."
</i>
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps people out this into perspective.
<br>
<br>
This re-nforces my own view that people are born with, or have developed, distinct differences in the way both hemi-spheres of the brain work together - the more they work together, the deeper theta obtainable in general terms. That being the case, the brain can be trained to work optimally, but it will take some time and effort. The effort is well worthwhile.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
Alpha waves are common. Close your eyes and you will have them, generally. The state of mind they are associated with is relaxed and yet alert, but not lost in thought or activity like the beta of most waking life. It can have bursts of theta and usually does when it is continued for some time. Zen meditation is usually done with the eyes open, and over time they develop alpha frequencies with the eyes open. It is more important that the alpha waves develop over several areas at once and that the left and right hemispheres becomes synchronized. Theta is deeper and slower than alpha. It is more introspective. It has a greater degree of imagery. It is here that spontaneous imagery, such as hypnagogic imagery, is allowed to develop. This is highly unusual for me. I tend to sit in the alpha no matter how deeply I relax. Either that or I fall asleep. Hypnagogic imagery is highly unusual to me.

In 1970s and 1980s there was a growing popularity of mind machines, extraordinary tapes and so forth.
<br>
The designers/producers of these wonders claimed that their devices would help you with easy and effortless OOB, remote viewing, learn 100 or 500 foreign words within one session and so forth.
<br>
There were statements that such tapes and machines will be in every school so the kids will become super-students - relax in 10 minutes and 500 words learned within next 20 minutes. I was convinced and enthiusiastic.
<br>
Thirty years passed and there is less mind machines and tapes than it was before. Few schools used the tapes, few individuals exoerienced OOB and even fewer developed Remote Viewing but thousands paid their hard earned money for keeping the hope alive.
<br>
Ever wonder why it happened as it happened ?
<br>
<br>
There are folks who tried 100 or 200 times with various CDs and tapes and nothing really happened, except some mediocre sensations.  I have better sensations after beer,
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I am not saying that all the tapes / mind machines are wothless, probably not.
<br>
But I wish that instead of some very general and vague claims they would say the following:
<br>
"- Out of 100 folks who listened to my tape 80 reached the theta state and therefore I named it "The Theta Tape"
<br>
But no, they are very quiet, it is safer for them from economical point of view to say: just listen to our tape one time or few times and you get "IT".
<br>
Eventually if you don't get it after 100 times you can  try 100 more times ... or buy another tape
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
And the best hit is to have a "feedback" on the front page from someone who was successul with such tape. Then if you are not successul you blame yourself instead of the producer. You think why he got something and not you, it must be something wrong with you, you are the failer and other crap. Just stop and think: maybe not you but this product is crap.
<br>
If they this product is so effective why they have the "feedback" from somebody signed with initials instead of the results of a research ?
<br>
<br>
(Sorry for my poor English, I hope you understand)
<br>
<br>
I wish you an easy OOBs or prolific astral sex.
<br>
Whatever.

<section>
I think most of us are doing our projection exercises with closed eyes. We are not picturing or trying to see anything, either. Most of the techniques discussed here seem to focus on creating and recreating tactile sensations, just as with the NEW system. Closing the eyes causes alpha waves to be produced. Excessive thinking can keep the brain stuck in beta waves, but that is easy enough to avoid. Going to theta seems to be a sort of letting go, just as going to alpha requires letting go of quite so much thinking. Exactly what must be let go of and how awareness is to be sustained is unknown to me. The silva mind control system, which speaks of alpha and theta, seems to suggest it is just a matter of practice.

What if the frequency of the brain has nothing to do with astral projection? What if it were some other factor?
<br>
<br>
The masters all trained for many years to be able to achieve these trance states, what if they used methods other than deep brain relaxation? What do successful 'travellers' do that is not just relaxation?
<br>
<br>
I suspect that astral travel and OOB involves increasing ones chi or kundalini, raising ones vibrations to a higher level. Does that mean that their brain emitts theta and delta frequencies or does that involve beta and alpha or a mixture? What if it involves increasing chi to the chakras instead? I just don't know.

One of the most important aspects of projection is the "body asleep" state, so that consciousness can dissociate from the  physical body. This is the process that occurs naturally every night during sleep, but in Astral projection we need to keep the mind awake to take control.
<br>
<br>
Please note, that it is the body that is relaxed, and not the brain which needs to have full control over the situation.
<br>
<br>
There is little doubt that vital energy and vibrations can have a big effect on the projection of conscsiousness and subsequent control and memory, but the pre-requisite trance state comes before these in the sequence I think.

however it seems that napolean is being lynched slightly! he has made a series of valid comments. Surely the purpose of this forum is to provide a discussion area for projection and related topics, therefore comments such as those by Napolean can only improve our understanding of the subject matter? am I right, if you think differently please tell me because I'd like to hear your opinions

Of course Napolean is getting a negative reaction. The only thing worse here than saying 65% of the population can't learn astral projection is to say that it can't be done by anyone. I haven't learned to project yet, so I am watching this to see how to go from being in the 65% to joining the other 35%. That was accepted as a possibility, you know. That is a bit like saying instead that everyone can learn to project but first 65% of us might have to work at it to develop brainwave frequencies below the alpha range.

Hey folks, I am not expecting that everyone will agree or disagree with me.
<br>
I excpect that we can talk about some things. If you don't like what I am sharing with you - just don't read it. That's simple, right ?
<br>
But if you find something interesting on these topics please share with me and others here on the forum.
<br>
The importance of alpha and the switch into theta is the crucial one in OOBE, hypnosis, self-hypnosis, Silva Mind Control, and many others.
<br>
Theta activity and its strength during rest is strongly and positively related to hypnotic susceptibility, flexibility of the brain and is the most consistent EEG correlate of experiencing extraordinary states , incl. OOBEs.
<br>
Several studies have reexamined these relationships based on rigorous subject screening and control, along with enhanced recording and analytic techniques.  Several researchers , Cutcomb, Crawford, and Pribram (1990) found highly hypnotizable persons to generate substantially more theta during rest than did low hypnotizable subjects during resting baseline.
<br>
The position which is most supported in the contemporary literature is a consistent pattern of EEG activity which can differentiate individuals according to their brainwaves scores.
<br>
<br>
This baseline individual difference is an important neuropsychophysiological indicator of hypnotizability and flexibility of the brain.

Greetings Napolean!
<br>
<br>
This is all very well and good, but these are just random samples.
<br>
<br>
Everyone will have different
<b>
 initial
</b>
brainwave characteristics to start with, due e.g to lifestyle, and particularly sodium/pottasioum levels in the brain. Also such things as caffeine intake, smoking, alcohol and numerous other things will make a difference from person to person.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 However
</b>
, people can alter their base brainwave level by addressing the above factors, and also by meditation, use of e.g. BWGEN etc..
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce tells me that hs has never known anyone fail to OBE sooner or later with practice and dedication.
<br>
<br>
Please watch what you are dogmatically claiming here - it is only a fraction of the complete truth, and it might discourage people unecessarily. The fact is, taking a snapshot from the street, as opposed to a long term Astral projection training are two entirely different things.

Hello Adrian,
<br>
<br>
What I am expecting from you guys is some documented research, some checked results and so forth. Rather than: I don't believe you, you are destroying my hopes, you are dogmatic, and so forth. Hey, calm down a little bit. I am not a researcher, not a scientist, so no need to feel threatened by what I am saying.
<br>
<br>
Adrian wrote about "iinitial brainwave characteristics to start with, due e.g to lifestyle, and particularly sodium/pottasioum levels in the brain."
<br>
But I am not talking about initial brainwave characteristic but about something much more stronger and more stable and called The Brainware Signature.
<br>
Each of us has his own unique BRAINWAVE SIGNATURE - and this is not based on a "snapshot from the street" as Adrian described but on very long research done by Anna Wise. She is probably one of the top experts in the world on EEG, brainwaves and altered states of mind. There is her book on
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.amazon.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.amazon.com
</a>
and is FASCINATING to read
<br>
(details about brainwaves, trainings,
<br>
brainwaves during OOBs,
<br>
brainwaves during samadhi states or religion extasy,
<br>
Zen monks' brainwaves,
<br>
catholic priests' brainwaves during prayer,
<br>
 brainwaves of a kid who could see ghosts
 <br>
 and so forth)
 <br>
 <br>
 What I understand by saying that the 65 % (or so) of population will never experience OOB is this:  I assume that some small percentage from this group after the 300th attempt can get some results.
 <br>
 The rest of the folks in this group maybe will need 600 attempts before experiencing any results. So, from this point of view one can say that majority of people can experience "something".
 <br>
 But this is just a speculation from me. This is like saying: almost everybody can learn play piano but only very few will become real artists.
 <br>
 <br>
 You see, the vast majority of designers/producers of the mind machines and tapes didn't bother to do any research, not even a damn "snapshot from the street." That's the problem, at least for the few of us.

Hi, Napoleon, this time I will speak directly to you instead of about you. What most people here are forgetting is that we are not just a random sampling of a large population. The majority of people will not even try to learn astral projection. We have selected ourselves from that larger population, and so the numbers like 65% and 35% do not apply to us when those numbers are about the larger population group we come from. Even so, many of us still feel threatened by the idea because of doubts we carry about our own abilities. The ability to choose to try means we are more likely than average to be in the 35%. I am admitting that I am in the 65%. It is not a new admission, given that I have been trying since 1988. Somehow I am doing something wrong. What I want to know is this: what advice do you have for people like me to learn astral projection? Or, almost as good, is there something that people like me might be able to do better with alpha than the other 35% can do?

<br>
<br>
Well, I have been trying since 1990 ... and I am definitely in 65 % group, I have checked it on my EEG.
<br>
<br>
You wrote:
<br>
"Somehow I am doing something wrong."
<br>
<br>
In my opinion you doing fine, you need just help, the right help for those with rigid brainwaves and/or too strong alpha.
<br>
<br>
<br>
You:
<br>
"is there something that people like me might be able to do better with alpha than the other 35% can do?"
<br>
<br>
Definitely yes.
<br>
You can have strong alpha and try to strengthen theta in the same time. Your theta will PROBABLY never surpass your alpha but ... but if you have strong alpha + weaker theta (both synchronous) you can access the Zen monks meditative state, you can do self-healing or even try healing others.
<br>
After longer practice it can lead you toward astral realms in deep sense of these words. However the path is quite long.  To speed up this process you should either buy tapes with alpha freq. or get the brainwave generator and design the session yourself. Get the alpha synchronous first. Then add theta and run the two freq. simultanously. The problem with majority of tapes is: they go either directly or very quickly into theta. This is not for folks like me and you. We need a gradual approach, step by step, first higher alpha, then mid alpha, then deeper alpha and so forth.
<br>
Remember,
<br>
We are not the "fast-lane drivers" into the astral realm  as are those with stronger theta.
<br>
<br>
There are also other techniques, specifically design for those with rigid brainwaves/strong alpha. But I will not tell them as I don't want to fire all my ammo in the first exchange of fire
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
In my opinion you should first do some research on brainwaves, get some books, and the right tapes/eqipment and start. But again, small stapes and not a jump into very deeeep frequencies - which although are very attractive will bring you NO RESULTS for many many years.
<br>
<br>
If you have EEG just check what is your dominant frequency. Probably is about 10 herz....
<br>
Then get tape with this freq. or design your own program using this req.
<br>
Your brain will become familiar with this state and with sinchronisation. Then lower the treshold to 9.5 herz, experiment with this for a while, get familiar.
<br>
After time go to 9 herz or 8.5 - here you will experience nice body sensation or some visuals. Then add weak theta and let your brain get familiar with it.
<br>
With training you will be able to increase the theta...gradually while having alpha too.
<br>
With the very gradual strengthening of your weak theta your strong alpha will be softened and weaker. That's all you need man !
<br>
<br>
The other option is listening to the theta/delta tapes 800 times before somebody will tell you that you trying not hard enough.

<section>
Greetings Napoleon!
<br>
<br>
You still are still generalising far too much in my opinion
<br>
<br>
The brainwaves of each and every person vary during the day - probably considerably.
<br>
<br>
And I have consulted Robert Bruce on this discussion - Robert has helped
<b>
 thousands
</b>
of people over a great many years on OBE related subjects, and has quite literally seen every possible case. Robert clearly states that
<b>
 anyone
</b>
can OBE with practice - and Robert, above all, will know.
<br>
<br>
Sure, I would concede that some people have more natural tendencies than others, but like everything, if you practice enough you can get there.
<br>
<br>
Brainwave entrainment is progressive, and as far as I can tell it is permanent, and that is clearly an important factor to consider. Such entrainment can be accomplished through daily meditation and, for example BWGEN - which I believe is a very valuable tool for many people - probably the best overall brainwave entrainment tool there is - and free or nearly free.
<br>
<br>
Tom is also correct when he states that it is more likely to be the people that have these abilities,or latent abilities that will be drawn to it in the first place. The vast majority of mankind, as yet, has never heard of the Astral or OBE, much less sought the abilities. Universal laws are perfect because they were designed and created by perfection, and such laws take
<b>
 everything
</b>
into account.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<section>
It is not a matter of giving up to acknowledge that maybe, based on the way my brain is wired, it might be easier to work with energy and healing. It is a joy to not bash my head against a wall and wonder what is wrong with me when some things like astral projection take much longer than most people need. I still want astral projection and will not give up on trying. It helps to understand that there are ways to assist me and that choosing not to acknowledge that I need help will not make me feel better. 300 tries? 600? How about 3000? Maybe even 6000, and still not being there? What Napoleon is telling me is not that something is wrong with me or that I will never get there. Instead, what I am hearing is that I am okay and that there are tools out there more suited to me than all of those tools designed for the other 35%. It is true that Robert Bruce can teach anyone. We all acknowledge that. The difference is that for 35% of the population it will be easier for Robert Bruce to teach. The other 65% will need for Robert Bruce to spend more time and effort, but Robert Bruce can afford it. What I want is to know everything there is about that, and how to help myself.

Hello Adrian,
<br>
<br>
BWGEN as probably "the best overall brainwave entrainment tool there" ?
<br>
Hmm. I use it for 1 month, every single day, and had not one OOB.
<br>
Should I try it for 12 months more ?

I suspect your biggest block from OBE is not brainwaves, but your attitude.
<br>
<br>
In order to experience OBE you must approach it with a postive attitude. All I have seen from you is a negative attitude, and that is your problem I reckon.

From my perspective Napoleon is being more positive in attitude than most people I know. It is positive to be willing to change approaches when something is not working. The only problem (possibly) is the name of this thread. It is only people who have not accomplished astral projection and yet do not try other approaches whi will not never succeed. Unfortunately I cannot suggest a new title for the thread, one less confrontational.

Hi Jan....
<br>
<br>
Let me ask you, do you get frustrated watching "Cribs" or "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous?"
<br>
<br>
In those shows, we are shown how lavish and carefree the homes and lives of celebrities really are.......
<i>
 even though we may never actually attain that kind of status ourselves.
</i>
I'm sure you don't watch that show and get frustrated, do you?
<br>
<br>
However, it would be just as ridiculous for me to tell you, "Here is why you'll never be rich."  Sure, it may be a struggle to earn a 6 figure income, but would I discourage you from attaining that?  Of course not.  For some people, it's easier to earn a lot of money, because they have trained in their fields and professions for such a goal.
<br>
<br>
Others of us haven't had that much training, but we have seen poor people who have worked at what they love, gone to school to acquire the appropriate skills, and now we've seen them earn the 6 figure salary that they only dreamed about.  The only thing that kept them moving forward was the fact that they knew it was possible!
<br>
<br>
I don't need to explain the analogy and how it applies to those who would like to learn how to project......I can tell you're a smart individual and you can see the parallels that I'm drawing.
<br>
<br>
If I can reassure you of anything, it would be this.  I know that ANYONE can project,because I can do it!  I was just like so many of you out there who STRIVED to have one but nothing ever happened.  I can't explain why, all of the sudden, they started to occur with me one evening, but once they did, I knew that anything was possible.....and that if a moron like me could work at it and eventually do it, then you can too.  You just have to believe it's possible, no matter what you're head tells you otherwise.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Hi All,

<br>
I will start this as a new thread as this one is getting a bit long....Also, maybe people will lighten up a bit too?!?::

<br>
<br>
Napoleon, practising and achieving OOBE is hard enough without the threat of never sucessfully doing it.  What was the purpose of your thread? where is the constructive side to counter the negative? Do you realise that people want to do this so badly, they would stick thier head down the toilet an hour a day if they thought it would help.
<br>
<br>
We should disregard the research, it is a small study, and will not reflect true percentages. for those who are trying (but not yet succeeded)
<br>
<br>
When I first found out about AP, it was considered to be a massive occult phenominon and was not widely accepted on a scientific level, now everyone is talking about the scientific aspects, and forgetting the basic fundaments: AP is a privilidge and is a key to spiritual enlightenment that we should respect and keep in perspective.  If one never manages to project, the benefits of the meditation and preparation work are massive to our mental health, for that we should be grateful alone.
<br>
<br>
As an alternative to the BW generator, I have an astral.WAV file which I have paid $20 for.  Adrian, is there a possability of hosting such files and utilities here.  This would allow people to get even more from an already brilliant site.  I started a thread and offered people a copy of this, I have already had around 10 emails asking me to forward it on.

I think that Astral projection isnt just the ability of the few but everyone! we do it every night remember! All you need is the real belief that you can achieve it and you will. It worked for me (sort of) with my semi-concious projection and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I'll put this to you, I have never had any super human abilities or psychic powers but what i do have is a belief in the power of my brain, be it Muldoons crypto concious or subconcious or whatever you call it we have no Idea of what it can do yet!

Hi Jan....I'm glad to see that you're still keeping an open mind about it.  You know, the first time I had an OBE was when I stopped trying and just decided to go to sleep.  Ironic, huh?  Maybe you've already done this, but just tell yourself, "Ok Jan, for the next 7 days, I am NOT going to try and OBE.  I'll just read about them and hear from others, but when I lay down at night, I am just trying to go to sleep.  If I catch myself trying to do any techniques for the next 7 days, I will stop."
<br>

After all, if you're doing everything that you think is right and you're still not projecting, what could it hurt to try the complete opposite?

Greetings everyone!
<br>
<br>
Yes, it is the negativity this topic that is the main issue. As I mentioned before - in order to OBE you
<b>
 must
</b>
have a postive attitude towards it, otherwise your subconscious will stop you every time - no matter how hard or many times you try. You have to tell your subconscious that you will project, and go about it accordingly.
<br>
<br>
Here are another few words by Robert Bruce:
<br>
<br>
"
<i>
 a lot of controlled obe's were done under lab
 <br>
 conditions with a variety of volunteers, including Robert Monroe.  It was
 <br>
 found that the majority of successful obe's (projectors had to read random
 <br>
 numbers in another room) projected in a light alpha state, not a deep alpha
 <br>
 or theta state, ascertained by eeg readings and etc..   I think they had a
 <br>
 12 year old girl who got a 10 out of 10 success rate.
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
That speaks for itself.
<br>
<br>
The fact is -
<b>
 anyone
</b>
at all can succeed at the various forms of Astral projection, it just takes longer for those that are not naturally inclined, and also a
<b>
 positive attitude
</b>
, proper information, and lots of practice. It is however a progressive ability, and once learned can be reliable - so the effort is well worth it - what else is worth more effort?

Thanks for your kind offer! First and foremost you would need to check the copyright. I am not saying there is a problem with your file, but please realise that  I would never allow anything here that broke any laws.
<br>
<br>
If the copyright is OK we can do one of three things:
<br>
<br>
1) Create a section in the File library for you to upload the file to.
<br>
<br>
2) You can (and not many people realise this) attach it to a forum post. Yu should see an "Attach File" option under the message area when you post.
<br>
<br>
3) I will place it on the server for people to download with their browsers.
<br>
<br>
Please let me know what you would like to do.

Napoleon sounds like he needs William Buhlmans Sleep programming tape. The tape gets your subconcious to let go. The ways it helps are listed below.
<br>
<br>
1. As your falling asleep it reminds you of what your goals are and how it will go.
<br>
<br>
2. It breaks the chains of negative, self defeating, in the rut thinking that has been programmed by you and your environment.
<br>
<br>
3. It's also a form of hypnosis. As you are falling to sleep you become more susceptable to suggestions.
<br>
<br>
4. A refreshing break from brainwave and meditation.
<br>
<br>
The tape now available in cd form is available at
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.out-of-body.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.out-of-body.com/

<br>

 I think you still have to buy it with the 4 tape set.  Still inexpensive compared to others.

Hey guys, correct me if I am wrong here...
<br>
<br>
I think napoleon stated in the first post (Sorry for my poor English) and with that, I kept thinking as I read (his?) posts thereafter that it wasn't so much negativity as it was practicality and reality on (his?) part?
<br>
<br>
My impression of foreigners in general is that they are not as spoiled in America with an attitude of you can simply DO EVERYTHING you want whenever you fancy. I think some countries are more disciplined and more realistic of the world THEY live in. Heck, to grow up in a socialist or communist country would give you a HELL of a lot different perspective to the possibilities you have in life. I think America is a progressive place to live as far as exploring as many religious and spiritual studies as you want without having to suffer dire social consequences for doing so.
<br>
I believe in China and Russia, the bible and christianity were banned for many years. In India, you could be subject to a caste system if you are of any worth and the rules that govern it. In the Islamic countries, can you question the possibilities of other spiritual paths as well without being an infidel? And don't forget the power that church and religious organizations can have on someone and screw up their thinking because of dogmatic practices. Because of those spiritual dogmatic influences, (and that includes MANY people in the USA, ahem catholics). you would be too fearful to think outside the confines of your church, lest you go to hell. So napoleon might be correct to a degree. Some people WILL never get this stuff, no matter how hard they try, until they address those mental, spiritual or emotional blocks they have already programmed in their mind preventing them from success in this arena.
<br>
<br>
I hope I am not off-base here but at best, if napoleon, (or I for that matter), is to be criticized, please let it because of simply being misinformed. And please correct us both from a place that we are on the same team, we are all seekers of truth.
<br>
<br>
Namaste,

I think it was mainly a knee-jerk reaction to the title of his post more than anything else.  In it, he wasn't just being pessimistic, he was saying that for some [actually, for most] that OBE was
<i>
 impossible
</i>
.  And here's why it's impossible for
<i>
 you.
</i>
Implication?  Just give it up right now.
<br>
There's certainly a place for staying realistic, and I appreciate lots of the discussion that's happened in this thread.  But it started on the wrong foot I think because it was pessimistic to the point of being untrue (as I believe the consensus is that even the "65%" with brainwaves that aren't naturally conducive to trance can still
<i>

It was good to acknowledge that 65% of us will have to try harder and perhaps use different methods to supplement the usual techniques. I am part of that 65% and will be quick to listen to anything which can help to put me into the 35%. It would be nice to get back on topic.

Guys , remember OOB may have a personal quality that cannot be reduced to a brainwave category.
<br>
<br>
ps 1 - . I come from Europe, you may call me Janis
<br>
ps 2 - Yes, maybe the title of my original post should be more refined, but at least it grabbed your attention , he heh, you sweet Americans
<br>

OK guys, here is some solid food for thought.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "Researcher Toman confirmed the work of Loomis, Harvey and Hobart which showed that people with strong alpha frequencies had a poor range of entrainment to stimulation and those with little or no alpha rhythms could be entrained to a wider range of frequencies including the theta."
</b>
<br>
<br>
I told you.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "G. Oster published an excellent article on the effects of binaural beats (BB) in Scientific American (1973). He showed the difference between monaural beats (MB) and binaural beats. He demonstrated that binaural beats produced much smaller results  than that of monaural beats and concluded that binaural beats have almost no brainwave entrainment value but could be beneficial in diagnosing certain neurological disorders such as Parkinson's Disease."
 <br>
</b>
<br>
<br>
The binaural beats are used on tapes from Monroe Institute.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 "In 1995, in Northwestern University was collected the research on brainwave entrainment using photic stimulation. They found that some persons entrained to the stimulus and ....... others didn't."
 <br>

i briefly glanced over all of the replys to this topic.  i don't know anything about brainwaves yet and plan to look some info up and then re read this thread.  i believe i've come up w/ a good response though.  i believe the reason why you'll never project is because there is no such thing.
<br>
<br>
hell of a good site if it was possible though
