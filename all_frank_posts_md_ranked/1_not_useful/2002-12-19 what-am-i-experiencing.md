<section>
My experiences are returning, and I guess they have to do with my pituitary-surgery, since my first obe:s came after my first surgery over three years ago, then stopped, and now recently returned (about three nights ago and last night) after my second surgery that was about one month ago. The experiences are odd however and I'm not sure they are "typical" or "real" obe:es. They usually start with a slight paralysis of the body, but not a very intense one. I usually get a strange feeling  that the experiences are about to occur, it's hard to explain but I feel like I'm getting a bit dizzy or drowsy and relaxed, although I'm still aware of what's happening and not falling asleep. Then the "pulling" begins, I feel like I'm being pushed or pulled away and travelling really fast forward, I sometimes see a tunnel but usually I don't see anything special at all. It's just this feeling of travelling really fast. I also feel an intense pressure or "drilling" in the pituitary area, that's in the third eye area or the sixth chakra. It doesn't really hurt, but it's not a very pleasant feeling either.  Last night I tried to hang on and await to see what happens next, but the pressure and drilling became even more intense and I travelled forward even faster. I got scared because it really felt that my head was about to explode of the pressure and drilling. I also got scared that the pituitary was being damaged or hurt because of the experience.  I got upset and angry and demanded to be brought back to my bed or wake up, which made the pressure and drilling less intense and I slowed down but was still travelling forward. After a while I returned to the bed and "woke up".
<br>
I was sleeping over at my boyfriend's place. My boyfriend sometimes mutters or speaks in his sleep and during this experience I thought I heard him saying: "What's happening? What's going on?" So I don't know if he noticed anything or was being affected by the experience. It's strange because I usually only get these experiences when I'm sleeping alone.
<br>
Well, to my question: What do you think about these experiences? I'm starting to think that they may be some kind of reaction or "memories" of the surgery itself maybe? They used anesthetics during the surgery, maybe it's a reaction to the anesthetic?
<br>
Anyone who has similar experiences or any advice to what I should do? I really would like to explore the astral world and develop my experiences but I get scared and upset easily and I guess that makes it difficult. The pressure and drilling in the pituitary area is the worst part.
<br>
<br>
Love and light,

Well, the type of experience you described (flying around at lightening fast speeds in the dark) is something that has happened to me more times than I can count, and I never had any type of surgery in my life.  This usually happens when I spontaneously project but I have little to no control over the experience, I end up flailing through the air at remarkable speeds, in pitch black most of the time, and sometimes and intense fear comes over me that I'm going to smack into something.
<br>
<br>
However, to err on the side of caution, I wouldn't completely rule out that this is a side effect of your surgery.  Do you have any check ups that you have to go to in the future?  If so, I would just make sure that you've recovered without any problems.
<br>
<br>
If the doc says that you're good, then I probably wouldn't worry too much about it.  After all, this 'feeling' that you felt in your pituitary (sp?) gland seemed to stop when you willed yourself to slow down and return from your experience.....which leads me to believe that you were just feeling intense energy on your 3rd eye chakra.

Hi Jeff,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your answer. I'm glad to hear that someone shares these experiences with me (except that pressure and drilling part).  I also have no or very limited control of these experiences, which first scared and then frustrated me in the beginning. I guess I still feel that way sometimes, but not as much as before. It's the pressure and drilling in the head and third chakra that bothers me the most now. I don't really know what to tell my doctor, I don't want to tell him about the experiences but I guess I can ask some "neutral" questions when I have my check-up and see him the next time. I guess the experiences in some way have to do with my first surgery, maybe it was some kind of "turning point" in my life or maybe there was some kind of activation of the sixth chakra during the surgeries...I don't know.
<br>
Another thing are these "flying dots" I see, about 50% blue colored and 50% red colored  tiny dots in oval shapes, that fly in the air and that I'm able to see almost everywhere. I've seen them for as long as I can remember. I've been told that a pituitary tumour can affect the vision but they've checked my vision many times and haven't found anything strange or unnatural with it. I haven't told my doctor about these flying dots either, but now I wonder if they have anything to do with my pituitary tumour? But I don't really think so, because I remember seeing these dots when I was 4 years old and I got the tumour about ten years later. So that doesn't really make sense.
<br>
<br>
Well thanks again for your answer Jeff!

I am sure that since you had pituitary surgery you have some karma around it - kind of like the chicken and egg issue-probably whatever trauma they did to you on the physical is reinforced/ intensified by cellular memory from past lives.have you tried to move energy through the area such as the NEW stuff or reiki? I have experienced third eye pressure, I could discribe it as intense but probably not really painful.
<br>
Probably seeing the dots is some indication you have some natural ability -you are already open to these energies.
<br>
You have to think that people we sleep with are tuned in to us- once I was using the falling technique and it was really starting to take off and my wife starts to mutter in her sleep -help, I'm falling!

Hi ralphm,
<br>
<br>
Actually I've been thinking lately about trying reiki or even learn it myself. I've been thinking of that for a long time, but now I have the time and money to learn it and I also feel I'm ready for it. The only thing concerning me is that it might be to close to the surgery and that the initiation-process and/or the cleansing process after the initiation could be to overwhelming for especially my sixth chakra (the pituitary). But I feel excited about reiki and also have a good feeling that it might help me - not just with the experiences but in many ways. So I think I'll start with searching for a master that I like and I'll see.
<br>
<br>
This thing with people close to you being affected by your experiences is kind of interesting I think. When I think of it, I remember both my mother (when I was still living with my parents) and my boyfriend telling me things about their dreams that could be connected to my own experiences at night.
<br>
<br>
Well thank you for your advice about reiki!
<br>
<br>
Love and Light,
<br>

Zebrima: There is a chance that it may have something to do with the surgery. But if you had simply posted an experience that mentioned everything but the surgery, I would immediately have said that what you are experiencing are normal projection symptoms of the kind people such as myself have felt countless times.
<br>
<br>
Also, when you say "drilling" do you mean like a buzzing vibration in your head that feels like your brain is literally shaking from side to side? You also mention that the more intense the drilling the faster you went. Now, can you remember the order of things. Did the drilling begin as you began to move, or did the drilling begin while you were already on the move?
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
I would say the pressure and drilling begins shortly after I start travelling forward. That is, I first feel I'm travelling for a short time, maybe 5 seconds, then the pressure and drilling begins. I'm not completely sure however, but that's the way I remember it. And yes, the drilling could be described as some kind of strong buzzing or vibration in the sixth chakra, but it's rather strong and intense. Not painful, but not pleasant at all. The speed of travelling and the drilling seem to be connected because the faster the speed, the stronger and more intense the drilling and pressure.
<br>
I've also noticed that it often feels like air is rushing at the sides of my body during the experiences. This usually occurs at faster speed and in the middle or end of the experience.
<br>
<br>
Love and Light,
<br>
