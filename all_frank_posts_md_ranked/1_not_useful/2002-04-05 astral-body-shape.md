I have asked this question to a variety of people with a lot of chakra experience.  So here goes:
<br>
Is the astral body the same shape as the physical body?  I'm thinking of people with physical deformities, specifically spinal malformations.  Does the path of the chakra energy stay verticle when the spine is crooked?  Let me know what you think!

OK, so here's the real reason I'm asking this question.  Several weeks ago in the middle of the night, I was awakened by a really intense loud vibration originating at the base of my spine.  I immediately thought, "Oh cool, my Kundalini is going to cut loose anytime now."  The vibration intensified, it was one of those real low but intense sounds and I could feel it in every ounce of my being.  It started at my root chakra and began moving up my spine. Well, I have scoliosis and my spine hangs a wicked 45 degree angle about half way up my back.  As soon as the energy got to the point of my spine where it curves, the whole thing stopped.  So, will I be prohibited from ever moving my energy through my spine?  Is our energy body dependent or independent of our physical body shape?  I could use some help here. Does anyone have an opinion about this?

I know what you're saying.  I actually hadn't ever considered the possibility until I had that weird experience.  It's more of a philisophical consideration I guess.

Greetings.
<br>
<br>
I believe that it doesn't matter what shape or size you are or what ailments you may suffer from. I have read about people who are unable to walk, some who are blind or deaf, and others with various infirmities who were surprised to find themselves with no ailments whatsoever in the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Maybe you expected to feel something that's why you did. Here in the physical we suffer physical pain and afflictions. In the Astral I imagine that we would not have any of these because it is our consciousness that is there, not our solid earthly bodies.
<br>
<br>
All good wishes,
<br>
Barbara

I think a little meta-physical imagination could play a big part in overcoming this. It smacks to me that the problem could quite possibly be more mental than physical.
