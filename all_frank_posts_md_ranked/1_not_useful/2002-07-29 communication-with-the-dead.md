I have an experience that I would like to share, and a few questions.  Lately, since it's summer, I've been waking up at around ten Am, then walking to my couch.  I lie down with the intention of staying awake, but I soon fall asleep.  Pretty much whenever I do this, I have an ld, then an OBE, it's great.  So today I was tired in the afternoon(about 3:00) so I decided to take a nap.  Soon my dream became lucid.  Once I realized this I thought "hey, I'll have an Obe."  Then I felt this sadness.  My grandmother recently passed away, and I got really sad that she wouldn't  be coming over for dinner on Sunday's anymore(it was a tradition), no sooner had I thought this then I felt the world began to spin, and I exited my body.  It was really weird, because all I had to do was visualize her face and I began to leave my body.  I thought "wow, she is closer to me then I realize."  So soon I am sitting down in a chair with her, andI look in the background, and I see this cabana type place, and I felt like it was heaven, or whatever you want to call it.  As cleche as it sounds, it was beautiful and I had a strong desire to go there.  So I see my grandmother, and she looks her best, and I know that I have this have this stupid grin on my face.  I ask her(come to think of it, this may have been telepathic) if she has a message for her family.  She says(or thinks), "tell everyone that I love them"  Then boom, it's over.  It was great.  Here are my questions.  How can I differentiate between and obe and an ld?  I had astral sight, and at one point I looked at my hands and they melted into a gold light.  So can I say with confidence that this was an obe and not just a powerful dream.  Oh, and can someone please describe exactly what astral sight is? I'd describe it as seeing through closed eyelids, because I am usually aware of my physical eyes being closed.  Also, when I begin to think about my astal sight, the world becomes more blurry and unclear.  Sorry for the length.

I'm suprised no one else responded to this...very interesting experience indeed!  There are no easy answers to your questions.  It can be difficult for the inexperienced to differentiate between lucid dreaming and OBE, but the melting hands can be a clue that it was indeed an OBE.
<br>

<br>
Astral sight...hmmm, have you read much about it?  I recommend reading everything on the internet you can get your hands on.  The term itself, in my opinion, is loose and general.  Really, you are going to have to find out for yourself through experience!  Good luck!

this has happened with me a few times too when my father and a close friend died, in fact quite a few more times with other people. It seems that we are strongly connected by love or whatever to those who do graduate to the other side.
<br>
<br>
As to your questions, I think a lucid dream and astral sight are much the same, they both feel similar but one is a little closer to consciousnes (astral sight) than the other (lucid dream). Just do it and enjoy it, the more you practice the more you will understand. Thanks for sharing yor story with us.

Whenever I use the term "Astral sight", I am referring to the ability to see without using your physical eyes.  Sometimes, that means you are seeing behind your closed eyelids while you are lying in bed.  Other times, that means what I am seeing as I have my OBE.  In other words, anything that I see while having an OBE (or close to having one) is astral sight (as opposed to physical sight).
<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.

This all being said, has anybody ever had contact with the dead who they DON'T know?  That is, has anybody ever run into a newly dead person who is wandering around the RTZ confused or anything?  Or tried to help any of them figure out what's going on, or communicate with their famillies or anything?  If I ever get OB, I can see myself doing that kind of thing on a fairly regular basis.  Death is a huge thing, and it would be great if we could help people who have just gone through it, both the living and the dead.

I got the gist that that was what the monroe institute's lifeline program was all about.  Anyone around that participated in that and could shed some light?

Grendel: you cannot help but come into contact with "dead" people on the Astral. There's millions and millions of them all over the place.

Yes, some are just wandering around aimlessly, others are on Astral trains in a coma-like state. Others are just lying around sleeping. There's countless numbers in the belief-system areas doing whatever it is they believe in. And there's the countless numbers of people engaged in all manner of activities on the higher planes.
