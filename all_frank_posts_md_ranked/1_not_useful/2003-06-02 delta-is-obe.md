Hey all. [

<br>
<br>
My friend Louis told me that OBE happened in the Delta brain wave state. I wrote to TMI, and MR. Skip Atwater confirmed the same thing. He said that OBE happens in deep Delta states, and that OBE you can go to all focus levels, from F10 onward. And F10 is mind-awake/body-asleep, which is the state we go OBE from, and from there we can go to all the focus levels there and above, including F12, F15, to 22-27/astrals, etc. Interesting, aye? :&gt;

P.S.
<br>
My present book I am working on I'm dedicating to my friend Louis, as I want to master OBE to go meet him, and pull him out of his OBE hibernation (Not literally though. [:O]) Take care.

Thats interesting info and makes sense.  When I was using the delta waves brain sync cd I would wake up and would be startled cus i felt so detached from my body.  Maybe I was detaching from it.. I might try using that one tonight instead of the theta cd.

Hey!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing with me friend.
<br>
<br>
I had a block against such technologies, for it seemed that I was 'cheating'- cheating myself out of mastering it on my steam. After reading your reply (Up at this time doing interrupted sleep) I went back to practice, and as sleepy as body was my racing awareness and thoughts was keeping me up. I had a meeting with my helper and it came through that it is like my computer. I don't even like to
<i>
 imagine
</i>
what it would be like without it- writing my books with paper and ink only. It would be havoc! One mistake and how much would I have to change? What if I wanted to move a paragraph?! [:O] Not to mention the internet. So technology can help, without stealing... whatever... but saves time and stuff.
<br>
<br>
I've orded me some Brainsync stuff- A delta for projection, a Beta for concentration, and a Alpha for 'what the heck!'. Well. Here's to you. Thank you for sharing goingslow. It's amazing what we can do
<b>
 together
</b>

Cheers. I'll let you all know how it goes for me.
<br>
<br>
And I have something else to share on guides that didn't seem to much but as I think about it (and read Cosmic Journeys) I see that it is, or maybe. Your thoughts would be appreciated. I'll write it and come back and edit in the link to here.

<section>
It worked.. using the delta last night! but it wasn't great cus i was low on energy or something... I wasn't able to go anywhere.  Still though, I know which one to use for sleep more now.
<br>
<br>
The reason I actually started using them wasn't to help me with OBE but to help me with sleep.   I could never sleep at night and ended up taking over the counter sleeping pills for the last year.  They finally made me feel fatigue even during the day so someone bought me the delta cd and it worked.  I use the others for variation but they all work for sleep.
<br>
<br>
What has amazed me more than anything is the way my intuition really has kicked in with these.  at first I thought intuition was kinda like a lucky guess.. I was always so wrong.. i'd double check things cus i felt they were wrong and they weren't.
<br>
<br>
Its come on to the point where its a strong physical feeling and its been right each time.  I dont expect it to always be right, but i know the cd's claim to increase this and I know now that they really do.  I was surprised about that more than anything.  Oh and the lucid dreams have increased too.  I dont have a lot of patience.. I know they might be cheating for some things but hey.. Im sleeping now and having LD's 3 times a week.. OBE's more often than before.  I feel theres other things i need to concentrate on anyway with willpower.. (like ego issues) more than OBE's and stuff.

After reading this thread I just tried a delta setting on the Brainwave Generator, with a binaural beat frequency of 1hz. To my surprise I felt subtle shifting in what I think was my astral body almost immediatly. Frustratingly I was interrupted 3 times by people at the door which kind of put me out of the mood. However those are the most positive results I have had from using it off and on over the last 6 months or so. That's the lowest frequency I've used it at too, so I am going to keep using at delta from now, see what happens.

<section>
Id like to try the hemisync cds though but most are pretty expensive.  I got these at the local bookstore
<br>
<br>
Anyway this morning after I posted one of the above posts it was about 4 am my time.  I often wake up for a while before going back to sleep.  I put in the delta CD and went back to sleep.. i suddenly found myself looking up at my room with various things flying at me.  I realized what was happening (it was a weird trance phenomenon) so i tried to roll over on my side.
<br>
<br>
Unlike when I normally roll over on my side my "astral" body was so disconnected from my physical that it rolled over IN my physical which was weird for me.  In other words i was aware of my physical body and my astral so instead of rolling over like i would with my physical it was as if i was going to be facing the back of my head.
<br>
<br>
Anyway I decided to do it a different way and I willed myself to go to the ceiling "i want to touch the ceiling" believe it or not this often works if im out enough.  And i was further out after this but was hearing a lot of noises and voices etc.  So finally i rolled out again and it worked. It was still dark so i couldnt see anything.. but i wasn't able to fly.. and i had a hard time leaving the room.  There was a while of confusion and me trying to get enough clarity to where i finally realized I need to get up and walk out the door.
<br>
<br>
I dont remember much else.. I know i kept trying to fly but couldnt.. and i felt a lot of pressure on my third eye.
<br>
<br>
LIke i said i didnt do much after getting out.  The important thing to me was the CD did help me to disconnect.  In fact it was a stronger disconnect than i usually have.
<br>
<br>
Sorry its so rushed but im in a hurry and have to go.

And to Noxerus. Thank you for sharing, but actually my friend Louis went to a lab, where they hooked him up. He had the mixes of frequencies like you said at first, but THE MOMENT he went OBE ALL of his brainwaves went to Delta. There was nothing else. And MR. Altwater told me the brain wave states for several different states, and all of them were mixed like you say,
<b>
 but

for OBE he said Delta, and he didn't say anything else. And they have people hooked up all the time.

Hi Celestial,
<br>
<br>
Is the Brain Sync cd that you mention from this website:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.brainsync.com/default.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.brainsync.com/default.asp
</a>
<br>
<br>
I'm always looking for a good cd. Which one did you get that has the delta on it?  I've been using the awakened minds one which is nice, but like to experiment, if you know what I mean.
<br>
<br>

]And that is a very good point. The lab people told him it was like he was putting himself into a coma. So little brain activity, and he reports OBEs being more real than physical life.

<br>
P.S.
<br>
Also, when my friend Louis was experiencing dream imagery and lucid dreaming/APing, he was in Theta (wasn't specific whether or not something was mixed here), so that is where some confusion may come in. He found that the two states are different brain states; OBE and lucid dreaming are different. So this may explain some of the confusion.

I also noticed with the delta I get a lot more hypnogogic(sp?) images.. I feel  A LOT more relaxed with the theta cds.  I wonder if all t his is normal.. the Delta cd's aren't as pleasing to me though.. the sounds.  Im debating still whether to spend money on the awakened minds cd's or wait to get the gateway series.

Thanks Celestial,
<br>
<br>
I ordered the
<i>
 Sound Sleep
</i>
cd this morning from BrainSync. It seems as though these companies have the technology to produce the right frequencies. What I have liked about the awakened minds cd (which I've been using lately) is that there is no talking on it. By contrast, when I was doing the hemi-sync waveI cds I would get in the proper state only to jump b/c the voice kicked in. The hemi-sync wave I is a great set, don't get me wrong. It's just, at least in my experience, I couldn't get used to being interrupted by a speaker's voice while in a deep state.

Parmenion -
<br>
<br>
I set it at a constant 1hz from start to finish (an hour), I find no problem in relaxing quickly so I didn't use a descending scale as it were.
<br>
<br>
First time on delta I used  seperate frequencies of around 100 and 101hz repectively. It was about 15 mins before I was disturbed in which time I felt the astral body moving about. After the first interuption I wanted to try it with as low left/right frequencies as possible, I figured down to about 30 would still be easily audible. I was disturbed twice so I never really got the chance to test the effect properly. But that's the range and lower that I will be using at from now.

<section>
You're welcome.
<br>
<br>
Just to update, tried it for the first time properly - no disturbances - this morning. Normally I don't project in the mornings, never have to my knowledge but I found myself with some time so I gave it a go.
<br>
<br>
Set the BWGen to 50 and 51hz. This gives a very audible low frequency wobble. Although I have to say from the start that I didn't project nor did I have any projection symptoms, I did feel very good. I found I was having long periods (10 or 20 secs) of thoughtless silence, the kind of stillness it takes awhile to achieve by conventional meditation. Plus when my focus did slip it did so very lightly and was easy to bring back. Occasional hypnogogic imagery flashed across my mind, and several times I heard conversations as if eavesdropping on a movie. At the time they were very clear and specific and I remembered each one easily. If only I had thought to write them down afterwards I would still remember them, but I didn't as I had to do some work after which I couldn't remember one of them.
<br>
<br>
After about 30 minutes I got cold and decided to stop. That's my best experience yet with any setting on the BWGen. I can't swear it was the software that definitly aided my clear and relaxed state, but I think it probably was. The long periods of quiet focus were very distinct, and this was just within about 10 mins of laying down and putting the headphones on.
<br>
<br>
I'm convinced and interested enough to keep on with it. Normally I project afternoons or early evenings, so maybe I just didn't feel it was the right place and time this morning. If I get time I'll try again later this afternoon when I stop work.

I received the

"Sound Sleep" Delta CD today when I got home from work. Just gave it a little listen and it sounds good. Tonight I'll have a full go at it. I want to compare it to the other CD I've been listening to, that is the Awakened Minds CD, which is a good CD as well. Someone more technical could probably describe the precise differences in the frequencies (if any). For me. one sounds like rainfall (awakened minds) and the other a kind of "celestial" music.

One thing I really wish is that someone would invent headphones you can sleep on your side with.  My ears are killing me from those bud things and I hate having to sleep on my back the whole time.  The way I use these CD's is go to sleep with them.. I usually wake up in an LD or trance state when the cd ends.
<br>
<br>
I cant listen to them for a few days though.. cus of the ear thing.

<section>
I don't think it is that moronic to 'breathe through your ankles' lol, it's just language used to achieve some kind of physical and mental response. I have a hypnosis tape that tells you to imagine your body as a glass container filled with orange liquid, valves open in your fingers and toes and the orange liquid flows out taking the negativity with it. It's not bad, you don't have to visualise strongly, that's over doing it I think, but just let the gist of the idea settle into the brain. If you start with the attitude 'this is just stupid' it probably wont be effective.

I understand what he was getting at, but the way he said it just made me laugh.
<br>
If something sounds silly, then it is just going to destroy the moment.
<br>
I think that the language used is important with keeping people concentrating on the cd. For example if a voice suddenly says "imagine that your feet have turned into 10 foot high blue rubber ducks and floated off into the distance" this would seriously cause me to lose my concentration and probably make me laugh.
<br>
<br>
I did think that the language used on the 10 min tune up from brain sync, seemed perfect though.

I tried the delta setting again this afternoon, it's kind of frustrating because i definitely felt a deep sense of relaxtion, and perceptibly slowed-down mind chatter. Again though I was disturbed, this time by two lawnmowers. I stuck with it, but in the end I decided i was past the point where i was likely to settle into a projection state.
<br>
<br>
It does seem worth persuing at this low frequency (1hz), if nothing else it does seem to produce a meditative state - something that hasn't happened for me on the preset settings.

  One thing I really wish is that someone would invent headphones you can sleep on your side with.  My ears are killing me from those bud things and I hate having to sleep on my back the whole time.  The way I use these CD's is go to sleep with them.. I usually wake up in an LD or trance state when the cd ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  I cant listen to them for a few days though.. cus of the ear thing.

I use the tiny earpieces which fit within the ear. Plus, I use two pillows spaced a little way apart. That way I can lay on my side with my head supported and my ear neatly sits in the gap between the two pillows. Works a treat.

I bought the Brain power brain sync version today at the book store.  This one doesn't just do delta or theta etc.. it does all of them.  Ill write on this thread of anything interesting happens.  One thing I really like about the brain sync cd's is they're so cheap (relatively) I dont mind just trying a new one out.  Well 15 bucks isnt that cheap but you know what I mean.
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
I didnt even think of that!  thanks for the tip frank.  Kinda mad something like that didnt even dawn on me.

<section>
goingslow,
<br>
<br>
Please keep us posted on that
<i>
 Brain Power
</i>
CD from brain sync. Something you mentioned in an earlier post about the delta not being as pleasing struck me because that is what I'm experiencing now. I've been using the "Sound Sleep" cd and it isn't quite right for me. I think I may try the one you bought or else the one they call Deep Meditation.
<br>
<br>
The nice thing about these cd's (as you pointed out) is they are pretty inexpensive, and that allows some experimentation.
<br>
<br>

Today I've ordered the HemiSync "Super Sleep" CD which also has nothing but Delta on it. Has anybody tried it yet? Any success?
<br>
I will keep you updated if I have success with it and even if i don't.

<section>
Nick,
<br>
<br>
I bought the
<i>
 Guided Meditation
</i>
Cd a while back.  At the time I didnt realize I should skip the guided part.  Howerver, I enjoy her voice, the second part is purely sound.  The sound on this CD is my favorite.  I would imagine its the same as deep mediation, maybe just a little different.  I want to get deep mediation soon.. I think I really saw results with all the CD's over a period of time.  Even the Beta one (more images).
<br>
<br>
The Delta CD puts me in a real state of "timelessness" often to the point Im startled to find myself so detached from my body.  But one good thing about it (despite the sound not being so pleasant) is I often wake up feeling REALLY good on this one.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to wait a little before commenting on the
<i>
 Brain Power
</i>
Cd, however the other day I purposely tried to stay awake to pay attention to the details.  I have a hard time staying awake lately on them due to the fact I welcome sleep and have recently started a new job.  After about 15 minutes of listening to the "Brain Power" CD I felt strong vibrations.  I didnt try to project though because I was too aware mentally and that doesn't work for me.
<br>
<br>
It says use for at least six weeks and I've found most of these CD's really have a good effect in my waking life after a period of time.  So when I notice more stuff about this CD i might just post another topic.  Since this one will probably be on page 20 by then.
<br>
<br>
take care.

<section>
goingslow, celestial, and everyone,
<br>
<br>
There is another topic that I've been posting these cd reviews at. It is Frank's awakened mind cd review topic. What I did there was to give my impression of the Awakened Mind cd as well as the Brain Sync cd entitled
<i>
 Sound Sleep
</i>
which consists of Delta frequencies. With respect to the latter cd, I have found that it takes me so very deep to where I am losing the "mind-awake" part of the equation. So I thought I would experiment with a different cd from Brain Sync since the price is only $14.95 (USD).
<br>
<br>
Today I received the Brain Sync cd called
<i>
 Deep Meditation
</i>
. The insert to that cd reads in part: "
<i>
 Deep Meditation
</i>
delivers a unique combination of brain wave frequencies to produce an extraordinary mind-awke/body-asleep state. The music delivers a gradual progression of tones that resonate with the seven energy centers in the body..." So I'll try this one for a while and see if it helps as a sort of primer to my astral sessions. I'll report back with my impressions after a while.
<br>
<br>
Very best,

There is Beta Brain Waves, Alpha Brian Wave, Theta Brain Waves and the last is Delta Brain Waves.
<br>
<br>
Theta is the level in which you go into AP (Theta) is call Lucide Dreaming State-Hypnosis.  In Theta both Conscious and Sub Conscious are at the level were they are both equal in depth.  There are several levels of Theta.  Light, Medium, Deep(which is Somnambulism or Lucid Dreaming).  When you go beyond that point its Deep Somnambulism, then Esdiale State, Canatonic State, and the last one is Ultra Depth (Sichort State)in which Edgar Cayce go into.
<br>
<br>
Then when you go deeper you enter Delta Brain Wave.  Which is the state that you dream.  Your Conscious mind is shut down at that level thats why you can't remember your dreams.
<br>
<br>
Thats why your Conscious and Sub Conscious has to be balance equally which can only happen in the Theta Brain Wave.
<br>
<br>
Thats why this forum is here so you can get more information so you won't be mislead by wrong information.
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.

For everyone who wants to try this.
<br>
<br>
Deep relaxation with HYPNOSIS. Just read it aloud softly in a monotone voice using a tape recorder or have someone else read it to you. When you see this in the sentences (...) pause for 4 seconds that gives the subconsious time to take it in. Then continue to read the script.
<br>
<br>
It'll will take you about 45 minutes to reach Somnambulism (Lucid Dreaming) after that first cession you will have a post hypnotic word given to you "Deeply Relax" which is in the script and when you say it to yourself "Deeply Relax"  in your mind it will bring you back into that same deep relaxe'd state that you were in before instantly.
<br>
<br>
So below this line is the script.
<br>
______________________________________________________________________
<br>
<br>
PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION
<br>
(sitting)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Speak slowly and pause between instruction.  Have your subject sit comfortably in his chair with both feet on the floor, arms loosely on the lap...no chewing gum or hard candy in the mouth.  When you have him close his eyes, tell him he will keep them closed until you ask him to open them.  Please do not say  "SLEEP" during the progressive.  When bringing the subject up, do not say "I WILL AWAKEN YOU." (This is a camouflage method of hypnosis).  When you explain relaxation, avoid the work HYPNOSIS.  The wording is as follows: (Pause) for 4 seconds.
<br>
<br>
"Close your eyes and keep them closed until again I ask you to open
<br>
them. (Pause) Now I would like you to take a deep breath and let it out
<br>
<br>
slowly. (Pause) Now  take a second, deep and comfortable breath and
<br>
let that out too, very slowly. (Pause) Now I would like you to take a
<br>
third deep and very comfortable breath, filling your lower and upper
<br>
lungs and hold it. (Pause) Now let that out, very, very slowly and
<br>
already you can feel your body starting to RELAX. (Pause) Now let
<br>
that wonderful, comfortable feeling of relaxation flow all the way
<br>
down to your feet." (Pause)
<br>
<br>
<br>
"FEEL your feet becoming very comfortable and very RELAXED, (Pause)
<br>
if you don't feel that right away in your feet don't worry about it, for it
<br>
will catch up to you.  (Pause) Now let that wonderful feeling of relaxation
<br>
flow up into your ankles, (Pause) from your ankles up all the large and
<br>
small muscles of your legs, to your knees, (Pause) from your knees up all
<br>
the large and small muscles of your thighs, (Pause) into your hips, (Pause)
<br>
from your hips into your abdomen, and with each and every breath
<br>
you exhale, you can feel your body RELAX much more." (Pause)
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Now let that relaxation flow up all the large and small muscles of your
<br>
neck. (Pause) Just feel all those large and small muscles of your neck
<br>
RELAX, (Pause) flowing right up into your head, (Pause) over your
<br>
head, (Pause) and DOWN into your brow; (Pause) all the muscles around       your eyes, relax, (Pause) all the muscles of your eyes relax, (Pause) all the
<br>
muscles of your chin, relax. (Pause) Now, if your teeth are clenched, just
<br>
unclench your teeth and your body will relax much more." (Pause)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, as I count from one DOWN to three, with each count your body
<br>
will go DEEPER, (Pause) and DEEPER into this wonderful RELAXED
<br>
state.  So, One...DEEPER and DEEPER, (Pause) Two...DEEPER and
<br>
DEEPER RELAXED. (Pause) Three...very deep, very comfortable and
<br>
Relaxed. (Pause) Now, any sounds that you may hear will just guide you
<br>
deeper.  Following my suggestions will also guide you DEEPER and the
<br>
sound of my voice will guide you EVEN DEEPER into this wonderful
<br>
state.
<br>
<br>
Now again I will count, but this time from One down to Five and this
<br>
time you will let the muscles in your body double the relaxation they
<br>
now have. (Pause) One...your relaxation is starting to double. (Pause)
<br>
two...relaxation is doubling more and more. (Pause) Three...very
<br>
comfortable and very relaxed. (Pause) Four...your relaxation has
<br>
almost doubled. (Pause) Five...relaxation now has doubled throughout
<br>
your whole body. (Pause) From the top of your head to the tips of your
<br>
toes all the muscles in your body have relaxed and doubled their
<br>
relaxation, (Pause) with just pleasant contented thoughts going
<br>
throughout your whole body.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now again I will count from One down to Five, and this time you will let
<br>
the muscles in your body TRIPLE their relaxation.  So, One...your
<br>
relaxation is starting to triple. (Pause) Two...your relaxation is tripling
<br>
more and more. (Pause) Three...very comfortable and very relaxed.
<br>
(Pause) Four...your relaxation has almost tripled. (Pause) Five...
<br>
relaxation has now tripled throughout your entire body, (Pause) from
<br>
the top of your head to the tips of your toes, all the muscles in your
<br>
body have relaxed, doubled their relaxation, and tripled their relaxation.
<br>
(Pause)
<br>
<br>
Your whole body feels so good, so comfortable and so relaxed. (Pause)
<br>
all your muscles are completely loose and limp. (Pause) All your body
<br>
organs are functioning perfectly. (Pause)  All your glands are
<br>
functioning perfectly. (Pause) All your body tissues are rejuvenating in
<br>
this wonderful, comfortable, relaxed state. (Pause)
<br>
<br>
You will find that your arms and your legs are very heavy, very
<br>
comfortable, very relaxed.  They are so heavy, so comfortable, so
<br>
relaxed, that if I should ask you to lift a leg or an arm, you would
<br>
find that they  are so heavy, so relaxed, that you would not feel
<br>
like lifting a leg or an arm.  They feel so much better just resting
<br>
right where they are. (Pause) But nevertheless, I would like you
<br>
<br>
<br>
to try to lift your right leg. (Short pause)
<br>
<br>
Alright, stop trying and let it relax.  It feels so much better to let it
<br>
relax right where it is. (Pause)
<br>
<br>
Now you find that your left leg is just as comfortable, just as
<br>
relaxed, and when I ask you to lift it, you will not feel  like
<br>
lifting it because it feels som comfortable just where it is." (Pause)
<br>
I would like you to try to lift your left leg. (Short pause)
<br>
<br>
Alright, stop trying and let it relax.  It feels so much better to let
<br>
it relax right where it is. (Pause)
<br>
<br>
Now you find that your arms are just as heavy, just as comfortable,
<br>
just as relaxed as your legs.  When I ask you to lift an arm, you
<br>
won't feel like lifting an arm because it feels so good right where it
<br>
is.  Now, I'd like you to try to lift your right arm. (Short pause)
<br>
<br>
Alright, stop trying, let yur arms relax.  You find that your right arm
<br>
was so heavy, so relaxed, that you did not feel like lifting it. (Pause)
<br>
<br>
You find that your left arm is just as heavy, just as comfortable, just as
<br>
relaxed.  You don't feel like lifting it, but nevertheless, I just want you
<br>
to try. (Short pause)
<br>
<br>
O.K. stop trying, just let your body relax, and you will find that your
<br>
body is so comfortable and so relaxed, that you feel so good, so
<br>
wonderful, (Pause) so comfortable, that you just didn't feel like lifting
<br>
any parts of your body.
<br>
<br>
(LONG Pause)
<br>
<br>
Now I will have you open your eyes on the count of one. (Pause) You
<br>
will be refreshed, rejuvenated, and relaxed, feeling wonderful and fine
<br>
in every way. (Pause) So. Three...gradually, slowly start coming up,
<br>
Two...coming up more and more. ..One...eyes open, all the way up,
<br>
feeling wonderful and fine in every way.

Thanks Nick
<br>
<br>
Glad to have found this site.  When I read the Delta information I had to let everyone know that Delta is pro found sleep that where everyone dreams.
<br>
<br>
Think of the mind as a large deep pool of water like a pond Delta is the lower level of the water in the pond.  Theta is the middle level of water, Alph is 3/4 closer to the surface and above 3/4 to the top is Beta Consciouness.
<br>
<br>
So think of your self as a deep sea diver and when your at the bottom your dreaming and then slowly you go up and you start to go into the middle level of the water of the pond Concsiousness starts to enter.  When your in the middle of that water level both Concscious and Sub Conscious are equal and u have the feeling of two minds at the same time.
<br>
<br>
Pleas forgive me if you think I'm stepping on anyones toes but when your hear to learn everyone has to have an open mind to all information you  u can use it for your best goals in life.
<br>
<br>
I've learn some information here also and I thought I was doing some things right but I wasn't.
<br>

<section>
hypnotist,
<br>
<br>
You dont need to apologize for stating what you know about delta vs theta.  I think there's some truth to what you say.  I have had OBE's using the theta CD too.  I think its important to know which will help you get there if you're "phasing" into the astral.  The way I use them are sort of different.  I just put the headphones on (theta, Delta, or even Beta) then lay back and allow myself to go to sleep.  When I use any brain sync type CDs I wake up in trance.
<br>
<br>
Ive had spontaneous OBE's without the CD's but they're less predictable.  But if a person is going to phase to the astral I think delta will probably put them too deep like you said.
<br>
<br>
Im looking forward to try to phase someday, but I haven't really tried using CD's for that purpose.  Maybe if I get the gateway series someday Ill try that.  Though Im afraid the voice will distract me like it did for Nick.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info though.

Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>
How Brain Waves Are CLASSIFIED
<br>
<br>
Beta Wave: the beta state is one of physical atlertness with and emotions responsive to the senses.  Most of our waking time is spent in this state, which is associataed with tensiou and striving.  While in beta, one experiences a sense of control of time and space.
<br>
<br>
Alpha Wave: This is the area of mind which brings increase creativity and physical relaxtion.  Not only is the level of stress reduced but many people enter a light or hypnoidal trance calle meditation.  At this level, there is a slowing down of brain and body pulsation.
<br>
<br>
Theta Wave: Theta is the portal for entering nightime sleep.  We all pass through theta twice a day:  when we fall asleep and when we awakin in the morning.  With hypnosis, we maintain theta for as long as the session lasts.  At this level, behavior can be modified.
<br>
<br>
Delta Wave:  Delta is profound sleep.  There is a further slowing down of mental vibrations.  While in delta, we dream and sort out our mental and physical machinery.  This is a period of regeneration and cell renewal, and, without sufficient delta sleep, one can suffer from sleep depriviation.
<br>
<br>
In Delta State the Conscious mind is inactive no sugguestion can be recieved by the conscious mind. Time and space (enviornment around you does not exist).
<br>
<br>
HOW DOES HYPNOSIS FEEL?
<br>
<br>
To begin with hypnosis is not sleep.  When we are asleep, we are largely unconscious, with our conscious minds inactive.  During sleep, the subconscious mind as well as the conscious mind is inaccessible to the "input" of suggestion.  Hypnosis, rather, feels like suspended animation.  The body sleeps while the mind is totally aware and receptive to ideas.  There is a profound feeling of relaxation through every nerve and muscle of the body.  This physical contentment is combined with a feeling lf blissfulness.
<br>
<br>
So when your using the CD'S to enter Delta your really entering Theta. While in Delta your inaccessible to information on tape or CD'S only when your in Theta are you accessible to suggestions on tape and CD'S
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps clear some things up.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Frank (hypnotist)

Sorry if somebody already said this, but I didn't want to read all the posts to find out if somebody did.  I saw something on TV once about OBE's and some lab was conducting tests on people who had OBE's frequently and they said that they found that each time a person had an OBE they were in alpha.

I too use the Awakened Minds cd off and on. While it is the only one I've used so far, I find it works well on myself and all of my friends who have tried it. Even one uninterested in meditation and OBE found it useful for relaxation - indeed, she was oblivious to her surroundings for the whole track in the middle of Rittenhouse Square, with all the hustle and bustle of Philadelphia going on around her - though she was a little bewildered by her experience and rarely uses it now.
<br>
<br>
I haven't used any other products, though I would happily take suggestions. However, I find the steady rain used on the Awakened Minds cd very effective, and I think I would prefer it to any sort of music. Who has known any piece of music to be enjoyed by one and all? In contrast, I don't think anyone, especially in the state of relaxation or what-have-you that these cds are meant to induce, objects to the gentle patter of raindrops.
<br>
<br>
My humble uninformed opinion,
<br>
<br>
Mark

The one I was talking about was
<i>
 Guided Meditation
</i>
<br>
<br>
However, this particular CD has Kelly Howell talking for the first half which is annoying to a lot of people.  I recommend trying one of the other meditation CD's if that would annoy you.  I think Nick has the
<i>
 Deep Meditation Cd
</i>
this one should also help with intuition etc.
<br>
<br>
The website for the cd is
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.brainsync.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.brainsync.com
</a>
they are relatively cheap and you should use them everyday for a while to see any results.  Ive had really positive results so I recommend them.. I think any brain sync cd's are good but at least with the low price on these you arent taking too much of a risk.
<br>
<br>
the awakened minds cd is something different and im not sure about the website.  Nick would know though I think.
<br>
<br>
good luck

<br>
<br>
I'd just add that with respect to the binaural cd's I've used, that lately I've been sticking with the
<i>
 Deep Meditation
</i>
cd from Brain Sync.
<br>
<br>
As I've posted earlier, the
<i>
 Sound Sleep
</i>
cd put me too deep. Again, everyone's different, but for me I lost the mind awake part of the equation w/ that cd.
<br>
<br>
As to the Awakened Minds cd, it is excellent, just not for me. Where Fyrenze finds the steady rainfall effective, for me it was a bit annoying. I guess it comes down to personal preference because they all seem to work in the same ballpark.
<br>

Cool I have Deep Meditation
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
only listened to it once tho.
<br>
<br>
For it to have any effect is it nessecery to fall into the meditative state? or just listen to it? I can't get into the state cos my mouth always waters and i have to swallow
<img alt=":(" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/sad.png" title="Sad"/>
so my neck upwards is never relaxed enough.

<section>
Faceless,
<br>
<br>
What we're shooting for is a nice transition to the mind-awake/body-asleep state or Focus 10 as Robert Monroe called it. The binaural cd is an assist, but not absolutely necessary, to get to that state.
<br>
<br>
That state of mind-awake/body-asleep is where we need to be before we can go into other focus levels (astral phasing) or obe. So when you say meditative state, I'm not sure what you mean because I am looking to go to that state I described.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the physical issue of saliva buildup, whenever that has happened to me I tried a different position and it usually resolves itself.
<br>

So OBEs are closer to ordinary dreams than to lucid dreams? I think there's something wrong with that statement since they say consciousness of ego can only act till the brain reaches theta waves and not beyond that, delta.
<br>
<br>
It means that when you're lucid dreaming you're actually having a lighter sleep than when you're having unconscious dreams?
<br>
<br>
I guess it would make sense to say that all dreams happen at delta mainly and when you're lucid theta is also playing a big role in the mix of frequencies, and as theta starts fading you begin losing consciousness. That could explain why it can be hard to maintain lucidity for a long period, you either awake or gradually lose it. It would also make sense to say that not everyone experience a 'pure delta state' in wich no other waves can be detected, and somehow there can be a consciousness at that state (OBE).
<br>
<br>
It suggests consciousness doesn't depend on brainwaves, or, if it does, it would be on delta (since without delta there could be no theta, alpha or beta), and if so then comes the question: why does consciousness fade at all?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, please, I'm trying to sort it out to understand it better.

The Subconscious or Delta State is a protective state.  Your Subconscious mind accesses billions of information for the Conscious mind.
<br>
<br>
If the Conscious part of the mind had more input from the Subconscious that overflow of information would put the Conscious into shock.
<br>
<br>
Think of both the Conscious and Subconscious as a football in an upright position.
<br>
<br>
The top is the Conscious part of the mind awake and at the bottom is the subconscious during the waking part of the day.
<br>
<br>
Now as you go to sleep imagine the football tilting slowly towards the right, and as the Conscious part of the football goes down the Subconscious goes up.
<br>
<br>
When the Conscious part of the football reaches the Middle on the opposite side is the Subconscious at that point one is in Lucid State or (Hypnosis).
<br>
<br>
As the Conscious part of the football still goes down and reaches the bottom the Subconscious is at the top which is Profound Sleep or (Delta State).
<br>
<br>
At this level the Conscious mind is inactive to any suggestions or awareness of any external stimulus.
<br>
<br>
You have to remember that both Conscious and Subconscious is like Ying and Yang.  Once can work with out the other.
<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Frank Mulley A. Ht.

Hello hypnotist, thank you for the input. I understand it now. I was thinking dreams happened during Delta, but I see they happen during the REM phase, when the brainwaves are similar to the waking state, therefore it is also called paradoxical sleep.
<br>
<br>
Our sleep is divided into 2 phases: synchronized sleep or non-REM and desyncrhonized sleep or REM. These phases are consecutive, and together they form the sleep cycle.
<br>
<br>
When we lay down to sleep we first go through the non-REM phase, our brainwaves slow down from beta to alfa, then theta and delta. After this the brainwaves speed up a bit and then comes the REM phase, when we dream. "REM sleep is a sleep in which EEG waves resemble those occurring when we are awake. But the muscles weaken as if being paralyzed, except the muscles that cause the eye movement. Therefore, some people define this kind of sleep as 'a state in which an active brain functions in a paralyzed body'."
<br>
<br>
This cycle repeats itself 4 to 5 times along the night. "The whole process will recur interchangebly, with shorter NREM sleep and longer REM sleep until he wakes up."
<br>

What were the brain wave states for the several different states that Mr. Atwater told you?   Did he tell you what brain wave frequencies related to the different Focus States, i.e., Focus 10,12,15,21, etc?
<br>
<br>
Look forward to hearing from you.

He had the mixes of frequencies like you said at first, but THE MOMENT he went OBE ALL of his brainwaves went to Delta. There was nothing else. And MR.

Hi hanner1,
<br>
<br>
sweet_celestial_sounds has not visited the forum since last December. Hopefully he'll return and answer your question. This thread was started last year as you can see from the post dates. We had a number of related threads before and since on delta, focus levels and various related frequencies.
<br>
<br>
The best I can offer is to try the search engine and keep substituting different keywords until you find what you're looking for. Also, be sure to look into related information stored in our File Library. Just go to the top of the page and click the appropriate link.[

As my interest was peaked by the reference to Skip Atwater, I located a few links that may resolve what you are inquiring about.
<br>
<br>
His name is F.Holmes "Skip" Atwater, and the below links should help:

Hey

...
<br>
<br>
I did a search for the email correspondences between Skip and I and was unsuccessful. I'll try again...
<br>
<br>
I don't remember all that was said, but he
<i>
 did
</i>
give me brain wave states for each focus state from F1 through F21 at least. He directed me to the articles on the TMI site:
<br>
<br>
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.monroeinstitute.org/research/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.monroeinstitute.org/research/
</a>
<br>
<br>
Here, if you sift through them all, you should find what he told me. I didn't do anything special though; I just emailed him. Perhaps you should try (and share everything with us... Mwahaahaaa!!!) Email him in the name of the boards!
<br>
<br>
I'll still look for the email. My search conked out.
<br>
<br>
...
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say in my reentry into practice I've been using the Delta Brain Sync CD almost every night. Now when I use it, some vibrations start in the center of my head and radiate out into my body. Here is that experience...

Hey
<i>
 all
</i>
...
<br>
<br>
My latest experiences with the delta frequencies from Brain Sync...
<br>
<br>
Lately I've been meditating with them before practice very regularly. Now I am started to get vibrations that start in my head, and eventually radiate out form there into my entire body. This is of course very unusual for me, and I must as such link them to the use of this CD. They start right in the center of my head (pineal gland?) and radiate outward. One time it was like ripples on water, radiating out, like throwing a rock in water. But they radiated out as a continuously reopening sphere, over and over again, with several 'sphere's' of radiations being present at any given moment in time. They used to be the mock-vibes of alpha, but now they are the real vibes of theta, so it's progressing. And then I'm adding my affirmations (See Cezyl's OBE and Astral Corner). I'll master this thing...
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll keep you posted...
