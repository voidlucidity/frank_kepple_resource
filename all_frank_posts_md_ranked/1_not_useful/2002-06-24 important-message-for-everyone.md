Im not only writing this because I myself want too.But I promised the angels I would help people.I didnt mention that in my other post,I taught maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me.But I ended up having a small talk with them,when  first saw them.And they asked me the question.I taught about it for awhile.Because I always think before I promise somebody something.And I told them that they should know me by now.Ive only broken a few promises in my life.And that was a very long time ago.When I felt as if I was my own worst enemy.I told them yes I promise and I will try my best to

<br>
heres some poems from the book:
<br>
<br>
RETURN TO LIFE
<br>
I waken
<br>
And nothing is the same,
<br>
for the first time,
<br>
I open my eyes,
<br>
These eyes of mine
<br>
I long believed could see
<br>
And find out that all I knew as true
<br>
Was nothing but a false dream
<br>
<br>
Then,like a radient star
<br>
The Angel of Death
<br>
The Angel of Life became
<br>
And transformed my dream
<br>
From a drama of fear
<br>
To a joyful comedy.
<br>
<br>
So surprised,I ask the Angel
<br>
"Am I dead?"
<br>
She replies,
<br>
Yes for these many years,
<br>
Though your heart beat on,
<br>
Your mind slept in a grave of illusion
<br>
Unconscious of your divinity.
<br>
<br>
Now,with heart beating.
<br>
And body breathing,
<br>
Your mind has wakened from hell.
<br>
Renewed,your eyes
<br>
Admire the beauty awaiting you
<br>
<br>
"Your divine awareness wakens
<br>
All the love in your being
<br>
Hating and fearing forsaken,
<br>
Gone are the guilt and the blame.
<br>
Your soul forgives,
<br>
Your divinity lives".
<br>
<br>
My eyes,in fascination,stare at the Angel.
<br>
Sensing the truth waking in me.I surrender,willingly,
<br>
Without condition
<br>
Humbly receiving
<br>
Death and life
<br>
to hell,I release all claim
<br>
And with new eyes,
<br>
See my eternal love...leaving

<section>
The subnavel storage area is just under the belly button. The tan tien is, too, from taoist yoga. Then from the Japanese culture there is the hara. Then there are the seven main chakras and the 3rd is the power chakra. I knew that this energy center was involved in self-confidence, the ability to trust, digestion, and will-power. What I just learned was that when you focus on this energy center and stabilize your attention there it is possible to limit the effects of the energies in your environment on your energy system. It makes for a better response than dulling yourself to your surroundings, but accomplishes the same effect. I plan to use this to avoid getting caught up in the negativity of a couple of people around whom I have trouble staying positive. People who are shut down energetically are in some ways safer than people just beginning to open up and become sensitive to energy.The initial stages are the most dangerous. The usual defenses aren't working and the new ones aren't in place. That is why I was so happy to see the application confirmed.

I'm so glad you found a ray of light.  Sleep well.

Tom,
<br>
<br>
This is very interesting.  I think this would be very helpful to me (and Alpha).  Where exactly is the 3rd chakra located?  And what do I have to do with it?  I dont understand "stabilize your attention there" - just keep your awareness there?

Greetings Alpha...
<br>
<br>
I'm fairly new to this community of like minded people. But as you stated earlier this place is certainly special. Everybody tends to want to help each other. If all of humanity behaved in a manner like this...well...it would certainly be great.
<br>
<br>
Your post  has inspired me and was easy to understand. Reading it gave me food for thought and i thank you for that! As i visite this domain I find myself drawn like a magnet. People like you and so many others here give me that little extra boost of confidence.

Some descriptions place the third chakra a couple of fingerwidths below the belly button. Some a couple above. One of my teachers said it is up even higher, at the bottom of the ribs.

<br>
Page 49: "Directing your attention to your HARA connects your second chakra with your third chakra so that the incoming energies are sent directly on to the 'main transformer' -- the solar plexus chakra -- to be transformed and stored for later purposeful use. The more energies that flow in you now, the better. They will all be integrated into your energy system and thereby strengthen you. So directing your attention to the HARA is a something that's really great. In order to truly make use of the incoming vibrations in this harmonious way, you will need some practice. At the beginning you will most likely actually integrate about 3 - 5% of the energy flowing to you. But even this amount, which may appear to be quite minor to you, will very much relieve your energy system and provide it with a great deal of fresh energy under certain circumstances. Practice with your HARA on a regular basis and check your progress time and again."
<br>
<br>
There are several exercises in the book that look helpful for dealing with energy patterns, both internal and external.

thanx for the bit of info tom,Ive been trying it out.But havnt got the chance to test it yet.
<br>
Ive been feeling quite drained after this incident.I read somewhere about this too.This so called head doctor was giving some kind of evil eye.He just wouldnt take those eyes off me at all.I dont remember where I read it.But its like you can send a horde of these creatures to your enemies.I know he was just doing his job.But this has made me very angry.And Ive actually not been able to recall anything in the morning.But im alright now.And I dont hold it against him.He may know alot about pychology and other related things.But does he really know anything at all?If he knew what he was really doing,he wouldnt of done that.I may never go to another pychiatrist again.Good thing there is something called karma.If he could actually see these creatures.He would wet his pants.And they would leave me and attack him.lolFor im not afraid of them.

<br>
<br>
The Judge and the Victim
<br>
There are two main rulers in helll-the Judge and the
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///victim.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 Victim.In
</a>
our mind,our Judge blames us.Our Victim recieves the blame and feels guilty.These  two aspects of ourselves hate each other.Communication between them in each of us was broken during the process of our domestication,no matter which beliefs were held by the elders who raised us.
<br>
Humans are domesticated animals.Before we were born,the dream of the planet already existed,with all of its rules,beliefs and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///hopes.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 hopes.In
</a>
the dream they are there waiting for the new humans to grow up and develop their minds in order to continue to control  the dream.A pure,normal human being would be one who is still free,as he or she was in childhood before domestication,at the approximate age of one and a half to three years of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///age.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 age.At
</a>
that age,the child developed enough mind to understand the abstract and to control language enough to communicate with other humans.However,the proces of education has not yet taken place.The little human follows the normal tendency to play,to explore,to laugh and to enjoy life.Almost all the childs emotions are coming from love unless he is angry or in pain.This little human is free to be and he lives his life in the present.He does not worry about the past.He is not worried about the future.The adults live constantly  in the past and they are so worried in their effort to build their future that they avoid living in the present.For the adult,all the dramas of life are serious,but for the child nothing is really important.
<br>
The dream waits to teach the small child how to join the old dream of the planet.Our parents,older brothers and sisters,our teachers,the school,religion,society and the media all contribute to keeping the dream of the planet alive through domestication.They introduced  us to the concepts  of good and bad,by rewarding the good and punishing the bad.
<br>
Usually,when we feel the punishment we have a sense of injustice and we rebel.That opens a wound in our mind and the result of that wound is to create emotional poison.We feel that pain in our heart as an emotional,not a physical,pain.From this wound,the emotional poison gets in our mind.Fear begins to start controlling our behavior and our mind.We become afraid of receiving punishment and we also fear not receiving a reward.The reward comes as a sign of acceptance.We struggle to be worthy of it in the eyes of our parents,our teachers and friends,and society itself.Many times during the day as we grow up,we are subject to the judgement of others and to the polarities that our society supports,such as right and wrong,beautiful and ugly.Soon,we begin making our own judgements.
<br>
Domestication becomes so strong that we no longer need anyone to domesticate  us because we take over the task of  our domestication by punishing ourselves and occasionally by rewarding ourselves.Three components in our mind are actively engaged in our self domestication.The Judge is that part of the mind that judges what we do,and what we do not do,what we feel,what we do not feel,what we think,what we do not think,and it also judges everything and everyone.The victim receives the judgement and usually the Judge finds the victim guilty.The Victim receives the judgement and usually the judge finds the victim guilty.The victim has a need to be punished.The victim part of the mind feels unworhty and repeats over and over again,"I am not good enough,nor intelligent enough,nor strong,nor beautiful enough.I am a loser.Why should I try?"
<br>
(Note from alph:I actually think I ran into this victim in an obe in the mental planes.He had no face and wore a dark outfit covering his whole body.He wasnt happy and told me to go away.I have a theory why people say you could go insane from astral projecting.They might feel threathened and destroy this thing in there mind.And i think it would lead to something like
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///that.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
be very careful.I dont fight anything at all on the astral.Except once or twice I got the wrong idea.But I learned.This is my
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///choice.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 choice.You
</a>
make your own.)The third part of the mind involved in the judgement process is the belief system we have been taught which includes all the rules on  how to dream our life.The belief system is a kind of constitution or holy book where everything that we believe without discussion is our truth.I call this belief system the book of hell.
<br>
The inner Judge bases all judgements in the belief system.Once we reconize this,we see there is no justice in our own mind.If there were justice, we would pay for each of our mistakes once,but our judge makes us pay a thousand times.We pay when we make a mistake and when we remember the mistake,or anyone who reminds us of the the mistake.(alph:sound familiar?,sad but true)Each time,there is the judge finding our victim guilty and punishing us again.
<br>
Our belief system comes to us from society during the period of domestication.We asorb it from our family,the school and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///religion.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 religion.At
</a>
no time does the small child have a choice of what to believe.Throughout the domestication process,the small child rebels,But he lacks the power to change anything.We rebel also as teenagers when we are searching for our
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///identity.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 identity.At
</a>
this crucial time in our lives ,we see how the belief system represses our normal human instincts and how adults manipulate young people.Depending upon how much resistence we meet during our teenage rebellion will be our future self asteem.(alph encounterd much to much resistence..No self asteem left after this point in life.But now it grows stronger everyday
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
)We might find some support and become a success in life,or might succomb to fear.
<br>
The Judge,the Victim and the belief system or book of hell are together a parasite in our mind.The parasite is a living being made from ethereal
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///energy.to" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

survive the parasite feeds on emotions that are created by the human brain.(alph:sounds like the ultimate neg)These  are emotions that come from fear,anger,sadness,depression,jelousy and victimhood.The parasite controls your

</a>
the same time,the brain stops producing the emotions it needs for the growth of the soul,which are the emotions that come from love.

The parasite functions in a similar way to a virus which attacks a cell.The virus controls the reproduction of the cell so that it cannot produce the properties it needs for the cells own growth.Instead it produces what the virus needs for its own growth.The virus lives at the expense of the cell,and it damages the cell little by little untill it is destroyed.We see all around us that human beings are engaged in self-destructive behavior.This is the outward sign of the self destructive mind controlled by the Parasite.
<br>
The toltecs were aware of the parasites existence and they knew that humans have only two

regard to this invasive
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///force.one" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 force.One
</a>
choice is to surrender to the Parasite.(alph:neg people),But the other choice is similar to that made by the little child and the teenager-rebel,declare war against the parasite and declare freedom to be oneself,to have ones' own dream,to use ones' own mind,to create the emotions that feed the real person we are.The Toltecs ofcourse chose to rebel.That is why they are callled warriors.This is the real meaning of the word warrior.
<br>
A warrior is that human who has the awareness of the parasite in his or her own mind and declares war on the parasite for the purpose of self healing.The importance of the war is not to win or to lose,but to try.(alph:if you didnt know this now you know,So its time to go to war with your parasite)
<br>
Every value system has its own book of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///hell.one" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 hell.One
</a>
book or the other is passed on in any family.The judge the victim are present in us regardless of the rightness or wrongness of the belief system we have absorbed..The warriors task is to rebel against our inner judge and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///victim.by" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 victim.By
</a>
following the avenue of the dead at Teotihaucan in the toltec way,the warrior can get beyond the judge and the victim.(alph:if you get high enough on the astral,I believe you can do this but first you must declare war)
<br>
In every contemporary culture,there is an enphasis on suffering.A belief in suffering begets suffering.The Christian heritage teaches that it is necessary to suffer in order to copy Jesus.Miguel says this is a false dream or an illusion.Jesus himself preached  that love was the answer to life.(alph:found out for himself  love was the key to the universe.I noticed the times i was most happiest was when I didnt hate anything at all.This combined with astral projection.I believe you can go anywhere and do anything.Just my opinion)Placing a high value on suffering is just one example of beliefs that permeate our minds and our collective
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///dream.in" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

such phrases as"no pain,no gain"we reveal how deeply we have accepted the idea that we have no right to the joys of painlessness.

ah something i forgot to mention,You might think"alph what the hell does this have to do with obes'"Well I think it has alot to do with it.Especially those who feel they are having them and cant control it.Well I think its because you really are not in control.The parasite is in control.Your not dreaming your own dream.When I found out all these things.I felt like pulling every body out of the dream of the planet.I had a lucid dream this day.I awaken in a house and there are people from my past and present all around.There are 2 skateboards on the side of me upside down.I was laying on my stomach scribbling away on something.I was chit chatting with a few people.And than I went and picked up one of the skateboards.And I was looking at it.Someone asked me what was wrong.I said I believe I am dreaming.And I tried to fly and I did.Everybody started cheering and clapping.And we started to make like a flying train.This was funny but than my mother said"whats that"I hear a noise coming from outside.And I got spooked and ended up back in my body.Well I sat and taught about what this
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///meant.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 meant.It
</a>
became very clear to me.I cant start pulling people out like I want too.Some people are just not ready for this kind of freedom.And the skateboards were there to remind me that life is about Love,friends and fun,and I feel it was for  me not to worry about the choices other people make.There was a time in my life when all I did was skateboard all day everyday.There isnt really anything better than that.Constant fun!Yah I may of got hurt pretty badly sometimes but it never stopped

Alpha, please, please don't take offence at this but could I make a request that you seek to split your posts into logically organised paragraphs?
<br>
<br>
I really and truly like your writing style. You do have a special way with words. The thought occured to me that maybe one of your goals should be to find the place where you developed that from.
<br>
<br>
What you say makes a *lot* of sense and I very much enjoy reading your posts because so much of my early work relates to what you have to say...  only you express it so much nicer and very much more succinctly.

Hello Frank!
<br>
Its alright Im not offended.I know what you say is true.Sometimes I get a Ilittle carried away in my thoughts as you can see.And I dont really let up.lolYou have to remember Im trying my best here also..Ill keep in mind what you say.
<br>
Hows this.:)The way that I write has alot to do with,how Ive always looked up to people.Throughout my life no matter who they
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///are.no" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 are.No
</a>
matter what they have done to me.I started taking things personal eventually.But still when face to face it was always like that.Its just a bad habit I guess,but it lead me here so maybe its not really all that bad.And this is the reason I think why I am so alergic to negs.(social anxiety).Im learning alot now about myself.
<br>
<br>
When I went to that phychiatrist it taught me
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///something.how" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 something.How
</a>
bad I can be affected by peoples neg taughts.And I taught some more about this and figured out.Why its hard for me to think,and  talk to  most people.Even my own girlfriend.Its all those things they hold against themselves.And other people as well.And maybe against me.
<br>
They are attachments in there body.If they could only see what these things actually look like.Maybe they would let go of there past.But its not easy,But definetely not impossible.I know an excercise that works well.And I feel its the best way to get rid of those attachments.Its in that book I
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///mentioned.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 mentioned.It
</a>
worked for me and so I feel it  will work for anybody.
<br>
<br>
Im sure you know alot about this.But others will read this

 too.Im
</a>
going to be taking another break for few days.After I post one more message.Eventually Ill be able to turn that neg energy into useful energy for myself.Tom posted something on that.I havnt had the chance to read it yet.Right now im pretty new to this and it really stirs me up inside when I encounter them.
<br>
<br>
I had those negs on me for awhile after that visit to that head doctor.And I was completely sucked dry of my energy.Actually I think I made it worst because I started to hate on the guy for what he did.See im no angel.But I have learned that you have to let
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///go.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 go.You
</a>
all read my post above if you are reading this.(The judge and the victim)You see we all have alot of things to deal with in our minds.And you cant get mad at other people,for its not there fault at all.Especially yourself!Be good....

<br>
Another note to you Frank about how I write.I use to chat my life away for more than a few years,I mean everyday all day.hah,well besides when I was working.This helped alot and that place is gone unfortunetely.And I pick up little things here there reading message boards.Ive got alot of other interests besides obes'But not lately ive been sticking around here because I feel this is saving my life...:)See you around!

I too enjoy uour posts, and even more so now that you divide your thoughts into paragraphs.  ANyway, I agree with you that everyone in this forum strives to be peaceful and receptive to one another's thoughts and opinions.  It's obvious that many of us disagree about many things, but a feeling of respect and understanding always permeates the posts.

Good luck with everything...

thanks peacefulwarrior!,you make me feel better about all my posts ive been making.Sometimes I feel as though i take things to far.Its like part of me wants to help,and the other part cant help it.And this combined with promising angels to help.I feel im not in control sometimes and worry about someone taking offence.
<br>
<br>
But I know I shouldnt for I had a dream,telling me.Want to hear it here it goes.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I was buying some sneakers in some kind of foot locker place.And I picked up one of the display boxes.There were lights on the box.And they were burning my hand.And the guy rushed over to me screaming"dude!dude!dude,those have been on all day.I looked at my hand and there was a little burn
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///there.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 there.It
</a>
was pretty deep.
<br>
<br>
So I sat there and thought about what just happened.And I thought I could probably get a free pair of
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///sneakers.so" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 sneakers.So
</a>
I asked for the guys name.And he gave me a card with his name on it.I could tell he was upset about this.And I sat there thinking and I heard myself say"what would the real me do?"
<br>
<br>
I woke up and I played out the rest in my head.And I decided the best thing for me to do was to forget about it.That guy would probably regret this his whole life.And it was something that he really had no control over.I grabbed the box,he wasnt looking at me and didnt see this at
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///all.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 all.It
</a>
wasnt anyones fault.Than I thought he would probably try giving me somethin in return.Than I felt like I shouldnt take it.Because that would mean he was sorry for this and hold on to it till death.For this is something that I would do myself.
<br>
<br>
So the point is if I have nothing but good intentions.And something takes what I say the wrong way and gets angry.That I shouldnt feel sorry because I did not mean this at all.But its hard when you think this way for so long.But I try to remember this everytime I feel like that.
<br>
<br>
Pretty cool huh?When you have dreams like this,try not too look at em so deeply.The point is usually pretty clear.When I first started having them I would look so deep.And nothing would make any sense.

I may be repeating myself on some things.I dont reread what I have posted

<br>
That's SO right, and your phraseology is perfect: the "victim part" doesn't take it lightly at all, does it.
<br>
<br>
And it's a subtle notion you perceived: even if you think you are not listening: your mind is recording everything!!!
<br>
<br>
Please search for a way of dealing with it.

I've been there and, at 17 years of age, it was not nice. No-one seemed to understand and no-one seemed to care.
