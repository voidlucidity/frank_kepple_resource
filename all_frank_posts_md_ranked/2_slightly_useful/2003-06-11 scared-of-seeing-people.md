I've OBE'd once before intentionally.  Since then, I've been able to see through my eyelids occassionally and have had several lucid dreams.  I know now that I could do it whenever I wish, but when I start to try people come up to me and get right in my face and it really scares me.  I more or less get too excited after that happens or scared and I can't get back into it.  Look, I just want to talk to someone.  For the love of God!!!  I'm tired of forums.  I want a live person to share experiences with and get REAL feedback.

One natural aspect of non-physical realms people have to get used to is they are teeming with people of all manner of description. From the utterly frightening to the incredibly informative.

Getting past the fear 'barrier' usually requires some experience. Don't get discouraged. Once you become familiar with the out of body experience then you will intuitively know why those situations are annoying yet not inherently dangerous.

Kozzi i know how you feel. I am alone in my family in terms of the metaphysical, and my number one problem was fear. I lost my fear the first time I was able to suck it up and talk to (WHOM i assume)my spirit guide. When I say that, it sounds easy. Now imagine this. Your in a false environment generated by your mind, like Im at some kind of dock and I had just climbed from the water. I look to my right and in the distance I see a glowing hot pink humanoid figure. it isn't a man or a women, but it had a terrifying smile, a smurk if you will. I then woke up realising I had seen this creature before in past dreams. I finally sucked it up and spoke with this being in my dreams, and it dropped the smurk and lowered its glow. Basically, it said
<b>
 "Do you not fear that which is right? That which is wrong? How can you tell the difference? Is your fear placed correctly?"
</b>
<br>
Now roughly translated, I think he/she was trying to tell me that fear of what I already know is simply idiotic. If you realise this and try to view people with the thought they are not to be feared, I think you won't have a problem.

When you're out of body, what can they hurt? If they cut your arm off, you can just think up another one. When you see somebody OBE (good or evil, alien or human), try to communicate. You might learn something useful or fun.
