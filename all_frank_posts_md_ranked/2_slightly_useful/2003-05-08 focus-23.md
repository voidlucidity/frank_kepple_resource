Could anyone please shortly explain what exactly focus 23 is? I know what focus 10 is, and I have no problems getting there. Is focus 23 far from there?
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,

In short, Focus 23 is the label Monroe attached to one of the lower-level Astral regions.

Hi Truthseeker,
<br>
<br>
Focus 23, as Frank pointed out, is one of many areas of consciousness that Bob Monroe initially labeled as focuses: Focus 10, Focus 15, 23, up to 27. Each focus has its own 'feel', it's own characteristics...and F23 usually means isolation and confusion. Some upon death end up there not knowing they've actually died and left the physical.
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,
<br>
<br>
Ginny
