<section>
Hi. I was curious as to whether when in the astral body, are our pre-existent memories in our brains only or is there actually an 'imprint' of such of our memories on/in our astral bodies.... I'm trying to grasp the whole idea of sensations/emotions/memories, etc in our astral bodies compared to our physical bodies.  Basically, being a science student, I have studied the various sensory systems of the body and how our brain interprets and percieves them...but am finding it diffucult to understand how this is happening in the astral body.
<br>
Once separate from our astral body, do we still remember our memories and feel the same sorts of sensations/emotions when we die and leave the physical realm...

I suggest you read Astral Dynamics. It has what is a basic understanding, which is not such a bad thing to have

depends on what you define as our brains, and if it's that mushy mess of mass between the medula oblongata and the frontal cortex, then the answer is no.

I remember how to read while AP, so we keep our memories.

<section>
We definitely keep memories in the astral.  One reason this forum has been invaluable for me is while in OBE I remember things I read here and they've helped me do things like overcome fear.. fly faster etc.  Often I even remember who posted it.  You dont want to think too much in the Astral but without a doubt you dont forget everything.
<br>
<br>
Ive experienced sadness and fear etc in the Astral so emotions are there, but they are somehow different.  They are not as strong or as overpowering in the astral.  It is as if the emotions are less connected to us.  The only exception I have heard is Love but some people dont consider that an emotion in the same class as the other ones.  It seems fear and love are the strongest.. the others are more tame than in waking life.
<br>
Thats what I've found in my experience anyway.

Hi everyone,
<br>
<br>
My opinion is that in our astral we can remember our past lives but not in our physical body and mind because if we can truly remember everything that happen'd to use in our past live we would go insame.
<br>
<br>
Example: If we died a tragic, horrifing death, or remembering all our wifes and children we had in the past would actuely make us go crazy.
<br>
<br>
Our physical mind and body can't go through that trauma, so its block from our Consciousness.  Some people can pick up little pictures of their past lives.  One example would be the type of clothes you like to wear or the location you live or if you have a flavor for the Orient, or the Old West.  That could be a sign of your past lives.
<br>
<br>
If you want to know your past lives I have a PAST LIFE

<section>
I dunno if we could hold onto our pasts lives... our previous thousand lives experience would bring us to the realization death is a normal process and that we simply loved our previous families, not to mention if we carried on the knowledge from previous lives we would also retain the knowledge we acquire during the "off season".  I think a huge reason for not having access to this is because of the limitations of our storing device.  Your dog may have a soul, but their brain isn't capable of using their soul to its full potential, just the same as the human brain can't.

<section>
According to kabbalistic philosophy we have a mortal memory and an immortal memory. When we die, it is only the immortal memory that survives and this is why we need to regress to remember past lives, as the only memory of them is what was stored in our immortal memory.

i've always thought that our brains were kind of like big receivers that tuned  in to certain information when we needed it.  i think all thought exists somewhere other than the physical, including memory and when we want to access it we just use that part of our brain that scientists/doctors believe we use to store them/it.  kind of like our body uses our brain to interact w/ our mind, which is not 'in our heads'.

fredhedd,
<br>
Years ago I read something about our brains being receivers, and decided to see if I could verify this for myself.  At the time I was changing jobs, and my new job was in a completely new area of technology for me (I did 18 years in Information Technology).  Not knowing how to find stuff to tune into, I started by thinking about how there were people who had this knowledge and applied it daily - so it was "out there" somewhere.  I concentrated on these people, though I had never met any of them, and within minutes I could feel not only the information but usable knowledge downloading into my storage area (I don't know where my storage area is either, but I'm obviously connected to it).  The following week I started my new job and was proficient from day one.

Greetings stevewhite2000,
<br>
<br>
Memories are not stored in the physical brain at all, they are rather stored in the causal body of the causal sphere of the Akasha.
<br>
<br>
As you know, we are all multi-dimensional beings, and it the causal body that is responsible for storing all memories of all lives. As the causal body is a higher body, then the lower bodies, e.g. the Astral body and physical will have access to it to the extent appropriate. It is not until a certain level of evolution has been reached that all memories of all past lives can be reviewed.
<br>
<br>
The physical brain is no more than a receiver for communications from the higher spheres including the causal body and indeed from many other beings as well who, for example transmit inspiration.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I dont know if memories are in "the causal body of the causal sphere of the Akasha", but I do know they are (also) in brains. Crude simulations of a brain have been done on computers using neural networks. They are able to remember some things. Before you say they're just computers, they also forget but are not programmed to do that.

<section>
Though some interesting work is happening in the area of robotics, neural networks, etc., no rigorous computer scientest would say that we've managed to come close to replicating the human brain.  We've built some interesting simulations of it, which is not the same as replication.  And the work is not yet advanced enough to be able to use it or results from it to prove or disprove theories of memory.

I know the simulations dont come close to a real brain. The important part is that a network with dynamic-weight connections can remember and forget. Its a subset of a brains complexity. If a subset can remember, so can the whole.

Just wanted to say I think this is an interesting topic.  I remember hearing something that our brain is similiar to a camera, it's constantly taking "pictures", and these "pictures" are printed into our memory, thus making memories...
<br>
<br>
Well it was something like that...

Hey Everyone,
<br>
<br>
I've been lurking around these forums for a couple monthes now and have read alot of interesting stuff from you fine folks.
<br>
<br>
Regarding memories and the brain,  if you go to
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///www.livingthefield.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 www.livingthefield.com
</a>
you will find alot of interesting stuff pertaining to memories not being stored in the brain but in the Zero Point Field which is, from what I got from the website,  a back drop of energy that permeates the entire universe and keeps every thing connected.  It also explains ESP and other paranormal activity.
<br>
<br>
I think "Zero Point Field" is just a scientific term for Akasha, but that's just my opinion and I'm no expert.

<section>
Greetings Jared,
<br>
<br>
And welcome to the forums!
<br>
<br>
Yes, the "zero point" field is yet another model of the universe, similar to the holographic universe of quantum physics. Incidentally, all of these models substantially agree with each other, and also agree with the most ancient wisdom of the ages.The "field" is indeed the same as the Akasha, the entire universe is one huge, infinite energy field of which we are all integral aspects.
<br>
<br>
The causal sphere is a level of vibration where our higher bodies also exist. The brain is no more than a receiving station, and a computer for controlling the physical body. It is often asked why people lose their memory if they become brain damaged. Quite simply that situation is analogous to a TV set - if a TV receiver becomes damaged it no longer receives signals properly and the sound and pictures become blurred and fuzzy, it really is as simple as that.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your contribution.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Brains arent like a tv. A tv never changes its hardware, but the brains connections between neurons constantly change strength.

yeai know this is an old thread but i love talking about the brain. I think i  know what your getting at here, nueral plasticity, how the actual structure and function of the brain can be changed by the  environment and also by thought.  Its not so much the strength of the connections that make the brain have its ability to change but the number of connections and how well the nuerons are intergrated. the better the nuerons can communicate the more adaptive behaviour you will see.
