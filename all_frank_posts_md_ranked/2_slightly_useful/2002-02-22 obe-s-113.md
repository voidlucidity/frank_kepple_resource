I NEED SOME HELP WITH OBE'S.
<br>
THEY HAPPEN QUITE FREQUENTLY WHEN I'M SLEEPING BUT I'M SCARED TO LET GO. HOW LONG DOES THE PARALYSING SENSATION LAST AND IS IT NORMAL?
<br>
ALSO THE MOST FRIGHTENING FOR ME IS THE FEELING OF FALLING IN WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A VERY DARK TUNNEL.  AND WHY DO I HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME TRYING TO WAKE MYSELF UP.

Take it easy man!
<br>
<br>
Maybe I shouldn't try to help but I can - based on my own limited experiences - give some advice.
<br>
<br>
The vibrational state lasts only for a few minutes. Let it be and relax. It is not dangerous. Above all your inner higher faculties are trigging them! You Are the one that is starting them! When I - at last - trusted myself I went trough the vibrational state as well as the tunnel. And going through that "gate" was very much rewarding.
<br>
<br>
You said you have a problem awaking yourself. But you Are awake! It is just the body that is sleeping. Normally you wouldn't notice that deeply asleep body since sleep - to most people - means loss of consciuosness.
<br>
<br>
So beeing awake in that deep sleep state means that your consciuosness has elevated itself. You have elevated yourself.
<br>
<br>
Now - just relax even more and you will be okay.

I too had the problem of spontaneous OBE's when I was younger.
<br>
I'd wake up paralyzed with a loud siren noise in my head. It's just because your body has shut down its muscles and is asleep. Your astral has released but you're not far enough away from your body and your conscious is kind of caught in between. I'd get a serious headache too from trying to move my arms or get up from this state.
<br>
It's easier to close your eyes and relax your body, and let it take its course. You just happened to wake up in the middle of it!
<br>
This stuff is pretty scarey sometimes. But your still gonna wake up, you won't lose an eye, you can count your fingers and toes, and gas is still $1.50  ... As for falling, it's not that far of a drop... When my body falls asleep, it feels like it dropped about 5 feet. It's alarming at first, but ride it out. It stops quickly.  That is my experience, it took me a while to realize that whatever I felt during the separations, I was not dying...  I always tried to stop everything from happening cause I was worried about not getting back.
<br>
Train yourself to stay calm, under all conditions, I had an easier time after learning this.

The falling sensation is one of the difficult things to become accustomed to as it really does feel like you've just flung yourself from a tall building.  At first it ignites all the bodily fight or flee process.  To overcome it, I went on a high roller-coaster ride fairly regularly until I got bored with all falling sensations.  Now when it happens, at the onset of projection, my consciousness thinks nothing of it.
<br>

Yours,

 This has happened to me on 3 of the last 5 nights - the first time I was pretty scared, now it's just getting old.

Ray-
<br>
I think you'd be suprised to find out how many people would be envious of you...most of us have to induce our OBE's, but you are obviously just waking up during what sounds like an exit....so I echo what the others have said: just relax and let it happen.  There is always a reason that something happens, so try to realize what and why.
