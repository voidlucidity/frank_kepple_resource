Everybody who learns this stuff goes on their own path or spiritual journey and forms their own spiritual theories and beliefs even though a lot of the time they relate to one another and are incredibly similar. My suggestion is to buy the book Astral Dynamics to get a good starter on OBEs and the like. It has a good explanation of remote veiwing which, briefly described, is a weaker form or real-time projection.
<br>
<br>
My highest suggestion however is just to do your own research while still getting overall help from this forum as you go along.
<br>
<br>
Good luck on your quest and I wish you the best for your near-future projections.

Hello and welcome to the forum.
<br>
<br>
Astral projection, remote viewing, near-death experiences, focussed attention, and so forth, are all different aspects of basically the same phenomenon. But in terms of a comparison between what you feel or experience when remote-viewing as opposed to Astral-projecting, the two are very different.
<br>
<br>
As for stuff you can learn now, there are free downloads available on this website. If I remember rightly there was a free e-book about AP which gave some fairly good basic info (Peterson book?). There was a link to another online book on a thread fairly recently which I flipped through and that too had some good basic info.
