<section>
Hello all,
<br>
<br>
My biggest problem isn't so much getting OUT of my body.  My problem is deciding what to do when I'm out!
<br>
<br>
This morning, I got out and basically walked into my kitchen.   My lucidity was good, but my mind was racing full of thoughts.  "Should I go outside and see if I can talk to a neighbor?  Should I ask to communicate with my guide?  Should I try to contact someone in the Astral Pulse message board?"
<br>
<br>
This is a recurring problem with me.  I always seem to get out of my body right where my physical one is laying.  I also always appear to be in a familiar place (like my house, a childhood home, etc).  Does anyone else have this "indecisive problem"?  I think I read somewhere that if you close your eyes and spin while in the astral, it will take you to place.  However, I have a feeling this closing of eyes and spinning will cause me to lose control of my experience and I'll be back in my body.
<br>
<br>
Any ideas as to what we can do once we are "out"?  I would like to talk to some astral entity, but usually, I never see any.  I used to think "Man, once I get ot of body, I'm going to visit this person, and that person, and this country, and that country, etc."  However, once I am out, I seem to just soak up the experience and sit there!  Like flying on top of my roof and smiling at the beauty of everything!  How cheesy!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep smiling,
<br>

Here's a challenge: See if you can have a meta-obe. AP out of the astral body.

Or you could zoom here and help me get out

Greetings Jeff!
<br>
<br>
I think I read in one of Robert's books that he experienced this problem for quite some time as well.
<br>
<br>
If I remember, he finally solved it by picking a point on the horizon, and blasting off towards it as fast as he could.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes it resulted blasting into outer space, but generally eventually resulted in a dimensional/vibrational shift to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Some people have/had (Frank?) the converse problem, and project straight to the Astral and not the "real-time zone". I believe it depends on how you exit - i.e. from a waking consciousness/trance/relaxed state, or from a hypnopombic state, e.g. when waking up early in the morning with mind semi-awake, body asleep.
<br>
<br>
I suggest you read Roberts treatise on OBE downloadable from the file library.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

That's the problem with the RT-zone, once the novelty wears off it can become a little boring. I only learned to project to the RT-zone fairly recently, after having had hundreds of true-Astral adventures. It's nothing compared to the Astral, where you are free to interact with all kinds of resident entities.
<br>
<br>
Basically, you need to learn to project directly to the Astral. If you give me a detailed rundown of your normal projection process I could probably give you some pointers.
<br>

Maybe I'll try that Ralph.  My only problem is that in the past, whenever I have travelled at fast speeds, I lose my vision, become disorientated, and ultimately lose control.  So now whenever I am out, I usually try to stay on the ground and take things slow, because I am afraid (?) that I will end the experience too soon.  Hmmmmm....I never thought I was scared of anything while out, but perhaps that is a passive fear I have which is hindering me - the fear of losing the experience!

I should try that when I get out again.  I found myself in space one time, probably a few miles above the moons surface.  The thing was HUGE and dark.  I had a very empty feeling and a little fear came over me, because it was just this huge rock in the midst of black darkness.  I turned around and looked at the earth below me, and that was very beautiful.
<br>
<br>
I guess I have a little fear of shooting off into space, because the one time I was there, it was very lonely!  I guess the key would be not to stop, but keep going past the fear threshold.

I almost ALWAYS (90-95% of the time) exit right from where my physical body is laying.  So I always find myself in my room, and move out from there.  Even when I went on vacation, I projected out from where I was sleeping in  a tent!  Only a couple times have I gotten out, started flying around in a black void, and then ended up somewhere farther away than my physical body was located.

You know what happens with me?  Let's say that like you, I wanted to go to Japan.  I would start flying SUPER FAST, and in mid flight, my mind goes, "Wow, I am travelling so fast, there is no way in hell that Japan is this far out there!  I should have been there by now.  Where in the hell am I going?"  As you can guess, my heart starts beating fast because of this, and I get tugged back into my body!

Frank,
<br>
<br>
Basically, I always project in my room, although I never have sight right away.  I have to get out of my room, into the hallway, and then it kicks in.  That is usually the case with all my OBE's, so I find myself in my house, and then I have no idea what to do.  There is always the "urge" to sneak into a neighbors house and see what I can see, but even in the astral, that feels so trivial, so I usually stray away from doing that.
<br>
<br>
If you need to know anything else about my experiences, just ask and I'd be glad to share.

In order to give you some pointers, what I need to know is your step-by-step methodology that leads you projecting into your room. With a little change to that, you should be able to project directly into the Astral in a controlled way.

I know absolutely what you mean by travelling at high speed. It's too hit and miss. I used to do this all the time. It was only when I came across Astral Dynamics and this BBS that I began working on slowing things down.

The advice in Astral Dynamics for travelling more than a couple of hundred miles was to jump up into orbit and then come back down to the region of the planet you want to visit. I think that was where I saw it. The problem was with going too far and leaving the solar system instead of just entering orbit.

Well Frank, my methodology to my OBE's are not that hard.  I simply lay down on my back, and do some breathing exercises.  I try to clear my mind, while at the same time, focus on the images that I see before me.  Usually at some point, there is an image or a point of view that I can focus on which becomes almost three dimensional.  When I lock onto an image like that, I almost get pulled into it.  This movement brings my awareness back to my body, but doesn't break my trance.  It is then that I am able to project.
<br>
<br>
Once I am in this state of awareness, I instincively know that I am still in my room.  So when I get up and walk (and usually feel around until I get my sight), I am feeling familiar surroundings in my house.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how else to break down my mrthodology, but I hope that gives you some insight as to how  I start off.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the response.

Ralph,
<br>
<br>
I don't really experience any of those.  Everything *usually* looks the same as the physical environment.  However, sometimes when things look slightly different, it doesn't really register that strongly with me.  For example, if I project into my kitchen and my refridgerator is on the wrong side of the wall, I might simply say to myself, "Hmmmm...that's odd" and then keep doing what I'm doing.  I still know that it's my kitchen, so I don't think anything of it.

Okay, I am fairly certain that what you have described is pretty much the same as I have taught myself to do as a result of slowing down my normal projection process.
<br>
<br>
You say, "When I lock onto an image like that, I almost get pulled into it."
<br>
<br>
That's what you need to do, allow yourself to mentally step into it and you should find yourself standing within the Astral rather than the RT-zone. Your Astral body and the Astral have a biomagnetic attraction that's why you feel the pull.

Ahhh, I think I know what you're saying now.  In other words, when I feel that pull, instead of focusing back to my physical room where I usually project to, just "go" where I am being pulled and see where it takes me.  Right?
<br>
<br>
Now I am all excited to try this and see what happens!  I only hope I can do it without simply projecting to my room, which is what I have been accustomed to doing these past 4 years.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the advice.  I really look forward to all your posts, Frank.

Hey I tried that fly fast trick today. I was here in my house and I started flying away. At first I was at low speed, as fast as a pigeon I guess. I tried everything I could to speed it up... asked for speed, ordered to go faster, tried to do it myself somehow. I was getting disappointed as I thought it would be over and I wouldn't get anywhere, but then my vision became blurry, and I just concentrated on that blurry thing, kinda forcing it to become more and more blurry as if I was really fast. I kept going and then it was all white. All of a sudden I was in front of the world. Not the planet itself but a globe, a very nice and clear scheme of the world. I began to fly around it to randomly choose a place to go and I had some problems getting into the globe cause I was slidding. When I finally thought I had entered somewhere it all went dark. I could see some shady shapes but I thought I wasn't going anywhere and, after sometime I decided it was over. Maybe next time.
