try switching techniques- use the falling till you right before you react then use the rope for a bit- trick yourself to not react.

Hiya Rodentmouse
<br>
<br>
Robert would first say "g'day", offer you some curry, then suggest you practice trance in an upright position.... he is quite strong about this point for trance meditation (but not religious about it) I personally like lying down, but when it is more challenging, sitting up IS good, different focus there too with less of a tendency to "drift off with the fairies."
<br>
<br>
Astral Dynamics, or his online treastise, will give you more ideas, suggestions, reasons why, and advice, etc.
<br>
<br>
Good luck,
<br>
Cheers

Hello Rodentmouse, everyone,
<br>
<br>
I'm going to take some time with this one because it is a CLASSIC.  This is the turning point . . . at the point of trancing or "falling," either we are going to OBE or we aren't. Some thoughts on this one - -
<br>
<br>
1.  Make sure you are actually relaxed.  Sometimes you only think you are relaxed, when there is some knot or other point of tension hiding in your body and messing you up.  INDULGE yourself in yoga, chiropractic, MASSAGE (yes! yes!), physical therapy, hot tubs, bathtubs, milk and cookies, sex, whatever it takes.  I cannot emphasize this more.  One does not WORK at having an OBE; one instead ALLOWS oneself to have an OBE!  (Repeat this 100 times then proceed!).
<br>
<br>
2. Eliminate as many stressors in your life as you can:  abusive bosses, dreadful spouses, vampiric friends.  Use this new-found free time to slather affection on children and animals and people who bring you peace and contentment (this process will take several months). Thank the Universe for its blessings.  THEN . . . . .
<br>
<br>
3.  Did you know that the "oh goodie" response you get when you feel yourself falling is actually a stress response?  That it produces tension?  That's why it screws you up!!!!  I know this because I have so many "oh goodie!" moments that screw ME up . . . in fact I ruined an OBE last night.  There are many spiritual practices out there (Buddhism comes to mind) that teach non-attachment, and now I FINALLY know what they mean, and why it is important.  SO . . . .
<br>
<br>
4.  Try to practice non-attachment.  By that I mean, don't attach yourself to outcomes, just stay as aware and observant as you can while you meditate, relax, meditate, relax, meditate, relax . . . .  This works with  both OBEs and with  life in general.  If you have a pre-OBE "moment," allow yourself not to care whether you OBE or not.  If it doesn't happen, shrug and continue to meditate for its own sake.  There is always the next moment . . . .
<br>
<br>
NAMASTE

Tisha those are great suggestions, especially number 2 (even though I'm not keen on either children or animals
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;). I need to "destress" in normal waking life a
<i>
 lot
</i>
more!
<br>
<br>
RM, my only suggestions as a novice myself are :-
<br>
- you have to be fully and totally relaxed, to the point where your body is falling asleep and your limbs feel heavy and dead. Once you can do this, and then quiet the mind, trance comes quickly. Even hidden eyelid tension can stop this though. BTW I don't use a falling technique; it usually keeps the mind active when I want it to shutup and get to Alpha.
<br>
- I'm also still getting past the mental "flutter" once in trance, although I'm used to trance now and my nervous rush comes when I start feeling limbs separating. Despite my very best intentions to calm down, for some reason I keep getting nervous. To get past the nervous "flutter" when entering trance, maybe focus your mind on a single thought that takes you into trance. This is how I quiet my mind after the body is asleep. The thought should be primitive and gentle, not something that stirs up other thoughts. I repeat the word "maranatha" slowly internally - the sound keeps my mind mildly alert and if I ignore everything else that happening I soon find I'm in a light trance with good bodily sensations.
<br>
- Last resort is to use an aid. I started getting into trance with Lucid Bird's Trance Induction CDs, only coz RB mentioned them on the boards one time. They're excellent - I got a light trance the first time I listened. Once you can recreate the body conditions at will, you won't need the music.
<br>
<br>
Hope it helps mate..

I still get the nervous flutter now and again if i start to feel exit symptoms or my mind slips into a trance...and yeah it gets annoying because it draws you back instantly
<br>
but the more you do it the faster you can recover from the nervous feeling that you get
<br>
but mainly
<br>
there will be one time every few times where you keep perfect control and you will have the experiences then
<br>
<br>
like sometimes i still respond just like its the first time im feeling these things and i freak out even though ive felt these things a million times
<br>
<br>
i guess sometimes it just comes easy..sometimes it doesnt

Tisha, is this something you have just realised recently, or have you known about the issues raised in your points for some time?
<br>
<br>
If these are issues you've known about for some time then you won't be needing any reinforcement. But if it's something that came to you fairly recently, I just wanted to say that you are *absolutely* on the right track.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Hello again,
<br>
<br>
In response to Frank's question . . . how do I know how do I know how do I know . . . don't know how I know . . . HM.   I've only been aware of my OBEs for a few weeks now and I've botched every attempt (due to the thrill of it) since I figured it out.  So I cannot claim to be an expert at the conscious OBE.
<br>
<br>
But I do know something about LIFE . . . and about magical/spiritual  development (18 years of it) . . .  Following the "as above, so below" axiom, and paying close attention to my life's path and where it has led me . . . well it all just makes sense.  Many sorcerers and  mystics have emphasized that psychic abilities are a BYPRODUCT of energy development, not the goal.  The OBE is probably just another of the many byproducts of magicla/spiritual/psychic/energy work.  BINGO!  MAJOR LIGHTBULB MOMENT!   SOOOOO . . . following this logic . . .
<br>
<br>
If you focus on achieving "OBE skills" instead of on the (life-changing) spiritual work that brings them on, you've kind of missed the point, and you'll get frustrated when an OBE doesn't happen for you.  OR, if you have OBEs and then get too attached to the OBE experience (rather than to the spiritual/energy work that allowed you to have it), you'll lose the ability to have them.  Which brings me where I am today . . . . ouch . . .
<br>
<br>
Hence, the Buddhist admonition of nonattachment.  I bet there are happy Buddhist priests OBEing all over the Astral.  Anyone run into any of them lately?
<br>
<br>
yours,
<br>
tisha
