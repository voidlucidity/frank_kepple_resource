Well I'd like to comment on this...
<br>
The astral matter...as I'm able to discern...is made up of a type of atomic structure that is undeniable with my vocabulary.  It is a substance that is lighter than atoms. It is so subtle, that by looking at it you can move it.  Best way to describe it is like a big cumulous white cloud. It is the fog (just above the ground) you may see in the early morning.  Also, the astral is stratified. We in part of it on earth. So much of what we see on earth has their equivalents on the astral. When you wake up in a dream (lucid dreaming) you see a dreamscape. When you take control of the dream...and firmly state that its a dream...you will see how the dreamscape will dropdown (like a curtain on a stage) leaving only the white clouds of the astral substance. This stuff is so friggen fragile that your subconscious thoughts can be displayed on it (like a movie screen reflecting the movie projection) and you can, if you are lucid enough, alter the image.  So, to answer your question, the astral is a stratified (light to heavy - subtle to dense) living material that reacts to our thoughts.  By comparison, it's like the Matrix or a hologram. We project what we need to advance our awareness of the Source and to grow spiritually.

Physical things react the same way (telekinesis), but they're so dense that our psychic thoughts have little effect. It could have a structure similar to(but lighter than) atoms, as you said. It might even be made of the same particles (quarks), but with less density and more quantum entanglement.

It is a vibration of existance.  As is the Physical plane (albeit a lower vibrational state).  The Astral has regions to it, like layers (an infinite number of layers, but it has distinct regions).
<br>
<br>
Now to go way out in left field, the Physical plane reflects what is on the Astral, not the other way around.  What does that imply?  Thought=Reality on the Astral, of which the physical plane is a reflection.  Yes, your thoughts affect the physical plane just as they do the Astral Plane (although not as fast, but things are speeding up).

Is it true that you are looking on the astral when you use your imagination?

Yes, if there is an afterlife, then the astral
<i>
 is
</i>
where we go when we die physically.  The places where people go when they AP are what you would call the "afterlife" (if there is one).

The astral plane is a very real,
<i>
 non
</i>
spactial plane of exestance. It is true it is just vibrating at a diffrent speed, than what can be preceived with our 5 sences.
<br>
<br>
The astral plane is a place where all energy (spirits, souls, life forces what ever you want to call them)  beings go to in there sleep. Were talking animals, children, i beleive even plants, and inatament objects occupy this space in harmony with out physical exestance.
<br>
<br>
youve been there before, and youll go there again, and i think that this plane may not be the afterlife, but somthing very close.
