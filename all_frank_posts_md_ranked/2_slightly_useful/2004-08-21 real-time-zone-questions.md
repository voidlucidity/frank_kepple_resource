If the real time zone reflects the physical plane almost exactly, then shouldn't you be able to see many people walking about doing their daily lives, which would lead to further moral and ethical dillemas of visiting celebrities houses or seeing your neighbour naked...Can anyone fill me in on what really happens?

In a recent book I read, the authro claimed that the astral state was similar to hypnosis, and that our ethics would still bind us. I don't know if I've ever been bound before though. However, with astral sight things are different anyway. For instance, if I'm projecting early in the morning and my son is up watching cartoons, his clothing, to my astral sight is somewhat subjective, and I may only get the color right, and not what he's actually wearing. I think if you actively went to spy on someone it would be somewhat similar. I don't think you'd be able to see another person as you would perceive them in the waking world, thus limiting the odds of your arousal of spying on someone in the RTZ. This might be different if you are an accomplished projecter with very heightened astral senses, but I'm not that good, and there's a million other things more interesting to do than spy. [

] I think you'll see other astral things far more clearly than anyone in the RTZ.
<br>
<br>
Again, this is just based on my own experiences, and others will probably differ.

You mean the physical world is a reflection of the Astral [

Echoes.  It's about echoes.  A house ahs been there 20 years.  A person walks by and has been there 3 seconds, not much of an echo.  It's also why you see things that used to be there.  In 'reality', you simply need to adjust your "when" sense, think about it.

When projecting, you are thinking on a much deeper level.

You will not bother trying to spy on your naked neighbour

<br>
Yes, here's what really happens:
<br>
<br>
Concepts such as ethics and morals are physical-world notions only. Within the non-physical environment there are none. While there are those who would no doubt try to persuade you otherwise, members of your own higher self in particular, everyone is free to basically run rampant as and however they choose, within a sphere of reality of their own making, for as long as they like... literally.
<br>
<br>
Consciousness within the non-physical, to an accomplished person, is
<i>
 exactly the same
</i>
consciousness that person has while within the physical. Anyone who would write otherwise, say, as the poster mentioned about reading a book where the author compared non-physical consciousness to hypnosis... it is nothing remotely like hypnosis, and anyone who would write such a thing in a book obviously has some way to go.
<br>
<br>
An accomplished projector can, in theory, spy on people naked in the physical. But anyone who has trained their mind to accomplish such a feat as proficient real-time projection: simply would never think about it. Ideas such as looking at your neighbour naked, for example, is nothing more than ego-driven tittle tattle which an accomplished projector would have long-since left behind.
<br>
<br>
In any event, the whole concept of nakedness is an exclusively physical world construct; and the whole notion of "celebrity" is about as ego-driven a construct as it is possible to get. Which, again, a truly accomplished projector would naturally never dream about getting themselves involved with.
<br>
<br>

I never planned to do anything like that, I was just thinking about whether or not it would be possible to do something like that.

I once read an account by a projector who stated that she was unable to enter a room - she later found out that the people in the room had been engaged in something very private, and concluded that their unconscious desire for privacy had manifested in the RTZ as the barrier she was unable to pass through.
<br>
<br>
It's kinda interesting that people seem wore worried about projectors being able to enter their house and see them naked than about projectors being able to enter and affect their dreams. . .

Yea shielding is very good if you want to keep projectors out.
