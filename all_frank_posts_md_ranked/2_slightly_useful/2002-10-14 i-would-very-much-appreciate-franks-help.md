Dear Frank,
<br>
I have been reading your technique where you focus on your third eye and raise your consicousness, you say something about the crown chakra, could you please explain what you do to raise consciousness, also do you raise it upwards, or out of your crown chakra.  Could someone please explain how to, and what is  phasing.
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
M

Phasing is a method of Astral projection. The technique is based on the idea of simply allowing your physical body to go to sleep, however, as you do so, you keep a conscious connection with your mind rather than simply blinking out like you'd normally do. Doing this allows you to remain conscious at all times during the process.
<br>
<br>
As you phase away from the Physical, your focal point of consciousness becomes attuned to different regions of consciousness that are called Focus levels. The technique was founded by R Monroe who wrote several books about his Astral adventures. The best of which (IMO) are Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey. Plus, there's lots of information on the Internet that you might find useful.
<br>
<br>
Some of my early posts to this BBS are about the time when I was first experimenting in finding a more controlled Astral projection process. I was practicing moving my focal point of consciousness to different areas of my head and body in order to try and find some kind of mental switch that would swap me from Physical to Astral. As a result of those early experiments, I began to work on perfecting what I now call my Phasing technique which is descibed above.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

So is phasing simply a case of trying to stay mentally awake, or is there something you have to do? What is your phasing technique?
<br>
Thanks.

My technique is based on the Gateway Wave 1 CD from the Monroe Institute. But you can basically use any kind of meta-physical imagery as a portal. If you use the search facility to read through some of my more recent past posts I think they should give you a good idea.

Yours,
