I have just realized this month that I have had numerous OBE's without being able to actually "fly". Here lately I am not as nervous and I can go about my room. I am sooo aware that I am doing this that as soon as I think of my body "snap" it's over. My question is , since I am very aware this is happening how do I control how long I can stay OBE? Also one more question, I have read that it takes a lot more energy to project in RTZ. Is this true? I know that I am always in RTZ. I guess that would explain why I am always so tired. I think that being able to have an OBE is a true gift. Can everyone do it, or are we very special people?

Everyone projects to some non-physical realm, or other, while they are asleep. The core challenge is to become aware of it. I'm not sure if you realise this or not, but picturing your physical body is a good way of getting back to the Physical environment. From what you say, this appears to work particularly well for you. So the simple answer, I guess, would be to avoid thinking about it.

real-time zone. you can find all the features of the physical there, like the pyramids at giza, your neighbors house, or things in space, etc., but it's experienced with a body similar to your astral body, and in an astral-like environment, ie very fluid.
