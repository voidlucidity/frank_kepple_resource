I searched some posts here but didn't find the info I wanted.
<br>
<br>
Basically since I have been meditating, raising energy, astral projecting, my senses have improved tremendously.  Well when I woke up about 6 hours into sleeping I heard a soft music playing somewhere.  It sounds like something you'd hear in a old church or movie.  It was a choir of(masculine) voices just singing, "eeeee aaahhh laaaaa ohhh"(not exactly those sounds but you get my point).  I was awake for about a minute or so with my eyes open and then it ended.  It was quite comforting.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone experienced this?  I would assume it was from either Jesus or a guardian angel...

Hello:
<br>
<br>
How you interpret the phenomenon is down to you. If you subscribe to notions of Jesus and angels and stuff, then you will obviously interpret your experiences in those terms. But hearing music is very common. All you need do is mentally float around somewhere and think of your favourite piece of music and, hey presto, up it comes as if from nowhere.
<br>
<br>
As the Major has already pointed out, the experience tends to be far more meaningful when compared to how we typically experience music within what we call the physical.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Yeah that's what it was!!!  It was quite pleasant.
<br>
<br>
So what your saying is that instead of feeling the emotion my mind turned it into a sound?  And like I said I wasn't projecting or anything at the time I was awake.

I have Yesterday on my computer but I never heard the other one.  I think I understand what you are saying.
<br>
<br>
Actually before I went to sleep I was crying because of something that had been going on with a friend and I am almost over it now.  Maybe that was either myself or another being comforting me.  And just a feeling of relief.  Today I felt VERY relieved where I have been kinda bothered by this for a week or so.

I think the music is similar in origin to "musicogenic epilepsy" as I wrote about it before. The pre-OBE states show many signs of self-induced temporal epilepsy, and the music is most likely an expression of the seizure itself.
<br>
<br>
The music suppose an increased brain activity in the temporal lobe where the auditive cortex resides and the brain forced to interpret this activity as music. I rather wonder why this music ceases briefly after separation.
<br>
<br>
Mostly I hear classical pieces but in a frightening episode of sleep paralysis once I've heard Prodigy. So the emotional connection is very likely. I think hearing wind like noises and music before separation have the same origin since it is very easy to decompose the music into a pulsating static noise.

Not to ramble but in this book Spirit Guides by Iris Belhayes it states that we choose what we want our lives to be before we are born into this world(maybe its true, I don't know).  And this same thing has happened with almost all the friends I have had throughout my entire life and this last time it hurt a little more.
<br>
<br>
So like you said maybe I accomplished something on a soul level.
<br>
<br>
Oh and I know what your talking about with hearing astral noises before separation.  I have experienced that before with wind and a "demon" yelling at me.  Maybe this was like that only positive sounds but it seemed more meaningful.

Markulous,
<br>
<br>
I have heard choir-type sounds several times in my astral experiences.
<br>
I believe they are a signpost that reflects a specific plane or subplane.
<br>
For example, once I was visiting with guides (unintentionally) They had something to inform me to get me on a better path. After that visit and on the return to physical consciousness I heard the choir-type sounds for a few seconds. So I presume that somewhere between this "wise" realm and the Earth realm is a signpost that has this characteristic sound.

Hey Tom,
<br>
<br>
The track I have mentioned is 'Break &amp; Enter.' There is an effect of door opening. That part.

I have this album in mp3 and for some weird reason I like it. It is weird because I try to be away from destructive things and apparently this music is very destructive. But in the first place, it is full of primal energy (sort of an industrial power) that can be used for other purposes.
<br>
<br>
BTW I've heard other concrete music from Madonna to Mozart. The most beautiful I could name was a jazz remix of Pachelbel's Canon.
<br>
<br>
In my first years I've heard only Gregorian type music. I think this music is the most closest to the composite noises. For me symphonic orchestration is the most common. I like to remix them on fly.

Mendel, I suppose higher beings induce music indirectly by manipulating our emotiosphere. Also there are beautiful places out there where the landscape emanate music. I think music is only one part of our unconscious attempt to interpret complex states.
