This is going to sound pretty tame to those of you who are experienced but it's a great achievement for me.
<br>
<br>
I was meditating but had actually been drifting in and out of sleep.  I had done all the rope, swing, jump exercises and had given up just to keep a blank mind.  I kept pulling myself out of sleep, telling myself I was supposed to be meditating not sleeping.  At one point I felt the familiar tingling in my body.  I knew -  this is it.  I got a moment of fear and held on, the tingling started to subside but I then said to myself  "it's now or never, if I come across something I don't like then I'll just have to deal with it" I relaxed and let go saying to myself "I trust in God, I trust in God I trust in God..."  Over and over – I was frightened, I couldn't help it.  The tingling had increased to a frenzy,  I felt like every darn nerve in my body was 'zinging' and vibrating, at sonic speed.  Just when I thought it was getting too much for me, it stopped.  Everything was quiet.  I thought "darn it didn't work".  Then, after a moment, I had this weird 'heavy' sensation like I was being sat upon by another body.  My legs flattened then my stomach, my chest – it didn't hurt and I didn't mind but it was heavy and usually the sort of thing that would have panicked me.  I was trying to figure out what was going on.  I felt all these things happening yet I couldn't see much.  I did see my lower legs move when they were being flattened and I had an image of my stomach being flattened but I think now, that is only because that is what it felt like.  I had no astral sight.  My mind was totally confused as to where I was, here or there, lying on the bed or off it.  I just didn't know what was going on.  Suddenly there is the loud sound of smashing glass, I got a shock, I suddenly see that my bedroom door is open and I think "Oh No, my partner has come home early, he's angry that he has caught me sleeping and has smashed something against the wall to wake me up!"  (something he would never do) Then I look further into the hall (don't know how I could do this when I am lying on the bed) and I see a policeman.  All this time I am struggling to get awake and it's really difficult, I couldn't get myself together, I was panicking trying to wake up.  I was wondering what the policeman was doing in my house, then I remembered the sound of broken glass, somebody must have broken in and I'm in such a deep trance I cant hear anything.  I finally manage to wake myself up and leap out of bed – there is nobody there...  Darn Astral tricks!!!!
<br>
<br>
I am so happy though, I experienced the exit.   It's like a confirmation for me, I was getting discouraged with my practice and thinking it would never happen and then even doubting if it was possible. The exit wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and hopefully I wont have that fear barrier next time.  What I never expected was the confusion of separation, my mind could not grasp what was going on.  I think in hindsight I left my body and a moment later got back into it (the feeling of being sat upon) then gained some astral sight and was then interrupted by those astral tricks.  And perhaps deep down I was feeling guilty for taking time out to meditate when I had a million things to do this afternoon.  Did I create the Policeman?
<br>
<br>
Amazingly a minute later my partner called and asked if I had called him.

Aaaahhhh man! Cool! It sounds like you were really OB and laying on yourself (hee hee! I always find it funny to think of us squashing ourselves, breathing down our own necks, being afraid of our own shadows....  Might not be funny in person but I love the thought)
<br>
<br>
I was really bumming last night because I was trying to hold a blank mind, get some vibrations or something, and couldn't.  Sometimes a reminder like your post is what helps me remember that persistence pays off -
<br>
<br>
I am so excited for you!

You described the typical confusion that can arise, perfectly.
<br>
<br>
Beforehand, many people say things like, "Oh, I'm not scared, I'll have no fear" etc,. etc. Which is SO darned easy to say but it can be *very* difficult to control things at first.
<br>
<br>
The sense of conscious awareness you take with you to the Astral, as you now realise, is the very same as you have on the Physical. Instantly, the moment you set foot on the Astral, for about the first ten or twenty times you project, it behaves like a fish out of water.
<br>
<br>
It is very normal to hear all kinds of sounds. Like pops, bangs, crashes, tearing and ripping noises, and so forth. What happens is your conscious awareness instantly gives you an idea of what may have caused the sound...
<i>
 just like it would do on the Physical
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, you have to teach it that all these kinds of sounds, when on the Astral (or when undergoing separation, etc.), are all very normal. Which does take a little time.
<br>
<br>
You heard a sound which your conscious awareness instantly thought it recognised as smashing glass. This immediately led to a wacky moment, where you think you are being broken into in the physical.
<br>
<br>
You first think of your partner and dismiss it. However, thoughts of this person, when released on the Astral, can have quite a profound subsequent effect. Searching for some kind of security, under the circumstances, you create an image of a policeman. All of which looks SO real, at the time.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

let me contribute my weird experience this morning-i woke early and felt tense, did a lot of energy stuff and did not get relaxed enough to try to obe, did not wake up on first alarm, but between alarms found myself going obe with only one leg seperated and twirling around, in the meantime my daughter comes home from her overnight and brings her friends because i hear them talking(this is an auditory hallucination). i heard weird sounds before so i was not surprised. but i give up projecting because i know the clock is gonna go off again. when was the full moon anyway?
