<section>
I've listened to wave 1 excercise 2 now on many occasions. Typically I listen to it on returning home from work, or at the weekend when I'm nicely relaxed. (I've tried several times to wake myself up at 2 or 3am and give it a go, but I normally end up just turning the alarm clock off and rolling over !)
<br>
<br>
I've noticed so far that there are typically one of 4 outcomes to the exercise :
<br>
1) I fall asleep, and then awaken to Monroe's voice at the end saying "breath deeply, stretch your arms and legs". This normally happens 5% of the time.
<br>
2) I am disturbed by a noise or something else; or I can 'feel' that there will be no positive outcome to the exercise, so I give up about 2/3rds of the way through (25% of the time)
<br>
3) I have some sort of "success" (10%)
<br>
4) I complete the exercise, but feel nothing has happened (60%)
<br>
<br>
Ok, lets focus on number 3. My successes are nothing significant to date. I've seen 3d blackness a couple of times, I've also seen a fair bit of imagery behind my eyelids...Most recently, I could conjure up faces, objects etc. There were also scenes / faces appearing that I definitely did not conjure up. Apart from that - nothing else.
<br>
<br>
But I'm not giving up just yet!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my question is on how the exercise is used, hopefully a few of you guys can give me some pointers ! I've been using an "imaginary scenario" as per Frank's post a while back...But I haven't had any noticeable success with that technique, and I find that it is quite hard mental work to follow the scenario through, so I often stray from it.
<br>
<br>
I've also just been lying back, relaxing, and trying to "do" the exercises Monroe guides you through (energy conversion box, resonant tuning, declaration, relaxation). By doing this, and not really engaging my imagination at all, I seem to be having the "successes" I mentioned above, but not progressing any further.
<br>
<br>
Re. Frank's technique - am I going about it in the right way ? I feel that if I was doing it correctly, I would have more success by now !!
<br>
<br>
Help !! anyone got any ideas ?
<br>

hi clandestino,
<br>
<br>
re Frank's technique, I think it is important to keep in mind what Robert Bruce talks about regarding visualization. That is, visualization is definitely not always visual, nor does it have to be. If you are one of the majority, like me, visualization is extremely difficult. You feel like you can't really "see" anything, and you spend so much energy trying to make it more real that you wind up not being able to do anything else, or running out of energy or getting bored and going to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I think the most important thing in any technique is actually the way it makes you FEEL. For instance someone might recommend you imagine yourself lying on the beach with the hot sun looking down, the crashing of the waves, etc. There is only one purpose to this. To make you feel relaxed and warm. It really makes no difference if you can visualize a beach or not. The idea is that imagining the scenario in your mind will help you to create warmth and relaxation in your body.
<br>
<br>
That said, I can't visualize for the life of me. What I'm starting to discover is that I CAN reproduce feelings and sensations and emotions. This is the key. If you are getting to the point where you can see faces, hypnagogic imagery, etc. then you are doing well. Keep practicing. And focus on the effect (the way you feel) and not so much on the method. The method is, after all, just a method.
<br>
<br>
hope this helps....
<br>

<section>
Thanks Ash. I definitely need to focus more on the feeling / imagining instead of visualizing. Typically I'll spend a lot of the exercise trying to visualize, and then "feel" with my mind sporadically, just for good measure...This might be where i'm going wrong.
<br>
<br>
cheers !

Mark:  It's been a long time since I've used Wave 1 (I've been playing with Waves 5 &amp; 6 for a long time now).  I'm only just beginning to really understand how limiting our expectations are in these matters.  Reread your post.  I'm not being critical here, but I find what you say to be so much like my experiences (until recently) with the TMI Gateway tapes.  You say you're not "successful."  "No positive outcome."  "Nothing has happened."  Monroe was very careful NOT to tell you what you should expect or give you any indicators of how to evaluate your "success" or "failure."  I'm only just beginning to learn (5 years after first experimenting with the tapes) that what we think of as "failure" or "nothing" may be a very important step in our process.  Lately I've experienced no imagery, for example.  Just a blank screen.  Do you know how many meditators work for years for the Holy Grail of "a blank screen"??  My advice (offered most humbly and with a lot of empathy for your situation) ~ is ~ to use whatever comes up.  View it as you would a dream.  It's a given.  It means something.  It's leading you somewhere.  I think you're doing great.  Just keep at it!

Hi, clandestino
<br>
<br>
Two things you might like to try:
<br>
<br>
1 Try the deep breathing / muscle exercises, mentioned in the workbook from the main website here, either just before the exercise or as a separate exercise. I find this usually produces some effect, typically a very bright green light.
<br>
<br>
2 Try imagining that you are in a particular location, either a place yopu have visited or an imaginary one, eg from a game or movie.  See if you can visualize moving around in the scenery.
<br>
<br>
Blessings

hi Do,
<br>
you said
<br>
"Reread your post. I'm not being critical here, but I find what you say to be so much like my experiences (until recently) with the TMI Gateway tapes. You say you're not "successful." "No positive outcome." "Nothing has happened." Monroe was very careful NOT to tell you what you should expect or give you any indicators of how to evaluate your "success" or "failure.""
<br>
<br>
This is a very fair point. I woke up the other morning with the strong conviction that my expectations of success, and my beliefs, are hindering me. It is quite frustrating, because I can't see a way I can change this at the moment.
<br>
<br>
Brianspuk : I'll give it a go, and let you know how i get on !
<br>
cheers folks,

Call me sad but AP has become such a part of my life that I'm almost always asleep by about 10pm and naturally awaken about 4am.

<br>
As to:
<br>
<br>
1) this happens to me with about the same frequency, funnily enough.
<br>
<br>
2) I get this now and again, say, when the dogs start barking at the foxes and it just disturbs me to the extent where I simply can't ignore it. Or maybe I get the need to use the bathroom, or whatever. My solution in this instance is to simply cancel the current session, sort out whatever it is, then start afresh.
<br>
<br>
3) Not bad at all.
<br>
<br>
4) Right, this is the most important point you raise in that 60% of the time you complete the exercise.
<br>
<br>
Please understand that I hardly ever project when listening to the CD. Sometimes I get to the stage where I would like to, but resist the temptation and complete the exercise. I found that the CD was a great primer. What I'd also do, often, is play Track 2 on repeat while I was asleep. Just on a very low volume.
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what headphones you have but I use these really lightweight internal-ear ones that I can sleep fairly comfortably whist wearing. Also, early on I burnt a copy of track 2 on a recordable CD so as to protect the original (as I was playing it so many times).

Well, that's getting there. What you are describing with the scenes and faces is more a Moen-school experience which I reckon is a handy pointer that you are making some kind of progress.

<br>
<br>
Then simplify it to the point where you can follow whatever imagery you conjure up. The imagery itself is not important. I have experimented with all kinds of stuff. One of the simplest scenarios I tried was where I imagined Monroe was standing on stage dictating the whole rundown, and I was part of the "audience". During which time it got a bit freaky because it became such that I felt Monroe was actually there, on stage, and all the other audience members were sitting around me. And here's me thinking, no, hang on a minute, I should only be imagining this!
<br>
<br>
But after a while that's truly how it becomes. Like, you get the feeling you can use whatever scenario. In the sense that you just take whatever you are mentally presented with and use that.
<br>
<br>
You see, I ever so strongly feel that successful Astral Projection depends not so much on having the right "technique"... but on having the right kind of mental understanding as to how these techniques can be utilised. As it seems to be the case that once you find one technique that works, then virtually any technique can work.

<br>
<br>
By actually doing the exercises you are engaging your imagination. But more so in a way you, yourself feel comfortable with. So it probably doesn't feel so much, to you, like you are making anything up. But that's great. As the important thing is to find a way that works for you.

<br>
making the realization is the first step. second is letting go of those things that are hindering you (ie expectations and old belief patterns. Why don't you put them in your energy conversion box? that's what it's for!
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
What goes along with this, at least for me, is the need to control. I find myself trying really hard to make THIS listening the BIG SUCCESS! I must do it this time or not at all. This is clearly counter-productive. Try adopting a more relaxed attitude about the whole thing. Just relax and go with the flow. Whatever happens is gonna be the best thing for you at this time, even if you don't feel anything happening. (this belief is what you can use to replace your old expectations). After all, what difference does it really make if you listen to the tape a few more times and nothing happens?
<br>
<br>
good luck!
