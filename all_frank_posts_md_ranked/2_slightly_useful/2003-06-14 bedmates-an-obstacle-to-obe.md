I have a question for those who have successfully projected.
<br>
Can you project if you are in physical contact with another person or even a pet?
<br>
<br>
I had an experience a couple weeks ago where I felt sort of loose in my body after some body-rush type vibrations.  I felt like I might be able to project.  But I was also very aware that my wife was spooning me and had her arm around me.  It seemed to be a barrier to my projecting.
<br>
<br>
Also, sometimes my wife travels on business.  But when she is gone, the dogs inevitably sleep on the bed.  They don't

me.[:O]
<br>
But when they curl up, then tend to do it leaning against me.  Everytime they breathe or pant or move to a new postion, it distracts me.
<br>
<br>
I could just shut them out of the bedroom, but then they would pace back and forth in front of the door whining.
<br>
<br>
This has long been a problem.  There's nothing like being seated in deep meditation, and having your Newfie/St Bernard Mix saunter up and begin lapping aggressively at your ear.

Hmmm...
<br>
No responses.
<br>
I guess everyone is sleeping alone.

I've often wondered about this topic myself.  I live alone and I quite often have OBEs, visions and lucid dreams at night time.  Most of my friends are couples and the number one advice I would give them if they want to have an OBE is to sleep alone.  I can't imagine having the solitude and complete quietness to leave my body if I had someone next to me.  Sometimes I even feel it is a barrier if one of my limbs is touching up against one of my other limbs - for instance a foot resting against the opposite leg.
<br>
<br>
Anyway - just my 2 cents.  I'd like to hear what all the partnered people out there think on this.

Thanks for your two cents, Linda.  I guess maybe I should take advantage of the times when my wife is traveling and lock the dogs out of the room when I want to practice having a OBE.
<br>

Hey!  I noticed that you live in Saskatchewan.  My wife and I ran out of gas in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan when we were driving back to Maine from Alaska.  The people there were friendly.  I thought that the name sounded like something from Loony Toons.  Like someplace that Daffy Duck would refer too.

Lasher,
<br>
<br>
I am married and we have three cats who also like to sleep on the bed. I have to get up and go in the spare room and shut the door. That's the only way anything happens. If I try to project in bed with the wife and cats there, which I have done from time to time, invariably the wife will move, or one cat will attack the other, etc., so it doesn't work for me there.
<br>
<br>
Very best,
</section>

Hello Lasher
<br>
In the past, until we had a talk about it my wife and I had some sort of physic  connection. I'll try and explain during my AP/obe practises I would be in meditaion trance and sence that my wife is coming into the room, I would sit up and wait and within a minute  she would come in. She said it was because I called her, sort of!!
<br>
Another time after our talk I said I was going to bed early to AP/obe. I was successful in that I was a ball of consciousness surrounded by a blue electrical shield this has happened once before but this time my wife unbeknown to me had come to bed and rolled over putting her arm over me, this brought me back to the physical. I have a large family and have found it hard to find quite times, so instead of retreating  I started practising in the lounge room with the tv on and five kids running around everywhere. I can while in this setting have astral visions and fill the astral body moving, loud astral noises etc, once my astral head came out, forward. So to answer your question partners can cause frustration but if prepared for noises and such you can in my opinion AP/obe anywere. But having physical contact is very distracting, I'm yet to have any success when touched constantly, as  in spooning.
<br>
Good luck Lasher

I have had a few OOBE's while sleeping next to someone, and once i woke up from a violent dream and punched my boyfriend square in the nose. I think he kept his physical distance after that...lol
<br>
<br>
I think that as long as your bed partner isn't draping a sleep-heavy arm or leg over you all night, you should be able to acheive an OOBE. I have the wildest dreaming experiences when I have house guests actually, especially other women who like to dream. So, I have a feeling that dreaming can be affected by the energy of the people around you, which could be great if they are also into OOBE's and lucid dreams.

<section>
Thanks for the feedback Nick and ChromeKnight.
<br>
I definitely think I am going to try locking the critters out of the bedroom when I practice.
<br>
<br>
Amber, your comment about punching your boyfriend in the nose (ouch!) made me think of an odd occurence I had once a long time ago.
<br>
<br>
I had read that sometimes we store stress or negative energy in parts of our bodies and that it can lead to sickness.  So one time when I was meditating, I asked my body to try to release any pent up negative energy that I'd been storing.  I said that I was willing to have my body move or twitch or whatever else might help to let go of the negative energy.
<br>
<br>
Nothing dramatic happened at the time.  But a day or two later my wife says she woke up to see me kneeling on the bed, facing my pillow, and sort of rocking back and forth slamming my forearms into my pillow.  She also says that I was laughing.  At the time, she was quite startled and said to me, "Dave, what are you doing?!!".  I apparently slid back into a sleeping position on my stomach and said, "I'm sleeping.  Why?  What's the matter?".  I woke all the way up and she told me what I had been doing.  I had the vaguest memory of the end of it after she told me.  Strange, huh?  It's never happened in the 10 years since.

i find that if i try anything while someone else is in the bed (even my cats) that i am basically instantly shoved back into my body....naps alone are very successful though.....
<br>
<br>
what about sharing a bed with another who can project??? hmmmmmmm

<section>
hey, Im am in agreement with the others about any contact making obe difficult. When I am sleeping next to my girlfriend, and I wake up to vibrations it is hard to obe because any movement by her causes me to lose my focus and come out of the trance state. I "have" projected while sleeping with my girlfiend, but that was only when the girl I was dating at the time slept pretty much without moving. Any movement always brought me back into my body.

Only bedmate I have is my wife: animals I respect but never wanted to sleep alongside any. I suppose a dog licking your ear every now and again would put a spoke in the works.

<br>
I've had some interesting conversations with my wife within the real-time zone. While sleeping she tends to hover just above her physical body. I'm not sure why but she resists all attempts to come with me to the Astral.
<br>
<br>
I tried to talk to her about it while Physical and she doesn't remember a thing. It's kinda weird because she will acknowledge me leaving and returning as if the process is second nature to her.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
