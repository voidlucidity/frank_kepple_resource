Sorry, I posted this to one forum then realised the forum I was talking about was this one.
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, there was a question about the B.Moen method on this BBS just recently (this forum a few posts below this one) and I happened to notice a chat session was scheduled with the man himself at 9pm ET:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.after-death.com/chat/index.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
<br>
<br>
I'm not exactly sure how ET relates to UK time. But I would recommend for beginners at Astral projection to try and ask a question or two... if your time-zone allows.
<br>
<br>
Reason being, full-blown Astral projection is generally a heck of a tricky thing to accomplish (which Mr Moen accepts). But he developed a method which he calls, "Focussed Attention".
<br>
<br>
This is a method which holds the promise of bringing a person many of the advantages of being able to explore non-physical realms, but with the minimum of hassle-factors (such as those posed by what people call "negs" for example).
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Will it be in a specific chatroom, or  just "#lobby?"

I'm sorry but I'm not sure about that. This one is over but he holds a chat session each month. It's way out of my time zone but I'll try and get more details for the next one.

Hey!  It's the #afterlifeknowledge room.  There is a drop down list.  I went but my damn puter needs an upgrade on the hard drive so every thing was realllllllll slowwwwwwww.  Ended up getting frustrated and left.  I am definitely going back after I upgrade.  Bruce seemed very nice and answered all questions that were put to him.
