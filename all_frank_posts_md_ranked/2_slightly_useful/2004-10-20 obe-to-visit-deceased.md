hello, i am new to these boards, but i always had this thought bothering me.  Have any of you met any deceased family in your OBE's?  If so how did you do it?  Thanks

That depends on several factors.  How long has it been since they passed over?  Did they successfully pass all the way over, or are they bound to the earth plane still.  If they have passed over, they aren't the same 'person' they were on earth.  That person is now a facet of a higher being.

<br>
But the answer you are truly seeking is yes, it's possbile.  My wife meet her grandfather last week, and he passed over 19 years ago.  The message was for her grandmother, whom is still with us.

If you haven't done so already, I'd suggest for you to take a look at Bruce Moen's work by visiting:
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///afterlife-knowledge.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 afterlife-knowledge.com
</a>
. Bruce specialises in this kind of think, and he describes the simple techniques he uses.
<br>
<br>
Bruce has taught many others to do the same thing as he does. I've even had a go myself to good effect. His techniques are so simple, he says the main difficulty people tend to have is believing they are actually doing it. And after having tried it myself I know full well what he means. But what he says does work, no question.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
