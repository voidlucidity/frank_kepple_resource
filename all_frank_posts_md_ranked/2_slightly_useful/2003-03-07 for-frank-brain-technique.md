Dear Frank,
<br>
Thanks for your brain method.  I tried it out last night - I felt like I was falling, then felt a fast type of contraction feeling in my brain and concentrated on it.  It was so powerful it made me twitch a little, but after a while it stopped
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
I got the begginings of the vibrations afterwards, but they faded out.  Could you please give me advice on what I should do once I get the brain contractions, or how I can stop the vibrations from fading?
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
M

It does take a while to become used to the sensations. Feelings of falling or rising upwards at a fairly high speed, tend to cause your protective sense of conscious awareness to keep zapping you out of it. There is no hard and fast answer. Well, none that I know of, let's say. With me it was just a question of practice, practice and yet more practice. Until eventually the whole process became routine.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

I tried this method this morning and got a 'throbbing' sensation in my head, however I started getting it in TWO places, one near the top of my skull and the other somewhere in what felt like the right hemisphere!
<br>
<br>
Which to choose?
<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead I should focus on my brow chakra, as I feel sensations there quite often, even when I'm not involved in doing any energy work. Sometimes when I lie down to go to sleep I can feel it slighlty as I drift off. As it seems that my brow chakra seems to be naturally more activated in my case, do you think I could achieve astral states simply by working with this?
<br>
<br>
Also about focusing on the part of the brain - I was trying to 'feel' what part of my brain triggers vibrations. Is this right or do you actually have to move your entire sense of awareness ie your point of view up there; I would find that difficult, but I don't have much of a problem with concentrating on a certain part part of the brain, if that's what you mean.
<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of firing up the old f27 mp3 soundtrack on my personal stereo again, as this would probably aid this process!

Douglas: you need to play around with the various sensations to the extent where you develop a methodology you feel comfortable with. Which does, of course, take quite a bit of time and dedication to the task in hand. I feel the great thing is you are experiencing something, which gives you stuff to build on. So my answer is basically to experiment with what you are presented with. After all, that's what I find myself doing pretty much the majority of the time.

Yours,

Frank
