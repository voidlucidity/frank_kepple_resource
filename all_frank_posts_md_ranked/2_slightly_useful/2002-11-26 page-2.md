<br>
Once I thanked the Helper for her assistance I was then floating in the blackness, feeling quite peaceful and charged up to do some more exploring. The thought went through me that perhaps I could start creating my second F27 place (my disk-family has been bugging me about this!), and I also wondered about helping in another retrieval. A tall man then appeared ahead and to my left: kinda looked like he was wearing long robes. He radiated such warmth and joy, asking me what I'd like to do. I decided that helping in another retrieval was important and told him this. He said back, "But weren't you thinking of this new place you want to make for yourself?" I said yes but wasn't sure what I wanted.
<br>
<br>
He then started moving his right arm in a wide, counter clockwise circle..and the faster he performed this motion the more it looked as if he was creating a white oval band, like a white rubberband about three feet wide. He stopped and the rubberband disappeared. I just stared at him. He started doing this again and I then started getting some info: it had something to do with being able to create things. He stopped the motion and the band was gone. He started it again and this time the white band became a huge round transparent ball or bubble. He handed it to me and as I gently took it it felt rather weightless. It looked like a huge soap bubble. As soon as I thought that, I saw iridescent colors appear on the bubble's surface, moving and blending together as if in oil. I looked over at him and got nothing back. I'm having trouble remembering all the things I then started thinking about, but what happened was, each time I thought of an object, it would appear inside the bubble, quicker than I could 'mentally think it out'. For instance, when he asked me what kind of a place I wanted to create for myself and I answered I still hadn't decided, but that I was wondering if instead of a place that reflected an earth environment, perhaps a place up in the clouds would be cool?---well beautiful sun splashed billowy clouds appeared in the bubble, in a blink of an eye. I wanted to laugh. Well if I was going to be in the clouds I certainly had to have some kind of structure for the benefit of visiting friends, and so said to him..."how 'bout some kind of deck or---"...and a huge platform/deck appeared in the clouds. He was grinning at me. I was having fun. So I mentally said, "Ocean", and an ocean apppeared before I could even finish formulating the word! I thought of a forest and bingo. I thought of a castle and a big one appeared. I then got silly and did a crystal lined cave, a dog, and I can't remember what else. The faster I thought out a word the faster the image appeared, always a fraction of a nano-second ahead of my finished thought. It was a trip...to watch the images I was apparently creating manifest like this! Probably getting tired of me playing with this, he asked what were the things I really loved...and I thought of trees and yep, what looked like a great oak inside the bubble sat in my hand. As soon as I just recalled the childhood feeling of being up in trees the image changed ...I then had a view from within the tree, sitting high up. Always wanted a house in a tree--and a huge one appeared, complete with large windows and a wrap around porch or deck about thirty feet wide. There must have been 3-4000 square feet of floor space within...a Santa Fe type of fireplace, wooden floors. I didnt like the idea of a square floor plan so made it round. It was then I realized that I was in the scene I had created: I wasn't a bystander...I was in this creation. And with this realization I was then back standing near the guy again, holding the weightless ball with my treehouse within---my new place. He said I could use this whenever I wanted to create anything. I started laughing, feeling wonderful to have this piece of know-how...and I gave him a long look and asked, "Ah c'mon, who are you, really?" He shrugged, smiling, and said, "Just a Helper." I felt such gratitude and love for him, for offering this bubble idea. He knew this instantly and I could feel a loving response. And then he was gone.
<br>
<br>
I had no idea how much time had passed but wasn't in a big hurry to return to C1. As a matter of fact I felt such a warm, soothing peacefulness that I decided to just recline and float. Haven't felt that good in a long time.
<br>
<br>
Love to all,
<br>

Now you are getting like me, in the sense that soon you won't want to come back. I tell you, it makes a big difference having your own place There. Nowadays, I keep myself emotionally closed pretty much all the time but I cannot help feeling a tinge of sadness every now and again when I read people's posts about devils and demons and all kinds of other such (so called) Astral dangers.

 If only these people could become open to what a joyful and harmonious place the Astral can be

. It'd make planet Earth a more harmonious place too I'm sure.

<br>
<br>
The very reason that the world is in the state it is in is
<b>
 because
</b>
people are not aware of these higher realities, including the Astral and Spiritual progression generally.
<br>
<br>
Most people are living in a material world as if they have to make the most of their time here by material means, and which generates the other ugliness such as greed, avarice, fear and hate.
<br>
<br>
Advanced beings in the higher spheres are working hard to turn this situation around, and guide mankind to the true path of progression.
<br>
<br>
If people would realise what a
<b>
 profound
</b>
effect their behaviour in the physical world has on Spiritual progression once they leave the physical world, then the world would indeed be a much more harmonious place. As it is, people only find out these things after they pass on, andthen find themselves having to come back and do it all again, including learning lessons and paying off the karma of the previous life - and so on.
<br>
<br>
Knowledge of the Astral reality is a key to this, as is this very site.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your excellent contributions.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

Adrian.

Hi everyone,Frank, Just felt the urge to write this to you , the urge was strong so I could not ignore it any Longer,I do not know if you have read any of my posts,I have been posting for about a week now maybe Less,if you have read them ,then you will know that I WAS one of the described people who you referred to as "Living in the material world"------ to a certain degree anyway------------But now since regaining the abillity to Astral fly-------at this much maturer age than I was before and after a 12 year absence,I have discovered something more than blizz, more than,well anything I can put into words.
<br>
Just wanted you to know that the fear has almost nearly dissapeared 100% and I understand your words of Astral Wisdom.
<br>
Also Just to let you know that there are some people out there who Educate themselves without having the strengh to let their Educator know his sweet success.
<br>
A quick re-cap for you--------I began having un-controlled Out Of Body Experiences as I entered puburty-------------
<br>
I was a natural Astral flyer but did not know--------felt very scared--------This went on for a Long time------------------------------
<br>
I fought the experience off untill I could no longer project------------------
<br>
then 12 years later here I am at the age of 31 years--------------------A little more educated on the matter of Astral Flying------------Alot less feared,maybe even 99% fearless-----------------and now a happy Natural flyer who is almost always in a state of calm blizz over a Re-discovery of a natural Gift from nature--------------------ThankS------------Helen

Genni,
<br>
<br>
What a completely wondeful adventure, thank you so much for sharing.  I felt like I was wrapped up in a soft ,warm blanket when I read your post.
<br>
<br>
What a great comfort we have knowing there are such loving helpers out there.  Helpers who are there in the astral all the time and the helpers who go there to have a visit.  I look forward to reading your next experience with warm and kind feelings!
<br>
<br>
Best Wishes,
<br>

Tracy

Hi Frank,
<br>
<br>
Got a brief, true story to share with you about fear and how **fear-based beliefs** can create such unnecassary suffering.
<br>
<br>
A friend of mine bolted straight up in bed one night, out of what she  assumed  to be a nightmare, or worse. 'Something' in her dream had been clawing at her face. Upon awakening her religious beliefs naturally interpreted the dream experience as 'something' trying to harm her...something 'evil'.
<br>
<br>
While working on her first cup of coffee and after calming down, she told me she then began to realize that perhaps the 'something' in her dream hadn't actually been clawing at her...that there was a feeling almost hidden underneath all the fear, a feeling that said someone had been trying to say something that she should need not  be afraid of.  And she had a feeling her favorite aunt had been in the dream. Well this really confused her....until the phone rang, around an hour after her dream. It was her mother calling to tell her her aunt had passed away...and it just so happend her aunt had made her final exit at the time my friend was having her dream experience. It hit my friend  like a sledgehammer. Her aunt had always greeted her neices, nephews and grandchildren by placing both hands on their cheeks and giving each an gentle squeeze. Because of my friend's religious beliefs at the time of the dream, she had interpreted her aunt's habit of showing affection--in her final farewell to her--as a 'demon clawing her face'! And it then came to my friend that her aunt had indeed been talking to her in the dream about leaving...and that she loved her.
<br>
<br>
What was interesting too was this seemed to help my friend begin to question her fears: fear of death; fear of anything nonphysical; ...to ask where they came from.
<br>
<br>
How many times have so many been confronted with some lost soul who just needed directions or a little company...and we instantly assumed they were evil?
<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work, Frank...cause to me you and Adrian are a big part of that  light at the end of the tunnel.
<br>
<br>
Much love,
<br>
<br>
Gin
<br>

Hi Tracy,
<br>
<br>
You are just so kind! Thank you. It makes me feel good to know I can share and learn with so many great folks.
<br>
<br>
Hey Tracy---Helpers have a wonderful sense of humor too. After all, they well remember being human and all the funny things associated with it. In the beginning of retrieving I was such a knucklehead at times...and honestly, there were moments when Helpers wouldn't respond to a strange question or reaction of mine for a good minute or two....because they were laughing, or trying in vain to hide their mirth for my sake. They are absolutely wonderful to work with, learn from...and just have a jolly time with now and then.
<br>
<br>
Exploring the afterlife is a total gas!----:O)

Much love,
<br>

I think it stems from experiences within Physical reality. Within the Astral I have an open mind. I suppose because I know that absolutely nothing can harm me. But on the Physical?
