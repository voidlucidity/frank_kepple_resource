This morning I had another OBE experience and similar to some of my past OBE's recently I was fascinated to just hang out in the area between the physical and the astral for a while before fully leaving my body.  One of the things that happens to me on a consistent basis is that as i phase into the OBE environment I go through a state or tuning in which I actually hear the radio playing music, although my physical radio is not on.  This morning was no different except I decided to go into the state, out of it again, and then back into it several times to make sure my radio indeed was not on.  Everytime I came out of it and openened my physical eyes there was no sound of a radio... then i would close my eyes and let myself phase back into the astral and there would be the radio again in full stereo.  I layed there and listened to it for at least 20 or 30 minutes just to see if it would continue.  Sure enough after one song completed another song started.  They were tunes I had heard before but did not listen to very frequently.  Indeed I make a point of NOT listening to the radio very much at all.  So I found it fascinating to tune into this on the astral... a continuous stream of music programming song after song and even advertising, announcements, etc.  So, either I was indeed listening to an actual radio station or somehow in that state my mind was replaying a radio station I had heard in the past with 100% perfect recall and audio clarity.  Either way it's very fascinating.  It would sure beat MP3's and CD's if we could recall music with such clarity and precision at will.  Anyway, just thought I would share.

Suddenly I find myself reminded of Donald DeGracia. I think he said that all astral locations were tuned into like radio stations.

As strange as it may seem, hearing music within the Astral is very normal. I went through a phase of drifting in the 3D-Blackness listening to my favourite pieces. Stopped doing it though as it was getting a bit addictive, and floating around listening to music isn't exactly productive.

I know what you mean about coming back to Physical to check. When it first happened to me I distinctly remember getting out of bed and going through the rooms of the house checking that a radio or TV hadn't been left on!
<br>
<br>
Also, people often ask me what the Astral planes are like. The answer is, once you can get beyond all the emotional pitfalls of the lower regions, the upper Astral (if that's the right term) is very much like being on the Physical without all the negative stuff such as death, wars, famine, earthquakes and the like. Plus, everyone is friendly and tend to be engaged in all manner of positive pursuits, including composing music.
<br>
<br>
You might also find the music you are hearing is being channeled by a guide as a means of contact.

Thanks for the input Frank.  Nice to know this happens to someone else as well.  I've been having OBE's now for several years and have already made contact with my guides and tour the other planes of the astral on a fairly regular basis.  The fact is that normal "real-time zone" out of body experiences are usually pretty boring to me, so when I find myself there of late, I find myself just sort of meandering around experimenting with little things to sort of try and figure out the properties of the different levels in between where I've gone.  It's sort of like when I was a kid and I would be bored in the house on a summer day so I would go lay down in the grass in the back yard and spend hours just focussing in on all the bugs, insects, worms, etc that were living and thriving in the grass.  I would just stare at it and become amazed at all the life forms living in that one patch of grass or moss etc.  The same thing tends to happen in the real time zone now.  On that same excursion I mentioned above, after I got bored listening to the music, I decided to go outside.  I found a patch of grass and decided to shrink myself down and just try and see the grass and earth at as microscopic a level as I could.  It was fascinating.  I've done the same thing with the ceiling of my room or the texture of a piece of wood.  I know it all sounds very boring but for some reason I'm so very intrigued when it's happening.  I feel like we go exploring so far out that we sometimes miss the opportunities to explore that exist right here in front of us.

I used to hear music in my near sleep too. Here I am, in my paralysis state and hearing the most beautiful piece of music that I never heard before in the darkness of the night. Of course at that time I don't know what the heck are happening. I feel that I can compose the most beautiful music only that I know nothing about music.
<br>
<br>
It doesn't occur much now but it sure beats most of the music on the radio station.

there are article about receiving radio waves when projecting. It's about something relating to receiving radio broadcast on the astral complete with ad, commentaries etc.

Same thing happened to me yesterday.
<br>
I've heard music before but have always just blocked it off as a distraction.  Yesterday I had just positioned myself in the 3D space place and this piece of Classical music started playing.  I just chilled with it... and then became very curious.  I could hear all the seperate instruments, parts to the music I'd forgotten (I haven't heard the piece for years) and it went on for ages.
<br>
<br>
I've read before that you could tune into Radio Astral Grooves

so I just chilled with it.

this has happened to me before too, during both dreams and astral projections. I've heard some of the most amazingly beautiful pieces of music, far beyond what i've heard before or what i could imagine. I've also read whole books that were amazingly good...

I tell you the depth of all this seems infinite.  I truly wish for a day when I could be part of projects to explore these areas and states more scientifically and in controlled environments and parameters.  Should good fortune come to me (and I be independantly weathly) I'd like to do that... or set up my own institute.

Well, I think i'm getting closer to a conclusion that the radio music i hear while in the meditive state is indeed a real radio station or several.  This morning I hung out in that between state and listened to about a half hour of country music and commercials.  Now, I don't listen to country music and I don't know or haven't heard any of the modern country music songs which is what it sounded like.  I know a couple old country tunes but didn't hear any of those during this experience.  Thus, I think I am proving conclusively that we have the ability to perceive radio signals while in the hypnogogic state.  This is really interesting.  Think about what that might mean.  The possibility that you could literally listen in on any radio signal if you knew how to tune or dial up or down so to speak.
