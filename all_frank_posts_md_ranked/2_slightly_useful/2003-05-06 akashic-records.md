WHY ARENT THERE MORE LOTTERY WINNERS IF ONE CAN ACCESS PRETTY MUCH ANY INFORMATION IN THE ASTRAL LIBRARIES? I WOULD THINK THAT GIVING YOURSELF THIS INFORMATION WOULD ENABLE YOU TO SET UP YOUR LIFESTYLE TO RELAX FROM LIFES MATERIALISTIC WORRIES AND ALLOW YOU TO PERSUE THE MORE ENLIGHTENING WAYS OF LIFE.
<br>
<br>
<br>
INPUT ANYONE?

Actually, most people don't like capital letters.
<br>
<br>
Besides, the future isn't set in stone. The past and present merely create a multitude of possibilities. You might be able to see a possible future, but it would be dependent on certain factors, which might change.
<br>
<br>
Also, people don't reply to topics that don't interest them.

bring about more time for enlightenment?

i guess it is contradictary but i find that free time is one of the hardest things for me to achieve. i have three kids and my wife works nights so i am
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///mr.mom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 mr.mom
</a>
and i dont get much time to myself. i cant find time to dedicate to meditation or working on my energy balances to achieve an astral travel. the only time i get to work on these things is on my lunch hour. and as you can tell, that isnt much time at all. i am not whining, i just am very excited about this obe thing and am very anxious to achieve my first one.
<br>
<br>
<br>
also, i am going to play devils advocate here and ask why is it wrong to get the winning lottery numbers to better yourself?
<br>
<br>
if you had forewarning about impending personal or close family disaster, wouldnt you use the information from the akashic records to "better" yourself and do whatever you could to avoid said disaster?

You can try to get the lottery numbers, but the best I have heard of is being within + or - 5 or so on all the numbers without exact matches. Still, I have never read a good reason for this.

<section>
It could be a paradox in a way. Let's say you're looking at what the winning numbers are and thats in the future.  Let's say you're not the person who is most likely in the future to win.  Couldnt you then think that the winning numbers will change.  How do you know the future of who is going to become rich isn't more set than the lottery numbers themself into the future?
<br>
<br>
Another thing is its not the definite future.  In everything I've read people have said It's whats most likely to happen based on the past.

Having never projected (well... yet) I can only give a theory.  The way I have heard it explained, the Record contains info on everything that will ever or has ever happened.  Supposing for a minute that multiple "dimensional" theories are correct where every possibility exists in some parallel universe... then perhaps the Record holds so many possible future lottery numbers for different realities that it makes it hard to find the set of numbers you need.  Lot of info to sift through.  I  could be WAY off on that though.
<br>
<br>
Or perhaps the information is recalled incorrectly due to the mind split... ?

Never mind the lottery. Try a stock market, where you could make some serious money by learning which companies are going to improve and which are covering up billions of dollars of debts. Or, if you want a challenge of a different sort, try a casino.

You can douse the winning lotto numbers with crystals, however dont bother trying it, you can only do it if you have PURE intent and you will use the money to better mankind - but money as much as that from the lotto can corrupt the strongest of individuals.

So you are saying that I can get the lottery numbers in time to buy a ticket with them, but only if my intent is pure enough? That if I fail to succeed in getting the correct lottery numbers it is because something is wrong with me? Worse, that you think there is something wrong with almost everyone?

<section>
Tom, i like your idea of the stock market, it porbably would pan out better.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hephaestus, the records sound like a neutral place just recording events, i cant see how your intent has anything to do with your access. i could get info that shows me the murderer of my kids and use that to get revenge on him, and this would be a "balancing" event according to karmic laws, but that would not negate the fact that i just did something bad.(I hope people realise my kids arent dead, this was just hypothetical.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Themadness, why is it wrong to have personal gain out of something like this? who is to say i wouldnt do something grandois with the money?  I do happen to agree with whoever said that much money probably would corrupt me, but it is an interesting thought to think of all the good i could do with it. Like this website for example. this wonderful forum is brought to us without one cent out of our pockets and i think that it is one of the greatest sources of info for all my weird questions about my new views on life. With all that money i could start something like this.
<br>
<br>
sure i could spend the money on me and mine, but i like to think i have also matured enough to see that the money would never bring me true happiness.
<br>
<br>
I also happen to think that people that play the lottery are fools and the winners of the lottery are actually more cursed than blessed.

pure intent means to spend the whole lottory money not on yourself but entirely on others to help them - nobody who wins the lottory is going to spend it all on others - anybody who thinks otherwise is being unbelievbly naive. You may come to an astral forum wishing to be an enlightened soul and all that but no matter how far a person reaches/advances they would never after winning the lotto spend the entire several million of it on benefitting others.
<br>
This mean you cant keep a few hundred thousands away for yourself by the way. This is the real world where we are held within a physical body, a physical body with a physical mind and human emotions, no matter how you may feel you have progressed in the end whilst you're on this planet you'll be tempted by material gain. you can continue to think people are pure enough to be trusted with winning the lotto and spending it all on the betterment of mankind but rest assured thats not the case and never will be on this plane of existance.
<br>
<br>
So are you going to tell me if you won several million on the lotto you would spend the whole lot on others helping them? because thats not whats going to happen and you know it.
<br>
<br>
The odds of the lotto dictate that people are gunna win the jackpot, thats their luck, they can do what they want with that money because THEY won it by them selves, they wernt told the numbers - but if you're going to douse for it its a different matter, the higher powers are gunna tell you the winning numbers, you're not the one working them out, thats them putting their trust in you to spend it all on the betterment of mankind - they know better than that, the intent may be good when the douseing begins but once that moneys in the person bank account things arnt going to go to plan.
<br>
<br>
There is no disrespect meant to anyone as what im refering to is 'human nature' - now if want to debate that everyone isnt bound by their human nature please go right ahead.

I have heard many accounts of the akashik records, and one thing I have heard is that its so vast and complex that its too much for the human mind to handle. However, I dont think there is anything wrong with using extra-sensory powers for material gains, but there is a possibility for corruption.

<br>
The simple reason why is because it's just not that easy!
<br>
<br>
The question is very easy to say and sounds logical to ask, but it's one heck of a thing to actually try and do. Plus, the "future" is not some concrete thing which can be read from a book someplace. It is the product of an endless mix of probable events.
<br>

<section>
I agree with Frank.
<br>
<br>
And, also, speaking from experience . . . I find that this otherworldly business of OBEs, Akashic records, and other psychic "stuff" has a kind of natural protective barrier around it - - - materialists and/or fortunehunters tend not to be able to "get in" to do their moneymaking.
<br>
<br>
First, the very nature of psychic development leads to the lessening of materialistic urges.  That's why most mystics are poor, and why most rich ones are fake.
<br>
<br>
Second, people who want to get rich quick tend not to want to work at anything for too long, or save money over a long period of time.  These people tend to fail at OBE or anything else requiring discipline and patience.
<br>
<br>
Basically, if you can keep up your meditative/spiritual practices to the extent where you can control your mind and leave your body often enough to do anything of any psychic significance, once you "get there," money will be the last thing on your mind.  And what IS on your mind is where you will "go."  At that point, once you get beyond the "WHEE! Watch me walk through this wall!" what you will REALLY be interested in are . . . people you love, stuff you see, people you meet, or yearnings about What It All Means.
<br>
<br>
So guys/gals, the Answer is pretty boring:  modesty and thrift, patience and work.  Psychic development, well controlled over a long period of time may lead you to a lifetime of better life choices, which might keep you out of the poorhouse.  But it won't cause you to get rich quick.
<br>
<br>
Then again, if any of you become so adept at reading the Akashic records that you can glean something reliable and significant from that floating alphabet soup, write me a poem, because I'm dying to know What it All Means . . .

Hi, all.  Winning the lottery sounds like fun.  But I don't think the numbers are in the Akashic Records.
<br>
<br>
In my "travels", it seems to be a big library of sorts with so much in it that it would take lifetimes just to read a portion.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my sense of it is that it has your "soul records" (among other things) wherein you can learn where you have been and what you expected to accomplish in the here and now.  I don't know that it has future events, perhaps probable or likely ones that you might get involved in and choices you might make.  It is really difficult to make sense of as I think it does have what might be called turning points in your life - times of extreme importance to your soul's purpose and intent in this life.
<br>
<br>
I am sure there are gifted people who can read them on a regular, intentional basis.  The problem is there are so many charlatans in that business, it is hard to tell who really can.  You can certainly go there astrally, but I did not see my own records.  Wish I had.
<br>
Perhaps if I find my self there again, I might make some progress in that area.
<br>
<br>
I also perceived that it had generational records - the events that affected everyone at a given time.  Now that might be real interesting reading, to see what really happened in history or to see the turning points for this coming decade.
<br>
<br>
If anyone else has visited the records, what did you see or sense of it while you were there?

<section>
Sorry about coming off offensive in my post. I didn't intend the question to have that edge to it. My bad.
<br>
<br>
I should rephrase my question to an answer. I think the biggest obstacle in accessing the akashic records to win the lottery would be intent. I suppose in your case, your intent is pure - to help the family. But I won't judge. Let me put it another way. I believe in karma: and pure intentions reap pure rewards.
<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I remember a Buddhist teacher talking once of how only people who
<i>
 deserve
</i>
to win the lottery win it.
