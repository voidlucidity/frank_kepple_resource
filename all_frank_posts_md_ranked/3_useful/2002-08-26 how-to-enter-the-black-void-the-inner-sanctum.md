<section>
I noticed some people on the board describing the black void areas that they sometimes find themselves and what they are.
<br>
<br>
I think of the void as a kind of 'buffer zone' between the astral and your own mind.
<br>
I have not actually visited this 'mind void' but I know a friend of mine who has.
<br>
She learned the technique from a book on witchcraft.
<br>
You can use this technique to reprogram cirmumstances in the physical world to your adavantage.
<br>
<br>
The technique:
<br>
1) Do your usual meditation/energy raising techniques (if you feel that you need them).
<br>
<br>
2) visualise a large glowing pentagram, (the pentagram is popular in magical disiplines for it ability to raise energy and other facters when meditated on).
<br>
<br>
3) now, imagine a door in the centre of the pentagram. Concentrate on this.
<br>
Now mentally open this door.
<br>
<br>
4) when you open the door you should imagine an area of very bright white light on the other side of the doorway *with a small circle of darkness in the middle, a small disk of black at the exact centre of the white light*.
<br>
<br>
4) Now concentrate on the black circle, will yourself to begin moving towards it.
<br>
After a while you will begin to feel the pull and you will be drawn into the circle, you will see it getting closer and closer, bigger and bigger as you move into it and feel it absorbing your conciousness.
<br>
<br>
5) You will now find yourself in the famous 'black void' which practitioners refer to as the 'inner sanctum of the mind' which I like to think of as a kind of 'buffer zone' between the astral and your own mind.
<br>
<br>
It should feel very comfortable in this black void, you can just let yourself float around in the blackness.
<br>
Turn around slowly, you will see the circle from which you just entered.
<br>
You will see your body lying there on the other side of the circle!
<br>
<br>
6) Â Now, once you feel that you have spent long enough in the pleasant enviroment of the void you could just will yourself to retun to your body, however, if you want to try the technique for influencing the material world try this:
<br>
<br>
Simply say to yourself while you are in the void (or think it aloud), 'I am in the inner sanctum of my mind, I will that when I return, my personal cirmumstances and personal forntune will change for the better, luck and good fortune/opportunity will come at me from every direction, wealth and happiness will come into my life'
<br>
(you get the idea - be sincere about it though, *believe* in what you are saying)
<br>
<br>
Return to your body.
<br>
You will begin to notice major changes in your life after this, it is like giving your own personal fortune an injection, luck, money and opportunity should start hitting you from all directions, this does not last for ever but gives you a *massive boost* in personal fortune for a short time.
<br>
My friend found that this worked but only used it twice as it had such a powerful effect. She last used it before starting on a new business plan that she was working on. Her business flourishing now!
<br>
<br>
Try this out for yourselves and let me know what you make of it, you may not wish to try the 'reprogramming' technique but I don't see the problem with giving it a go, if it doesnt work for you you wont have lost anything.
<br>
<br>
I will certainly try this once my AP technique has been perfected some more.
<br>
<br>
Let me know how you get on if you decide to try it, by all accounts the Inner sanctum or 'mind void' can be utilised to great effect in the material world!
<br>

The black void effect comes about by mentally stepping into the Astral with the intention of stepping into a black void (on the Astral, as you think so it becomes). Like you say, you end up in what feels like a kind of buffer zone between the Astral and ordinary consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Here you can just allow yourself to drift in complete nothingness. Which is quite relaxing. Though I think if it were to happen to someone by chance, and they didn't know anything about the Astral, or anything, then it could be quite scary.
<br>
<br>
You can also drift to the music (Astrally generated, I mean) of your choice. Which is a lovely sensation, as you actually feel the music as well as hear it. Which also happens on the Physical, to an extent, but it's a thousand times better on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
There are other things you can do while in this state, like, contact guides and so forth. Also, affirmations made on the Astral can have some profound Physical effects.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

 <br>
 Well, the black void area/state seems particularily good for this, according to those who use it. It seems that (as all good magicians already know), with skill it is possible to radically alter physical circumstances.
 <br>
 <br>
 There's one old occult proverb I heard somewhere that says
 <br>
 'The fool allows himself to be ruled by his stars but the wise man rules himself'.

I had actually equated the black viod as being something bad. The couple of times I had clearly recalled it in the past was just after I'd had something of an argument with my wife before going to sleep. Since then I have been able to slip into this void after a peroid of meditation, but all was good, so that blew away the "bad" theory. I guess the times I'd experienced it in the past were when my body was very relaxed (as you would be falling asleep), but my mind was still in top gear.
<br>
<br>
I find in this place I have the strangest sense as if I'm still kind of in my body, but my awareness is drifting, but in several directions at once, like I'm expanding or contracting. There is also a sense that the void is infinite.

I found myself in the void more than a few times. the first couple of times
<br>
I thought I had projected and didn't have my vision yet. But I can reach out,
<br>
and kick my legs and never feel a wall or furniture as I can when projected.
<br>
<br>
It then hit me that this was different, a type of inner point of consciousness,
<br>
deeply set inside the brain. this must be why I felt so safe in all that
<br>
blackness, like I was inside myself.
<br>
<br>
I would get there by telling myself before going to sleep," when my body
<br>
falls asleep my conscious will awake and I will be aware of it."
<br>
<br>
....Just my two cents...

Well, if you want a fairly reliable way of going there then give the technique I described a go.
<br>
It works quite well I think, as I am still not a very good APer but even I started to feel the pull and the sensation of being drawn into the black circle, I stopped then as this time I was only testing out the technique, it works!
