<section>
Over the last week I have been looking for guides. I have had a new experience as a result and I am unsure how to proceed on this one. First of all --- I know there is a significant amount of emphasis on this forum regarding the darker side of mysticism. I don't personally buy into that because I believe my very real-seeming demons have all turned out to be figments when I confronted them. So feel free to offer input about negative entities, just know where I currently stand.  I'm open to the concept but doubtful.
<br>
<br>
Here's the experience. A few days ago, when asking about a guide (actually I asked whether a real-life friend whom I consider to be a somewhat advanced soul could act as my guide) I had the sense that there was a guide within me. It is a strange sensation. Sort of how one might imagine being body-snatched, but not at all threatening and rather comforting in a 'we're in this together' sort of way.
<br>
<br>
So I don't know quite what to make of this. I had the same response the next two times I placed the question. I wonder if the message is that the guidance I need is within myself, or if the message is that guides can take many forms, or if the message is that less-than-complete trust is a hurdle that I should try to overcome ( it would require some large degree of trust to really turn the driving over to someone else.)
<br>
<br>
I don't know that the experience will go anywhere - but it is a persistent sense. II am tempted to turn the driving over and see where it leads. The sense of companionship runs entirely through my body, it is not localized in any location. I suppose if anyone had had similar experiences, it might make my decision easier.
<br>
<br>
Anyone?

<section>
Touring the Astral with a guide is generally *much* more productive and I, for one, would highly recommend you to delve deeper in this area.
<i>
 You will learn far more if you turn over the driving, as you call it, to them
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
I found that guides approach you very gradually, at first, so as not to alarm you.
<br>
<br>
With me, I get a feeling like if I were on the physical and I sensed someone behind me. They will only approach you full-on when they are sure you are ready. Meeting a guide can often be a very emotive experience, and I don't know why that is exactly.
<br>
<br>
I assume it is something to do with the energy they radiate. You get a very humble feeling and it makes you want to stand in awe. Well, that's what used to happen to me. Whether you will feel the same I don't know, but I think it would pay you to be aware of the possibility. Because, if you let that kind of emotion overwhelm you, a buffer experience will come about wherein you might find yourself bowing down to angels, and the like.
<br>
<br>
I have what I call a "regular" who I nicknamed Harry. He takes me on tours of the belief-system areas and shows me some of the more interesting cases. Harry also has this flying craft that we travel in now and again. Last time we went in it, he flew through an Astral-Plane Entrance Structure which was a lovely experience as I had never seen one before.
<br>
<br>
Afterwards I realised why not: I always keep my "eyes" closed while moving around at speed. Something which I am still trying to get out of the habit of doing. I think it was no coincidence that I realised this after the trip, as I reckon Harry put the seed-thought in my mind.
<br>
<br>
Guides will scan your thoughts and communicate directly from mind to mind. That is probably where you are getting the feeling of "companionship" from. However, your guide will only come as close as you are ready to receive them, as they are only too aware of your own emotional strengths and weaknesses.
<br>
<br>
Also, don't be surprised if you get a strong feeling you met your guide before somewhere. That's how I feel about Harry. I would swear blind I met the guy before but cannot, for the life of me, think where. And don't be surprised if you find guides introducing you to people that seem to already know you. This used to confuse the heck out of me, at first. Like, these people knew my name and all about me, as if they were lifelong, close friends. Yet, I'd never seen them before???
<br>
<br>
Problem is, they all communicate non-verbally and can scan your mind. Which does take a *lot* of getting used to. Plus, you slowly start to begin to be able to do the same. But it takes a while to learn. In the beginning stages you only pick up little snippets about the person (the stage I am currently at) which gives you a, "Haven't I seen you before somewhere?" sensation.
<br>
<br>
Guides are excellent for helping you to "trace your roots" which is what I am currently working on.
<i>
 However, you need to be prepared for some pretty explosive emotive experiences that you will find impossible to remain closed to
</i>
. Your guide will generally not interfere with this, in the sense of protecting you from the experience, as it is your actual experiencing of the situation that is part and parcel of your mind's enlightenment process.
<br>
<br>
To my mind, finally getting around to seeking a guide is a major turning point. First the temptation is to look at the Astral as a huge adventure playground. Which is nice, and is a view I held for quite a number of years. But I believe the first step on your own path of enlightement is when you finally summon the courage to ask a guide to show you the way.
<br>
<br>
That's basically the point where you stop playing and begin to discover all of what "life" is really about. And it can be one heck of a rocky road.
<br>
<br>
Where you state, "but  I don't personally buy into that because I believe my very real-seeming demons have all turned out to be figments when I confronted them." I hope you absolutely believe that statement utterly and totally, 100%. As it will be tested time and again (especially at first).
<br>
<br>
Best of luck.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Thanks Frank,
<br>
<br>
Your experience strengthens my resolve to pursue this possible contact a little more deeply.
<br>
<br>
Care to share some of your more frightening experiences? You imply that the idea of negative perceptions is tested ---- I am curious --
<br>
<br>
My own personal experiences with negative dark 'beings' followed close deaths; and I was certain that these very palpable 'beings' were there to kill me.  One was the spitting image of the cloaked grim reaper. Others looked more like gremlins. My decisions to confront them had a lot to do with not knowing how else to  deal with the situation - I really had nowhere to run since they were plaguing me round the clock.  they more or less dissolved when I turned and said "Go ahead, give it your best shot."
<br>
<br>
But I can imagine more tenacious gremlins, so perhaps there is more in store -
<br>

<section>
Thank you for the opportunity to share, but it does not pay to dwell on what are commonly called: negative experiences. I find it has the effect of magnifying their importance. Such that, when on the Astral, they can unexpectedly manifest and spoil the experience.
<br>
<br>
You say these creatures you perceived "followed close deaths". It would appear, to me, that you had some kind of cognitive awareness about these up and coming deaths (which is only natural, as you say, these people were close to you). However, rather than recognising the incoming thoughts directly, for what they were, you reacted emotionally to them. Thus created a distorted picture of the reality of the situation.
<br>
<br>
With guides, on the Astral, it's not so much that your negative perceptions are tested, like, as if you were sitting an exam. It's just that you set off down a road to find out who You really are. In doing so, you become *highly* exposed to the magical and previously unimaginable Truth of Life. Which, many times, will cause you to experience an overwhelming emotional mix that you will find *impossible* to control (at the time).
<br>
<br>
Accept the fact that the chances of you veering off on an emotional tangent, positive or negative (to quote popular terms), is very likely. These can often result in forced awakenings back to the Physical. However, If you can keep your act together, and think your way through things, rationally and unemotionally, you will survive: thus keep treading the true path back to your source. Rather than, as I say, veering off on an emotional tangent.
<br>
<br>
The good news is, if you are with a guide, they will not let you experience more than they know you can bear. Which means you can go ahead and experience whatever it is, fully in the knowledge that (however confusing it may appear at the time) you will be able to work through it eventually.
<br>
<br>
As an example: I posted a short while ago about my experience of being taken to a garden with children playing, all around. Some where lying sleeping in the shade of the trees who had been badly traumatised as a result of what they had experienced on the Physical. Eventually, they would awaken and learn how to play again. What I didn't say, in my original post, is that one of those children, was me.
<br>
<br>
Realisation of this caused an instant and uncontrollable burst of emotion that is still within me even now. I can feel it, as I type, welling up at the sides of my head wanting to explode outwards into floods of tears. Quite why, I do not know. All I do know is I that need to keep working on solving the mystery in a rational, logical manner, and I will find the answer (eventually) of who I really am.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
When I was a child . . . I used to believe that my older Self was looking after me.  For instance, I would be nine, and me at age 30 would come to me in my dreams and give me advice.
<br>
<br>
Eventually I forgot all about it . . . until now . . . and when I read Monroe's Ultimate Journey I had such an emotional response to his own realization that the more evolved Robert was helping the less evolved Robert, with different ages/stages of Roberts going back and forth in time and involving himself/themselvesin his/their own life(s) and spiritual development.  Pretty awesome!  The "higher self" exists . . . higher selves, actually.
<br>
<br>
So . . . that contact that feels as if it is coming from inside of you . . . might actually BE you . . . or it might not . . . but the chance that it MIGHT be you might cause you to relax and feel confident that you are turning over the reigns to a much more capable You than you are at this point in time.  And who more than YOU knows YOU, and what you need to see/experience to develop yourself?  Who has more of an interest in developing you spiritually than YOURSELF?
<br>
<br>
Then again, the answer might lie elsewhere.  I am just throwing out ideas!

OOOOH!
<br>
<br>
I like that, Tisha. I had forgotten that bit of guidance that Robert had gotten. I have done the same exercise that you mention, too - and no doubt will contiue to be interested in helping my younger self as I age.
<br>
<br>
You know, Monroe has been such an instrumental part of my explorations into consciousness. I never physically met him, but I owe him a debt of gratitude that is simply huge. At one point early on, I voiced to him (RAM) that I could use help. And darned if I didn't immediately hear a male voice say  "I'll do what I can from my end."  Sure enough, more adventures followed (though I have forgotten the sequence at this point.) .
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the thought -
