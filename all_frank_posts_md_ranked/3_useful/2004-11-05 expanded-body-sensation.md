Hopefully a simple question:
<br>
<br>
A few times, when meditating, I've entered a state where my body feels immensely swollen and expanded. I feel VERY heavy, and it seems a very familiar sensation, even tho I don't remember having ever experienced it before.
<br>
<br>
I have no difficulty at all in moving.Mentally, I feel completely awake and alert.
<br>
<br>
So, the question: What state IS this?

It is typical of the kinds of expansion feelings you can get in this kind of state; where you are not fully focused within the non-physical, but you are not entirely focussed within the physical either. While physical, the energy of your consciousness fills the body, so to speak, which is a finite space. So we get used to the feeling of that particular space and never really notice it â€“ until it changes.
<br>
<br>
Once we pull away from the finite limitations of the physical, we often feel a sense of expansion. But because you are still focused
<i>
 to a degree
</i>
within the physical, the sense of consciousness expansion you are feeling still has a physical-body association. In other words, you are relating the sense of consciousness-expansion to your physical body. So it feels like your physical body expanded. The heaviness you feel is a typical sensation you can get when your sense of consciousness is awake and alert, but your physical body is very relaxed.
