<section>
hello  from Rodentmouse
<img alt=":D" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/cheesy.png" title="Cheesy"/>
<br>
<br>
about the rope tecnique first, i was climbing it yesterday in a trance, and i did it for about a minuite solid,   i want to know should this be long enough, or d you have to be climbing it for longer?   if so, how long? ( I  KNOW my first projection is imminent..., this seems to be my only obstacle to get over now)
<br>
<br>
Also, this may have been my imagination or my higher self, but whilst in a trance with energy surging through my body with all chakras active,  out of the middle of nowhere came a clear voice in my head...i think she said something like "try harder"  or "almost there"   at this moment i saw with my minds eye a women with long brown hair,   could anyone clarify this experience??
<br>
it didnt seem like imagination at the time becasue no train of thoughts could have led to a random outburst, on the other hand, my imagination may have conjured it up because of my determination and obsession with OBE and the fact that i fully beleive a higher self exists.....

I think the best answer to your question might be to realise what part the rope-trick is actually playing in the general scheme of things. First, the act of actually projecting within the Astral is a natural bodily reflex. Basically, you place yourself in a particular state which activates this reflex.
<br>
<br>
The way the reflex is activated is by placing your focal point of awareness at the top of your head. Which is all you really need to do. So the question arises, "How do I get my focal point of awareness to the top of my head?" one effective answer to that question is: by using a little meta-physical imagery to kick-start the upward transition. And that is the part the rope-trick plays.
<br>
<br>
However, there is a major pit-fall, which is: if you begin to concentrate on actually climbing the rope, and visualise the process in too much detail, then what you start to become involved in is an act of Creative Visualisation. Which, of course, is not Astral Projection. In other words, your focal point of awareness becomes the act of climbing the rope. Which means it will remain stuck usually at a point behind your physical eyes.
<br>
<br>
In your case, I feel you don't need the rope-trick at all. I also feel, considering the point at which you are at in the projection process, it may well be scuppering your projection attempts. I very much doubt the voice you heard was your imagination. Plus, if you are absolutely sure you saw the figure in your minds eye, then you should definitely not be doing any kind of rope-trick at that point.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

Frank  i  have sometimes  got to the stage when my focal point of awareness is in my head, are you suggesting i just wait until i project??
<br>
when i do the rope trick, i can feel  the vibrations become more intense- but you are suggesting this is the wrong approach???    and even if i saw the image in my head,  nevertheless, i am still in my body.
<br>
<br>
Im also troubled by the way i cant seem to maintain the buzzing  sound in my head,  whenever it comes on  i cant help  trying to "listen" to it with my ears and thusly it goes away,  and because of this  i cant help but think im not going with the flow and that im thinking about it to much,   i hope i will get used to it with practise.

That final transition, between being vaguely aware of the physical and stepping into the Astral, can be a *very* tricky mental balancing act. So please be aware that the problems you are experiencing are very normal.
<br>
<br>
You see, any kind of thoughts about the physical, any slight fears, or nervousness, or even "trying" too hard or "thinking" too much can scupper the process at that point.
<br>
<br>
What I would do, as you have said you can get your focal point of awareness to the top of your head, and you mentioned about how you saw the woman in your mind's eye, I would work on sending your focal point of awareness forwards in order to activate what is generally called the 3rd eye (or what you are calling your mind's eye).
<br>
<br>
You should at first begin seeing stray energy, following which an image of the Astral should come into view. You will find that you can mentally "step into" this image whereupon you find yourself within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Best of luck,
<br>
Frank

by becoming  my focal point of awareness, would concentrating on my 3rd eye/ brow chakra work as a "path"  or tecnique, as in something i can follow to become it, usually its chance weather it happens or not,   but id rather concentrate on the heart, because i read somewhere that its the heart chakra which is primarily for OBE and brow chakra for  psychic abilities.  Sometimes the pain can get quite intense when my 3rd eye/ brow chakra is fully stimulated.
<br>
About forgeting the physical,  this  is interesting, i usually keep in mind the physical room....
