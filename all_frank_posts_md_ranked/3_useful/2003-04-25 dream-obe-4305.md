<section>
I'm new around here, so hello to all you people, and I'll jump right into my question.
<br>
<br>
About a year or so ago, I was spending a lot of time with projecting, but since then I've been busy and had to cut down a lot.  Between then and now, I'll have the occassional spontaneous OBE, but lately I've been doing something different.
<br>
<br>
I'll be dreaming, not lucidly, and I'll sit down and have a conscious exit from my dream body.  I go through all the steps in my dream; induce a trance, sometimes I'll feel vibrations - when I do they're very strong - and I'll climb right out of my dream body.  Once I'm out, I'm lucid, but only of the OBE and not the original dream - follow me?
<br>
<br>
My question is first, has anyone else had any experiences like this, and do you think it's a valid method of projecting from a dream, even if I'm not lucid in the first place?  I appreciate any thoughts.
<br>
<br>
Paul

Hi Paul,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to the forum!

<br>
<br>
A lot of people have pulled OBE's out of dreams, including myself. In fact, most OBE's come about whilst already sleeping at first.
<br>
<br>
There is a way to purposely induce an OBE whilst dreaming: Make yourself aware that you're dreaming and focus on an element of the dream. It can be an object, a colour, etc. Keep focusing on/staring at it until the dream scenery fades away. You will find yourself in either the Real Time Zone, a lucid dream or the astral proper (I usually end up in the RT zone.)
<br>
<br>
I must also add that the first few experiences we have tend to be OBE's that seem like lucid dreams. While having the experience, we "know" it's for real and then we only question ourselves when we wake up. It's believed to be an OBE with all mental imagery, as the distortions kick in as soon as we exit. OBE's in the RT zone often have distortions of one type or another, either coming from the mind or mental energy left in the plane. However, these first few projections contain all mental imagery because the mind kicks in as soon as we exit.
<br>
<br>
As you progress, you'll eventually be able to figure out what are lucid dreams, what are OBE's and what are hybrid experiences. It's very easy to be confused at first.
<br>
<br>
Good luck,

Thank you for the response and the help; I'm sure you get lots of people asking similar questions.  I've been using the NEW system for a couple weeks now, and it's already made all the difference in the world as far as remembering spontaneous projections go.  Anyway, thanks again, and I'll be sure to try to focus on something the next time I catch myself dreaming.

This is also the method that I use to project. I find it effective, but its more random because it relies on a lucid dream.

Paul: Projecting from a lucid dream was my main method for years. It's a bit hit and miss by comparison to the Phasing methodology I've been working on of late. But I still do project from a lucid dream several times per week, in addition to the work I do each morning. So please take it from me it is a very *valid* method of projection.
<br>
<br>
Dreamscapes are formed from your own uncontrolled release of emotion while within the Astral realm. Therefore, the way to make the conversion is to gain control of your thoughts and become mentally still. The method Jeni gave you is a good way to help you do this. Once you have control your thoughts, all elements of the dream will quickly dissipate.
<br>

Yours,
