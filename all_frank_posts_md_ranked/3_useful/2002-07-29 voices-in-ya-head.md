Hey There.
<br>
I was wondering if anybody else has this.  Most Nites when I'm dozing off, I hear voices, and sometimes Slamming Doors.  I can hear talking, sometimes there is only 1 voice, and sometimes there is more.  I think that One Guys Name is John, and hes there to help me.  By help, I mean show me around, or show me something, that is what I feel at least.
<br>
<br>
Also, I hear these voices, and slamming doors with my Mind, not my ears.  There is a huge difference.  Its not like the audible noises that you pick up with your ears.  I call it my "Minds Ear".
<br>
<br>
Just wondering if this Happens to Anybody Else.
<br>
<br>
Cheers

<br>
Yep, all sounds about right.
<br>
<br>
Can be a tad difficult to get used to, at first, and they can become darned inconvenient when you ask them about something and they come back with all the wrong things.
<br>
<br>
I work with horses, as a hobby, and I'm dealing with this TB Irish horse at the moment that's stretching my knowledge to the limit. I called out for some help and, the other morning, the answer appeared in the form of a voice that began reading out to me all kinds of training techniques.
<br>
<br>
It took me only a few seconds to realise he must have been from the middle ages, or something, as nothing related to my problem. I tried to shoo him away but he wouldn't go, and just kept on telling me about all kinds of stuff I didn't need. Managed to project away from him in the end.
<br>
<br>
The most interesting auditory experience that I have had, to date, was meeting what I initially called a "musical entity" that I found out was, in fact, a dog. His past master used to be fond of classical music and he ever so much wants to become, "One like me" as he calls it.
<br>
<br>
He has such a fragile little soul and is crying out to learn. It seems that in some way he has been assigned to me. He reads my thoughts and plays me the most beautiful pieces and is desperate for me to "take him on".
<br>
<br>
I haven't the heart to tell him I haven't got the faintest clue what he is on about. But the entity is of such a sweet disposition it is hard to refuse. In any event, I wouldn't know what I'd be "refusing" or "accepting".
<br>
<br>
It often comes to me while on the Astral threshhold. I'll be just about ready to mentally "step in" and, out of the blue, I'll hear classical music. It is so enchanting I often find myself drifting off into an endless void with the music enveloping me.
<br>
<br>
At the other end of ther scale, there are all the pops, bangs, tearing sounds, knocking noises, etc. that you just get used to ignoring after a while. But they still catch you out.
<br>
<br>
Just this morning I was lying in a half awake, half asleep state and I heard a knock-knock-knock on the front door. Thinking it was the postman wanting a signature (it was around usual delivery time) I went downstairs and opened the door only to find I'd been caught out, yet again!
<br>
<br>
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I think the auditory side of things can be developed into a skill that I believe is called "clairaudience".
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Its really funny that you should mention the "front door" incident that happen to you this morning.  Just this morning I heard the "Knock Knock" at the front door, and I came running out and opened the door expecting to see My Roomates Mom.  To My Surprise there was nobody there!  I looked around, looked out at a different angle through the window, and there was Nobody there!

I knew what happened.

ZPE Hi,
<br>
Your not alone. I have heard doors slam, running water, voices loud and soft while I am almost to sleep. I am just used to it and when it happens it is only for a minute or less right before I am gone off to sleep land!
<br>
<br>
Peace be with you, Robin

Apparently, (I've only just learned) that these voices/noises/laughs/screams etc.  Are from other "Egos" and you hear them when you are on the threshhold of AP.  So, if your like me, and you get them almost everynite, learn to get familiar with the feeling, and it will most likely be Eazier for you to AP from there!

Okay- this is interesting. while out of body I experience "thought communication" with whatever entity I bump into.
<br>
However- one night a very powerful entity came and found me- while I was still in my body. I instantly regretted my decision to summons her because I was terrified out of my wits unlike I ever had been before. I saw nothing (no astral eyes to look with)  and heard no thought communication. What I did hear was a _real voice_ though it was distinctly non human sounding. But here's the kicker- I only heard it in my left ear. She was so close I expected to feel her breath, but there was none of course.
<br>
I noticed that I had to clear my toughts to hear-otherwise it sounded like scratchy static-I could not listen and think at the same time. My first question of couse was "how do I not be afraid of you." but she didn't respond- only told me what she was there to tell me and left.
<br>
In case anyone's curious it was "You are not one, you are four. You will always be."
<br>
I think it means something about re-incarnation.

I just started my studies on OBE's (about a week).  For right now I am just learning to meditate.  Over the last week I have had 2 distinct noise/voices.
<br>
<br>
1.  The first was a meditation session I had on my couch.  I was really relaxed, my entire body was numb and I felt like someone had pushed me deep into my couch...then I heard my own voice ask myself, "Are you there?".  It wasn't an audible voice as if I could point to the direction of where that person is in the room but a voice within my ear itself..very distinct.  My voice was so sudden it brought me out of my meditation.
<br>
<br>
2.  2 Nights ago, I was trying another place of meditation..my bed.  I was feeling the same as the first encounter, relaxed, pushed into my bed, and numb when I heard like a loud crash/popping sound to my right.  I don't know what it is but broke my meditation.  I guess I have to learn to go with the flow of noises.
<br>
<br>
Whats interesting is I heard these noises alot in my life right before bed and just recently realized after reading on the subject of OBE's its a normal occurence during a deep trance state.  For now, I look forward to my nightly noise encounters.

 <br>
 One time, when I was close to quieting my mind I heard a lound, almost, vibrating voice. It was saying "FUUUURRRRNNNEEEERRRRNEEEERRRRNNEEEERRRRR". I didn't really have any emotion to it. It did it a couple of times before my mind got so active I couldn't concentrate anymore and gave up.
 <br>
 <br>
 Another time, I think I was talking to my spirit guide. I was trying so hard to contact her, but of course I couldn't quiet my mind. Then I heard her in my head, but it was more of a thought so at first I thought it was one of my owns then I realized that it was a question. I can't really remember what she asked, but I answered her. Then I asked her name, and I felt 'Keri" (exact spelling) so strongly that I got so excited to actually make contact with some one that I couldn't concentrate anymore.
 <br>
 <br>
 I think I like the sounds, and voices.

Yeah, I get this one a lot!I can't really seem to communicate with them... its just a lot of chatter, disconnected shards of conversations. I used to amuse myself with it when i was a child... I remember once distinctly hearing the words "oh, it's my greek auntie". So there you go, no deep meaningful messages coming from my voices!!

When I used to meditate frequently( quite a while ago ) when I lost focus
<br>
on my thoughts( ok, I dont meditate like the monks I meditate in my own way )
<br>
I would hear voices having conversations and I was like a listener.
<br>
I used to call it mind-drifting because this happens before I fall asleep and
<br>
it feels like drifting off, I try to avoid drifting

<section>
hello,this is my 1st post.i have had many experiences of hearing voices,crashes,screams,etc while in the borderline state.several times i would feel someone press down on the mattress as if sitting on the edge of the bed ,this alway sparks my attention and lucidity.this being would then start talking in a very quiet voice (barely audible).mostly philosophical stuff i think.quite often when im fully awake i hear someone talking to me from within-usually in short sentences-advice that is important or mundane.these are  definatelynot "my thoughts".these kinds,and other kinds  of experiences (see the post about black fog on the floor-geez)seem to increase in frequency the more you practice meditation and astral projection.sometimes while in a dreamless lucid state ive had entire conversations with an unseen being.are these aspects of the self,or separate entity?

Jason, I'd say "yes!" to your last question, but I know that would probably annoy and/or confuse you!  It could be both . . . your Superself (or higher self), or an actual Entity who has taken an interest in you.
<br>
<br>
Fact is, in the cosmic sense, we're all ONE really . . .  and "otherizing" our encounters with the One is simply a tool we use to cope, lest our little heads explode or something.  I suppose the best answer is, who do you want it to be?  (Oh, the more cosmic I get, the more irritating I must get, I think.)

Has anyone had their name being called while tranced?  I was in a deep trance laying in my bed and then I hear my name being called in my head. It was a soft faint voice.  Some times I hear conversations (kind of jumbled together) but never my name being called.  Earlier that day I heard my name being  called again while I was working in the kitchen.  Scared the pants off me!  And another time  the voice mocked what my daughter had just said in a humorous voice but much slower than when she said it.  I have not heard any voices since then that was 3 weeks ago.

I get this on occasion too.  I've had a couple pretty disturbing insidences too.  Such as a few days ago, I was meditating and I heard a voice in my head say "I want you to kill yourself.".  And I had it happen a couple other times ever since I was in the 6th grade (I'm a sophmore in high-school now).  I don't know what this is or what causes it, but it's reall creepy.
