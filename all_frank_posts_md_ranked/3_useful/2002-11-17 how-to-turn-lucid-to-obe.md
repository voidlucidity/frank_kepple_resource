<br>
I have had a couple of times this kind of experiences and OBES.When I was in
<br>
dream enviroment I decided to jump  high  as possible ,because I have read this could  trigger lucid dream to obe, but again after I jumbed I was back in my body with sleep paralyse and that situtation is very unpleasent so I forced myself  to wake
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///up.is" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

<br>
The lucid dream state is basically Monroe's mental Focus 22. In other words, you are situated right on the edge of the Astral realms only without much of a degree of mental control. Basically, you know you are dreaming but that's really all.
<br>
<br>
In order to progress from this state, what you need to do is concentrate on bringing your whole sense of conscious awareness into play. One of the ways you can do this, is to first try and become completely still following which you look at some aspect of your dreamscape and ask yourself a question about it.
<br>
<br>
As you begin to question, your mind will bring other mental aspects into play such as your critical faculties, coupled with faculties of recognition. Once these come on stream, alongside comes your short-term and long-term memory banks, etc. to the extent where you develop the same full waking consciousness that you normally have with you within the Physical, only you are within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
At this point, you will be in control enough to be able to develop a particular Intent to go wherever you feel like going. (Within the Astral, Intent is the fuel that drives you to places.)
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

<br>
Yes, the dream environment is an Astral place. But you don't always get the complete kind of waking consciousness that you have while wide awake and alert on the Physical. This is something you need to work on doing.
<br>
<br>
For example, sometimes people will project and can only see in black and white. Some people have difficulty seeing true 3D shapes. Others project without being able to see anything and then, after a short while, their sight will come to them. You see, at first, you need to work at bringing all your mental faculties into play.

i frequently have lucid dreams but i have not managed to move to a real time OBE. i think it is worth trying to but i think working on rope is a better idea
