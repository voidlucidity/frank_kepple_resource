Hi folks.
<br>
<br>
My experiments with phasing continue with slooooooooow steady progress which is fine by me, although I am still at the whim of the 'random phasing effect'; that is, about once a week, I usually wake at 5 or 6 am at the required state and find it ridiculously easy to bring on the astral screen effect. However, it is still quite rare for me to actually step into the scene as I am still getting over the novelty of just 'sitting there' observing what's going on. btw, the other 6 days a week I get no results. It seems with me that I am programmed for once a week excursions and there's nothing I can do about it!
<br>
<br>
Anyway, a question:
<br>
As intent is the fuel that decides your destination while phasing, is it possible to place intent to go to a RT location rather than an astral one?
<br>
The reason for this is that a few early mornings ago, I woke up to find myself in the right state, brought about the astral window, and found myself viewing my grandfather's study, at his home in Dumfries. I stepped through and wandered around for a bit. Everything seemed normal, the light level from outside was consistent with the time of morning. I walked over to the bookshelf and was scanning over the titles when I was pulled back....... my bladder was complaining!
<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure this was the RT zone but it made me think about this issue. It's just that everyone talks about using phasing techniques to explore the astral but rarely mention RT excursions using this method. I certainly found it very stable, much more so than previous obes using the traditional method.
<br>
<br>
However, how do I know that I was in the RT zone and not the astral proper? I suppose there is no way of telling for sure, but my bet is, if you placed intent to visit a RT zone location, I don't see why you wouldn't go there to start with, but after that it depends how 'grounded' you are for you to remain there. If you loose it emotionally then you will fade out of the RT level (which technically is ALSO an astral level but is so close to the RTZ as to be indistinguishable from it).
<br>
<br>
Any thoughts anyone?
<br>
BTW I am currently subscribing to Monroe's theory that astral excursions have strange effects on your bladder!

Douglas: When you say "RT location" I see for your example you mean a location on this planet within this current timeline.
<br>
<br>
I see no reason why it should not be possible. It's an idea I've been toying with, on and off, without much success. Which is a bit weird because lately I've had some great success travelling

different timelines. But travelling to specific locations within a timeline requires a knack I've yet to develop.

If you are familiar with the location and everything seemed to add-up, so to speak, chances are you

at the location in question.

My experience of projecting within the RT-zone in the normal sense is next to none. So specific advice is a bit thin on the ground, here. What you say makes good sense. A good way I found which I use to qualify all kinds of experiences is to simply repeat the experience a number of times and note what differs (if anything). This is something I do very regularly.

Losing it emotionally is one of the worst things a person can do as it totally screws the projection. Though my experience at RT-zone projection is precious little, I would imagine losing-it emotionally within the RT-zone would screw the experience the same as it would within the Astral.

Hi Frank,
<br>
I don't see how the timeline would even be an issue. If you have intent to travel to another RT location like, for example, Edinburgh Castle or whatever, then you should go there.
<br>
<br>
Now, while doing this, I would not even be thinking about timeline issues and so on, so I would travel there with an automatic assumption that it is the here and now; therefore I dont see why there would be any kind of problem.
<br>
<br>
BTW, I would love to hear about some of your 'timeline flitting' experiences. Although I am still trying to get my head round this idea about how time-space doesnt exist outside of our physical universe.
<br>
<br>
BTW, remember the discussion about other physical civilisations in this or other physical universes? I was saying that Monroe came to the conclusion that we were alone in our physical universe. Actually that was totally wrong!
<br>
What actualy happened was that he couldnt find any other physical civs on his  early travels (not suprising when you remember that there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone!), but once you get further on in the book he is told on no uncertain terms that there are indeed *many* other learning centres similar (but also different) to ours ( the ELS) throughout what we know as our 'physical universe', and thats not even counting all the others on different time-space dimensions! At one point he describes looking up at the stars wondering which ones out there have planetery civilisations (or learning centres) around them.
<br>
<br>
Apparantly, Monroe was told that Earth has evolved to be a bit different from other planets however, in that we are almost the only species to use verbal communication whether most others use NVC - as Monroe calls it, in much the same way as its used on the astral.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I would tend to agree with this, because if you look at most of the more reliable abduction accounts, one thing that is almost universal (pardon the pun) about them is that the aliens are telepathic.
<br>
<br>

<br>

There are over 300 Billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy. Even by conservative estimates there are probably at least approximately one Billion Earth-size worlds that may be capable of sustaining life. So Okay, maybe you are a pessimist and don't think that there is any other technological civilisation in the galaxy.
<br>
There are more galaxies than there are stars in the Milky Way. The mathematical odds of life existing elewhere in the Universe are Overwhelmingly in favor of life existing.[

Chances are pretty high there are a number of "Edinburgh Castles" in multiple timelines. But, like I say, if you are familiar with that particular location and everything seemed to add-up then you were likely at that location, within our current timeline.
<br>
<br>
However, I have projected to places that look remarkably like those here on Earth, for example, and discovered the year was 1942. Yet no world-war was raging and no-one I met had never heard of a man named Adolf Hitler. In a similar vein, I projected to a place where the year was 1902. Yet the people obviously had the use of technology that we, in this current timeline, didn't have until around the 1970's.

A while ago I decided to quit exploring the Astral and concentrate on areas further out. The subject of timelines was one I found myself getting ever more curious about, coupled with my quest to discover what a higher-self is, exactly. That's when I came across the New Exchange Territories.
<br>
<br>
The examples given above are just 2 out of quite a number I have experienced in a similar vein since coming across this particular area within the New Exchange Territories. At the onset of projection I'd place the Intent to be directed to some area that would answer my questions about higher-selves and so forth. Each time I'd find myself at roughly the same place. It took me a number of visits before I could confirm that it was, actually, the same place and not a number of similar-looking places.
<br>
<br>
The area I kept being directed to is a fairly normal town with people going about their everyday business. But dotted amongst all the normal buildings are these large round structures. They stand out quite a bit which is why I first got curious about them. Within these structures are portals which I found can take you to places which, up until now, have looked remarkably planet-Earth like. However, like I say the events witnessed do not tally with the time-period in question.
<br>
<br>
All I have managed to extract from Harath thus far is the place is a point where various timelines intersect. Plus, this area is somehow significant in my higher-self research. The rest is up to me to unearth.
<br>
<br>
As regards Monroe: the more I discover about the "wider picture" the more I wonder if he was telling all that he knew; or whether he'd just touched on the more advanced aspects and his years of experience generally caused him to make good deductions from little evidence. Personally, I'm not sure.
<br>

Cheers Frank,
<br>
My opinion is that although Monroe is great, it is even more great how much further people like yourself are are going, using his work as a launch pad.
<br>
Perhaps 'further' is not the right word. Maybe 'wider' would be a better word to use.
<br>
At the end of the day, there is so much out there to explore, so much that it can be overwhelming at times.
<br>
Going back to Monroe's FJ again, when he is told about other planetery civilisations; when Monroe found out that Earth was actually just one of many 'compressed learning centres' which abound in our material universe and others, and when he considered this alongside the infinite astral worlds, he reported feeling overwhelmed and very small indeed, although at the same time 'never alone'.
<br>
<br>
I'm also reminded of Gandalf and Bilbo Bagggin's last bit of dialogue at the end of the Hobbit:
<br>
Gandalf: 'you're just a small Hobbit in a very large world after all!'
<br>
'Thank Goodness!', said Bilbo and handed him the tobacco jar.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Douglas.

PS Frank, have you checked out the astral locale thread that Adrian has started? Its a good idea and some of your input would go down well there!

<section>
hello, frank
<br>
<br>
when time permits would you please go into more depth concerning "exploring beyond the astral", and the "new exchange territories".
<br>
<br>
for example: "when" in the process do you place your intent, and
<br>
<br>
then do you simply passively observe, or do something active?
<br>
<br>
also, over the years i've read about, and spoken to a few people that supposedly reach the "mental" planes.   i believe adrian has some experience in this area.    these planes are generally described as beyond the astral, and "indescribable".
<br>
any idea where the new exchange territories fit in this vast ocean of realities?
<br>
<br>
thanks for your views on this, and your many phasing posts.
<br>

<section>
Frank -
<br>
I agree with christuone and Gandalf. Your adventures in different timelines sounds interesting. Perhaps you would be so kind as to share one of those experiences with us. [

<br>
The idea of discovering the great abilities and character of a higher self through an experience in another time line Does make sense. An experience in another time line (or alternate universe) should be both vaguely familiar and reassuring to the person projecting while still being essentially new and 'different'. [8D]
<br>
Without going into great detail or being dogmatic I subscribe to the concept of a 4 dimensional universal energy Matrix. In the Matrix it is Consciousness that largely decides what is real and what the person experiences. Your experiences theoretically confirm the hypothesis that it is at least theoretically possible for very skilled (at projection) individuals (like yourself) to deliberately choose their own preferred reality (by choosing which timeline to inhabit).
<br>
BTW I believe that in due time (pun intended) the Holographic Universal Matrix Theory will gain widespread scientific acceptance.
