both your physical and your upper bodies share the same consciousness and memories, so if you become conscious in one of your upper bodies, you will most obviously have the same 'personality'. it's not like when you astral project you're way of thinking is going to change, and you're going to lose all memory of your past experiences.

Well, seeing as I believe we ARE our souls, in other words the soul is what moves the body, it's obvious the souls has a personality.
<br>
The body is just a vehicle for working on the physical nothing more, take away the souls and you end up with so much chemical waste.

There is a lot of misunderstanding about what constitutes a "soul". Layer upon layer of religious conditioning has led to much confusion.
<br>
<br>
Your soul is simply the mind part of you which is currently operating through your physical body. All your memories, thoughts, personality, and so forth, are a product of the mind. The mind is retained after the physical body dies. With no physical body to occupy, the mind automatically begins operating through whatever "body" it requires wherever it happens to be resident.
<br>
<br>
Most people end up within the 4th density Exchange Territories. Here people tend to occupy a body which tends to be modelled on their previous physical body. Same goes with the houses they build and the lifestyle they they lead. All of which makes the place look very planet-Earth like.

A true "soul" has no personality. But a spirit or manifestation of that soul in some form will.
