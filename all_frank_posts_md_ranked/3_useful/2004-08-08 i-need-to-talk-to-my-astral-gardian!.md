I've had two recorded AP's. Both I'm 95% sure happend. I've started practicing the art of projection a few months ago, for proof of the afterlife and to descover myself. Both astrals projections were very short (1 second), so I really had no time at all to do anything. I"ve been going through a lot

Personally, I doubt that OBEs or APs are proofs for the after life. Maybe for ESP or that the consciousness can exist out of body while being alive (remember, you're still connected to your body while having these experiences), but not for the after life.
<br>
<br>
If you want to _believe_ (and it's a complete belief thing, you will only really know if one exists the time you die) in the after life, stick to one of the religions. Or create your personal one.
<br>
<br>
(Damn ... I can't believe I suggested something like that ...)
<br>
<br>
For this astral guardian thing ... well ... hmm ... what about ... astral projecting? I know you try it already, so continue with it, and eventually you will succeed and then you can talk with him/her/it/whatever.

In one of the books i read about AP's/OBe's w/e you wnna call them. It said when your physical body dies you go into your astral body. I believe that so it is proof of the afterlife (IF you believe that that is)

What do you define as an afterlife?  I mean without a definition, you can't answer the question.  Do you mean the ability to interact with the real world after the physical body dies?  Do you mean teh Muslim view of Heavan?  Do you mean some all energy version where everyone meets up?  I'm curious?

Hi wer,
<br>
<br>
There is a great little book that I read about 8 years ago you might like. It's called
<i>
 Many Lives, Many Masters
</i>
by Brian L. Weiss, MD. He's a psychiatrist who was not a believer in reincarnation, and in the book makes some fascinating discoveries. These revelations convinced his scientifically trained mind that there is in fact an afterlife, and also that reincarnation does exist.
<br>
<br>
Give it a read and draw your own conclusions. I did hear him speak about 5 years ago, and he is also a great speaker. You should be able to find his book at your local bookstore, or online. By the way, welcome to the Astral Pulse forums!
<br>
<br>
All the best,
<br>
Nick

Being able to have astral projections or out of body experiences, repeatedly and in a highly controlled way does in fact eventually provide a person with proof of an "afterlife". Though I personally cannot stand that term, and every living person on this planet is as dead now as they are ever going to be.
<br>
<br>
With respect to any other member with a differing opinion, I don't buy the argument about whether or not consciousness can live outside the physical body when the physical body dies. Saying that makes the assumption that a person's conscious resides within the physical body in the first place, which it doesn't. Although I have said in the past that conventional medical science has yet to cotton-on to this.
<br>
<br>
Whilst having an obe, it is the case that a person's physical body is still "connected". Reason being, if it weren't, the physical body would die. Again, people make the assumption that the physical body, notably the brain, is what somehow keeps consciousness alive. I'm sorry to take issue, but it is in fact the other way around. (Though I can well understand why people would think differently.)
<br>
<br>
In my experience there is no concrete definition of an "afterlife" that can be generally applied. Because the consequences of physical-body death can differ so wildly between individuals. There are those who simply slip off to the higher Astral and continue living as normal, having a home, chatting to friends, travelling to places, etc. Yet there are the less fortunate who, through various misunderstandings, end up being stuck in the lower Astral in a melting pot of their own making.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Frank

<br>
<br>
Why would the body die? And how do you _know_ that the body dies without this connection?

Hi Frank,
<br>
It's good to see you posting again. You've been missed around here[
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]. I must say I agree with everything you have said. The concept of death is a stumbling block for many to understanding. Being outside the physical brain is another cause of confusion.Thanks for explaining this so simply.
<br>
<br>
This also fits into what I believe to be multidimensional existence.I don't have as much practical obe experience as you most likely, but I've come to the same understanding.

<br>
<br>
The physical body would die because its source of life energy would be cut off.
<br>
<br>
How do I know this? Well, when a person learns to project to non-physical realms with a high degree of proficiency they are free to explore and ask questions. This is one of the areas I am particularly interested in so have done quite a lot of study in this regard and have been shown a number of examples of the death process as it was happening and have attended lectures, etc.
<br>
<br>
The non-physical realms are chock full of people engaged in all manner of pursuits. Just like on the physical but even more so. There you can find out about all manner of things such as where you came from, other lives you might have, how this works, how that works, etc., etc. It really is a truly fascinating place.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
how do i speak with my astral guardian?
<br>
<br>
well i alone had no succes with this, cause i have some problem...anyway i'm kind of...
<br>
<br>
u don't need to be in the astral to talk to your astral guardian you just need to get yourself in a trance deep enough.
<br>
<br>
i do "past life regresion", after exporing some part of there previeus lives, i put the subject to talk to there angel or astral guide or both, i hope for adviceses.
<br>
<br>
so my advice, go ahead and learn hypnosis, trance state etc. after go and find a nice book on past lives with exemples. for a regresion you don't need to be deep, but if you enter in regresion you can talk to your guide. take a friend to help you.
<br>
<br>
i done this many time with my subjects, oh n\by the way don't put many questions be a little sceptic, and there are many question that he/she can't answer you.
<br>
<br>
well...i'm sorry for my bad english...good luck and have fun
