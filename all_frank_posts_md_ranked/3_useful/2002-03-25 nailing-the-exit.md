<section>
I've been attempting Astral Projection unsuccessfully for about a year now, reading various books, websites, etc.  I recently picked up Astral Dynamics and I really enjoy the book.  It isn't like anything else I've read.
<br>
Now, here's my dilema.  I have gotten pretty good at successfully relaxing my body and calming my mind, then entering the trance state.  However, I just can't nail the exit!  I sometimes get vibrations, swaying sensations, etc, and sometimes I don't get anything.   When I begin with the rope technique,  I feel as though the pressure is forcing me to break trance.  I catch myself holding my breath, or tensing muscles.  Then, before I know it, I've killed the trance.  For some reason, I can't let go of the physical.

I've had one OOBE and amazingly enough yesterday I thought i'd had another but someone said it was prob a lucid dream. The OOBE lasted for about 1 minute because I kinda got scared and forced myself back into my body. It only took me about a month to accomplish it, I spent most of the month meditating and relaxing and concentrating on leaving my body but not forcing it to happen, i'd spend all my spare time laying down and calming my body, the OOBE happened one night when I woke up feeling sick, I went for some milk then went back to bed, I was very tired and got very relaxed and decided this was a good time to try and have an OOBE cos everything was perfect (thought I may aswell try) after a couple of minutes my mind must have just gone quiet, I dont think I was even thinking about OOBEing then suddenly I heard a sound in my ears as if my head was under water, I tried to move but was paralyzed at which point I realized IT'S HAPPENING! I concentrated on the sound until it stopped and as soon as it did I could move - I lifted my hand and it felt like it went through something (possibly my bed cover) my hand was making cackling sounds as though it was static and I looked at it - it was a bit blurry and so was the rest of my room but I could make out it was my room. Because i'd read so much on OOBEs I knew it would be hard to get away from my body so decided to try rolling off my bed, as I did so I seemed to hover a bit and thats when I thought I saw a shaddowy figure stood at the head of my bed so naturally freaked out and forced myself back into my body - worst thing I could have done since i've not been able to have another since.
<br>
<br>
My advice to you is that if you wake in the middle of the night and are still tired to try and have an OOBE then.

Hi Froggman,a lot of what Hephaestus rings true for me as well.
<br>
You sound like you are on the edge of OBE but because you are so
<br>
consious of their reality &amp; are analysing your body for the slightest change you are creating a block for yourself.
<br>
I concur with Hephaestus, dont try to have an obe,if you can get
<br>
into the trance great! just think to yourself "I,m just going to
<br>
have a nice deep trance,thats all" &amp; after a few times doing this
<br>
you will just fall into an OBE &amp; wont even be trying.
<br>
<br>
All the best on your journeys
<br>

 This is actually very good advice!
 <br>
 <br>
 The main problem with OBE is achieving the necessary states of relaxation and trance while in a fully waking state. This of course takes practice, and meditation.
 <br>
 <br>
 But, you can also create this environment from the waking from sleep state either by setting your alarm clock an hour or so earlier then you would normally arise, or by taking a short nap during the middle of the day. You just then need the presence of mind to immediately try an OBE exit, e.g. by using "rope" or a similar method.
 <br>
 <br>
 Best regards,
 <br>
 <br>
 Adrian.

Just to add onto the greatness of that advice..... The only OOBE I ever had was when I woke up in the middle of the night and tried it then...

 You use the ROPE technique in order to bring yourself to the point where you begin to feel vibrations.
 <br>
 <br>
 What the ROPE technique serves to to is 1) provide a focal point of conciousness to the exclusion of all other thoughts, feelings, etc., and 2) it gives a powerful visual signal to the sub-conscious that you want to transfer your conscious mind into the projected body and go some place other than where your physical body happens to be.
 <br>
 <br>
 If you start rope-climbing at the vibration stage, chances are you will upset the process.  This appears to be what is happening in your case.
 <br>
 <br>
 First, understand that the separation is fully automatic.  The trick is to bring yourself up to the vibration stage and then simply let separation happen!
 <br>
 <br>
 Tensing muscles and upsetting the smooth progression of the breath are caused by tiny fears, doubts, etc.  Which will go away once you experience projection a few times. After all, you are on the brink of the unknown (according to your conscious awareness at the time).  So it is only natural for it to feel a teeny bit nervous.  Which in turn upsets the projection process.
 <br>
 <br>
 What I did was, as the vibrations began I found I could modulate their intensity by regulating my breathing.  So I spent time just experiencing the vibration-sensation thus allowing my conscious mind to get used to them.
 <br>
 <br>
 The way you separate is just to let it happen.  If you try and "do something" the process will be interrupted.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank

Well said Frank!
<br>
I reckon it´s important not to try hard, just letting it happen pretty much once the vibrations sets in, witout any regards of wether or not you are going to succeed. If it happens, it happens, if not, there are countless new moments to come.  And of course, any moment is a potential OBE moment.

Thank you all for your helpful comments thus far!
<img align="middle" border="0" src="icon_smile.gif"/>
<br>
That is certainly something I haven't thought of, the fact that I may be TRYING so hard that I'm throwing off the natural occurance.  However, FRANK, I don't think the tense muscles and breathing come from fear.  They couldn't because I am certain that there is nothing to fear, I want it really bad!  From what I've gathered, it seems that by
<i>
 wanting
</i>
so bad, I am trying too hard and thus bringing the physical constraints into play.
<br>
Once again, thanks to everyone for helping me.  I'll try (or rather,
<i>
 not
</i>
try

) some more and see what happens.

<br>
Believe me, they come from fear.  When I use that word I do not mean in a normal, physical sense.
<br>
<br>
All kinds of uncertanties, let's say, can upset the natural process of separation.  It's fear in the sense of being uncertain of the outcome. But it is a very normal stumbling block you can easily learn to overcome.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
interesting thing about this experience is similiar to my one time
<br>
<br>
The room was dark there was a sense of someone there, not friendly either.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if this whole astral stuff is just demonic like wiji boards lol
<br>
<br>
or if we are just creating and seeing our deepest fears
