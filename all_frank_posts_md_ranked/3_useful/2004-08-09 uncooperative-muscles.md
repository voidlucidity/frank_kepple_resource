I'm happy to say that I'm getting to the trance state very easily!  I'm less happy to report that my nice trance is disrupted by muscle spasms and the need to shift positions.  I do progressive relaxation before I start my meditation, but apparently it's not enough.  Any suggestions on how to relax the body more?  I figure a warm bath might help, and I'm considering massage.

Massage always helps, I tend to ignore my body now though.

Hypnosis for relaxation?  Like before I start the meditation, I need someone to hypnotize me?

I'm like gravy, just ignore your physical.
<br>
<br>
It will get better the more you practice, you just have to keep it up is all, believe me... been there done that.[

you don't need anyone to hipnotise you you can do it yourself:
<br>
make affirmations what do you want to achieve that you are totally safe and such
<br>
state that you will move your eyes left and right counting from 20, on 1 you will fall into trance (whatever you want to achieve)
<br>
do so, preferably with closed eyes, but it's not a must

One way I find useful is to try to keep the physical body relaxed as much as possible all the time. I'm not sure how true this is with the population at large, but it does seem to me that a lot of musular tension begins in the mind.
<br>
<br>
In my life I've come across people who were always uptight about one thing or another, and that same mental tension did appear to be reflected in their physical body also... tense shoulders and forehead, neck pains, back pains, etc, etc.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, what you have to do is focus your attention away from the physical. How I do this is by having something non-physical, i.e. something within the mind to focus on.
<br>
<br>
As Nay rightly says, somehow you have to find a way of just ignoring the physical. Which is a rather tricky mental balancing-act to achieve, but it does come good with practice.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps rather than somehow trying to find a way of ignoring the physical, turn it around and think more in terms of finding a way to make your inner reality more real - by concentrating within more. That way you'll find eventually the physical just falls away like you hadn't got one.

I'd like to ignore the physical, but I'm not sure how to do that when the spasms and such jar me out of the trance state, and then I have to start over :\

<section>
yeah the spasms/twitching happens to me. hypnosis tends to work great for me. Frank gave me a little trial of it.. where i can hear his voice while i lay down. it worked wonders. now i can go in a deep trance under a minute or two. i think his username is thehyponotist or sumthin of the sort.
