Ok! Here we go. Im so excited right now..I can hardly type. I wkoe up this morning, after comming half awake/sleep for a while...and I was semi-awake, aware, but extreemly relaxed after a good nights sleep. So I said, why not try to project..? So my breathing became deep, relaxed, and slower, all through my nose, though. And after a while of changing positions,,,BOOM...my body tingles a little at fierst...then starts to vibrate like crazy! A HUGE pulsing sound going all through me..I was so excited at first, it went away, so I did the same type of breathing again and after a very short period of time it came back! Full force!...It was so easy to urge them to return...It felt wonderful! I tried doing the ROPE technique, but nothing really happened (Lprobably because I was still excited) but I did feel a little more wavy than usualy...so I rolled ov er, trying to roll out of my body, but I actually rolled the physical body and the vibrations stopped. So I triesd to get them back again, it happend...and I tried to roll out again (im facing the wall, lol) So nothing really happens..but suddenly, the vibrations come to a type of flatline, and poof, their gone. And im like.."Is that it..?" So I try to open my eyes, but I cant. Im stuck! Sleep paralysis...wow. That was WEIRD...it stayed for a short while, but whenever I tried to move my body it got this big buzzing sound, like my body was asleep. I could move my tongue in my mouth...lol, but not actually open my mouth. So I tried to wiggle my finger, and I finally did, then I was able to move. Then I had a vision/dream of walking downstairs to tell my mom after she came up to my room to wake me up...and the dog was licking the floor and she told it to stop..&gt;&gt; Lol..sorry if im not making any sense! But I went down to tell her about it and I was on the stairs and I tried to tell her but she was leaving to go somewhere...so she said "Tell me later.." I finalyl woke up for REAL, went downstairs to tell her, and she told me to wait because I had to walk the DOGs...Imagine that..[

]??! Well, im guessing that ,last part was a dreamm, a precognitice one, telling me that my mom wouldnt tell me because of the dog that was in my room xD heh. lol...ok..well..I was just wondering if the vibrations were a dream as well..it FELT real, but the ending dream part is gicving me doubts, plus the vibrations were so EASY to bring on...almost felt natural...It felt GREAT..&gt;Ok...im done!

Oh yeah! Almost forgot..when I finally did tell my mom...she was like.."Thats not right Paul. Thats the work of the devil..God gave you a body for a reason, not to leave it." &gt;&gt;; That made me a little uncomfortable...and even a little angry, but iM not angry at her o_o; lol.

Great! Kudos for telling your mom. But being shot down is not that good, heh.
<br>
<br>
The first vibration is usually kinda rough but when you have more experience, it will smooth up. Nowadays I get the gentle buzzing kind of vibration. From my experience, when you get the vibration if I just relax in them, everything will unfold naturally. I prefer to bath or relax in them, the vibration washing me all over and then usually my body will float on it's own. If not, I can rollover or intent to float up. Pre-projection technique are useful to get to this state and you wouldn't want to start all over again.
<br>
<br>
Also if you find yurself stuck, you might try tricking yourself by using your fear of falling from the bed. I use this sometime and it did help. Be careful though, you don't want to fall off your bed.[

BTW, you could have an OBE that ends or get mixed with a dream though. There is no reason you can't dream while having a dream, similar to daydreaming, only more real. Awareness is very important.

Hello Paul
<br>
I was quite surpriced when i read your msg.
<br>
The reason? Well a quite simillar thing happened to me last morning.
<br>
I had woken up and was taking a nap (again) when  suddenly i felt seperating and i could see myself in my two forms, the astral and the physical. Just then i thought "hmmm now the vibrations must come" (which is wrong the vibes come before seperating) but they did come however.
<br>
Right after that i todl my mom "mom i had my first obre today"
<br>
This didn't happen in reality so it must have been a dream. So like you i wonder, was my initial seperation a dream too? i believe  fell into the Alice in Wonderland effect when i expected the vibes..
<br>
But yu never know do you?

Well done for getting a result. What you describe is how it generally is, at first. Lots of sensation and confusion. Feelings of inability to move various body parts. Often people get feelings of spinning around going no-where fast, and loads more besides.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is practice as often as you can. At least once a day is best for, say, half to one hour. People find early-mornings can be quite productive.
<br>
<br>
What I would do is just concentrate on getting a degree of familiarity with the various sensations. Once you do that, you will come to the stage where you'll discover the feelings can be controlled. So rather than suddenly... boom... the vibrations begin, you'll be able to modulate them so they come on smoother, and feel more of a light buzzing sensation. Plus, you will be able to sustain them at a particular pitch and intensity. As opposed to having them suddenly keep switching on and off.
<br>
<br>
What you need to do is get to the stage where you gradually bring on the vibrations and slowly increase them in pitch and intensity. As they gradually come in, there will come a point where you will feel like you suddenly developed the ability to defy gravity and take-off from your physical body.
<br>
<br>
I found the vibrations can be controlled mentally, but also try thinking about taking slow deep breaths while the vibrations are happening. You should find the breathing causes some interesting effects.
<br>
<br>
Note: when I say "breathing" you won't actually be taking physical breaths but it will feel as if you you are. In the same way the "vibrations" feel like your whole physical body is shaking. But it isn't really, it just feels that way.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I personally dont believe that having a OBE is a satanic act. Why? Because thats exactly what people said about flight. I personally think that having a OBE is a challenge which is almost everything in live. And dont get me wrong I am a Christian. So I would not do anything that would go against the will of God.

Paul: thank you for the feedback and I wish you the best of luck. Like I say, practice is the key. And do take Squeek's advice. Perhaps your parents are not the best people to consult right now. Maybe in a while once you have more experience.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank
