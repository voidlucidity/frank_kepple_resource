Hello!
<br>
<br>
I'm confused about the whole body-awareness thing, especially during vibrations.  I have read in a few places that you must not, in any circumstances be aware of your body and must try to keep your awareness out of your body.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand I often read that in order to project we must always be aware of our body.
<br>
<br>
I realise it may be different for different people but what are your views on this? At the moment I'm stuck lying there wondering where to put my awareness and when the vibrations start I end up panicking and losing them!
<br>
<br>
Thank you!
<br>

Bah
<br>
Dont make it harder than it is
<br>
<br>
Try just focusing on your breathing.  Some people do the bad black air out, good white air in imagery thing too if their mind wanders a lot.
<br>
<br>
Im tellin everyone..its all ya need..  Be patient..if your mind wanders or if you have a sudden snap of "awareness" or whatever, just gently continue...
<br>
<br>
It wont take many "serious" tries before you understand what they are saying dont focus on your body... but be aware of it...  None of that really matters..but it does make sense.. it's like you dont want to focus on your body because focusing on it will bring that part back awake or something... but you want to be aware that like...hey this is me laying here awake but in a trance..because if you arent, you might just slide into sleep.
<br>
<br>
Just make the effort...have the will.. dont do it right before bed if you expect results (you can still do it before bed..its just not a good time)  if you say im gonna do this... you will
<br>
<br>
its so easy to find that medative state..once you find it your gonna say crap its been here all along..and eventually you'll be able to do it in minutes

To me it all boils down to what you focus on. I aim to shift my focal point of awareness upwards to a point about the centre of my forehead; as opposed to where it normally is, which is at the backs of my physical eyes. I never think in terms of either being aware or being unaware of any kind of "body" as I find it grossly counter-productive. But that doesn't mean everyone will feel that way, naturally.
<br>
<br>
Basically, it boils down to finding a way that works and no two individuals are the same in this respect. Which is why I always advise people not to take what they read too literally (my work included). The art is in mixing and matching concepts you, personally, feel comfortable with. With the end goal of developing a projection solution tailored to yourself.

If you are reaching the stage where you feel vibrations then just keep doing whatever it is you do. Because it appears to be working. Don't worry, everyone panics at first. The key is to allow yourself to experience the experience. Which is ever so easy to say, and ever so tricky to do. Mentally clinging to the Physical is a common problem. Think of it like you were standing at the edge of an abyss: all you have to do is close your eyes, take a deep breath and jump.

Yours,
