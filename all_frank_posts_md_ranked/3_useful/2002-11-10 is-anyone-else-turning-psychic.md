I have noticed what I believe is a side effect of regular astral travel. I find myself suddenly "knowing" things. And I'm beginning to freak people out. At work they're calling me "the witch". Sometimes I even scare myself. What the hell is happening? Does anyone have a reasonable explaination?

While I'm at it I'd like to note that my EXTREMELY CHRISTIAN grandmother is the same way- she speaks descriptivly of leaving her body, referring to it as "being close to the holy spirit" saying that the knowledge she recieves about people and future events are "gifts of the holy spirit."
<br>
<br>
Ironically, she speaks of "new age" "fortune telling" and "meditation" as being "Dangerous and Satanic."
<br>
<br>
Does anyone think OBE's are hereditary? Anyone else have relatives that do this?

LOL: yes, what you are experiencing, to me, is very normal. Though I have long-since learnt to keep very quiet about this whole topic. Apart from publishing my experiences on this BBS of course. (Which I still find something of a novelty). It must happen at least once a day where something will come into mind about a friend, say, and next moment they are on the phone telling me what I just thought about.

More and more I find myself thinking of things, and then hearing about them on TV or in real life. The problem is, I can never be 100% sure if there's a logical explanation for it. I've always been this way...it used to be these things would happen on occasion; ever since I've been doing my OBE training it's increased tremendously, to the point where it's driving me crazy! (Although what bothers me more than anything else is trying to figure out if it's psychic ability or just my subconscious picking up on things on TV or people saying things without my conscious mind knowing it).
<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, a psychic I met recently told me that I was psychic.

I think the fact that "New Age" implies that there is some sort of change from the past Age, is what freaks people out. Oh well, ive learned to only talk about subjects relating to the New Age experince when it is solicitied from me in public, and here on the bbs. Just spouting off the fact that you can project out of body creeps people out,,,,

oops didnt see your last question about heredity. Yes, i think they are.
<br>
When i starting reasearching my spontanious OBEs, i found out that my dad also had them, but at 25 instead of 14. Hes 58 now, and the last spontatnious obe he had was in his late 30's. He told me the smae experiences i had and that he never wanted to feel like that again.
<br>
This leads me to believe that at the onset of spontanious OBE's the person has a choice to either push them away (and trust, alot prolly do this because of how frightneing spontanious OBE and sleep paralysis can be) or embrace them and use meditiation and energy techiniques to improve on the experience. My dad chose the latter, and hence he doesnt experience it anymore. I chose to embrace and train, and found myself to be a natural. Everything came to me pretty easy, from energy manipulation, concious OBEs, and now im training for aura reading.

I get have a song in my head at all times, so it's natural for me that some of the songs I get in my head might coincidentally come on the radio soon afterwards; but the other night at work, it happened 4 times.  That was a big against the odds.
<br>
The only other thing I notice is that I sometimes get a sense of what people close to me are feeling, even if they're not with me at the time.
<br>
As for heredity, it beats me, this isn't usually talked about in my family.  I don't come from a particularly spiritual background.

<section>
i dont come from a spiritual family either. however my mum did try to mimick the techniques in the chistos experiments and got out of her body! also my aunt used to have dream premonitions when she was younger. so if they are hereditory then there is hope for me yet!
<br>
If they're not though, it doesnt matter anyone can obe! its part of people and just needs training!! (just my belief)

At first, I thought I was developing a spiritual adeptevness. A few months ago, however, I learned that my mom's side of the family is rather spiritual. An odd twist if I must say, I think that my experiences have more or less only awakened what potential exists within me.

Hi Everyone! I think I'm becoming psychic, Sometimes I know things I shouldn't know, but it's not consistent yet, even though it happens more than it used to,. I hope it improves.

I can see the aura around basic objects, as well as the etheric energy surrounding living things (as a clear outline). I could see blue around my fingers once, but my auric sight isn't developed enough for me to see human aura very well.
<br>
<br>
I'm have very strong empathic ability / intuition, which allows me to experience moods, feelings that generally aren't my own. When I'm around a depressed person, for example, I can feel their sadness, which often puts me into a heavily state of feeling guilty and inclined to help them.
<br>
<br>
I've also seen aparitions on my occassions, and one point, I had a very profound experience where I saw what appeared to be a banshee (white-cloaked character, in a purely white energy field... there were sparks of white flickering in the aura... it was very weird!). The aura looks like a very irregular milky cloud, and had the colors of white, green, and yellow in it. It wasn't like what some people have described before (rainbow colors... in layers). This was different. the colors were just... out and about. Very hard to describe because I am having trouble recalling the memory exactly.
<br>
<br>
I've also had a number of weird experiences as well.

It's funny you mention this, because ever since I started having my OBE's, I've acquired a somewhat acute psychic ability.
<br>
<br>
For example, right now, I have a strong feeling that I'm not going to finish this sent......

<section>
I think there is some kind of heredity at work with this.  I mean you can't really deny that there are some people who just seem born to do this kind of stuff.  I know in my own family, my mothers side seems to be more pron to entity interactions and the occasional spantaneous OB.  My mother and aunt call it "flying" and have never really made the connection.  The only other thing that I have noticed with my family is that I seem to be the only male so afflicted, the result seeming to be that it is much stronger in me also.
<br>
But don't get me wrong I believe that it is with in every one to OBE and/or open themselves up in a way to allow for more psychic type phenomanon.  I know in me personally it has just gotten stronger since I started openly started to work on expanding those abilities and attempting OBE's.
<br>
It seems natural to me that once a person starts accepting that there is more out there than what is normally seem than things will start to happen.  It is just like learning anything else.
