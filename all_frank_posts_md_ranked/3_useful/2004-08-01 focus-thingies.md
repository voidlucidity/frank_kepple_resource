Your welcome! [

] There is also some great reading in the Welcome to Permanent Astral Topics forum. You can also take a look at the topic entitled: Astral Phasing methods for more information on focus levels.

The focus numbers are just an arbitary series of numbers Monroe used to label the various mental states people generally go through when undergoing a controlled Phasing to the various non-physical realms. They could have been called apples and pears, or whatever. In the sense that the actual numbers themselves hold no particular significance.
<br>
<br>
Monroe was an engineer, so I guess the numbers thing sort-of appealed to him more than the previous mystical-style labels that have been attached in the past.
