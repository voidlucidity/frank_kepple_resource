Hello Forum,
<br>
My name is Evan and I was wondering how you can go to the astral plane through a lucid dream? Some people say all you do is fly but I heard its not like that. People on this forum talk about going to the planes during a dream but dont say how to do it? Is a lucid dream some from of astral plane or what?

Realise there is no real difference between a dream; a lucid dream; dream initiated uncontrolled/controlled projection; or a full blown controlled conscious-exit projection within either the RT zone or the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Basically it is all Astral Projection. The major difference is *your* level of conscious awareness and the amount to which you can keep your thoughts and emotional-release in check.
<br>
<br>
As your sense of conscious awareness becomes more awake (while your physical body is sleeping) the more you perceive what is going on. Note: What we generally call "a dream" is just the uncontrolled release of emotion within the lower Astral regions with little or no sense of conscious awareness.
<br>
<br>
So if your sense of conscious awareness comes awake to the extent where critical faculties can come into play, then, chances are, you'll look at something in the dream that doesn't quite add up. Your critical faculties will say to you something like, "Hey, look at that [some dream anomoly] over there, it's [point out to you how it "should" be compared to how it currently is]."
<br>
<br>
In order to try and find an answer about this anomoly, Critical Faculties awaken your sense of curiosity. Curiosity, on seeing the anomoly, thinks, "Hmm, I wonder how that can be?" And in a further attempt to "solve the mystery" Curiosity awakens the senses of Logic and Reason together with associated Memory functions.
<br>
<br>
Once that happens, the answer becomes plain and you think, "I'm dreaming!"
<br>
<br>
At this stage, you have full conscious awareness on the lower Astral. The major problem, however, is you will be subject to
<u>
 all manner of reality fluctuations
</u>
*unless* you can quickly close down the emotional release that was fuelling the dream that you were having in the first place, and become mentally still.
<br>
<br>
If you can do that, your dreamscape will dissipate and you can begin exploring. If you wish to "travel" you do this by using Intent. Though, if you wish to explore the Astral with any degree of success, I would strongly suggest the first thing you do is become aware of the Astral residents who are guiding you.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

i've also read, i believe in ad, that if you aim for a spot right above the horizon and project yourself there by flying as fast as you can, that it will take you to a more astral, astral plane.

So clear your mind as if your meditating Â in the dream?
<br>
<br>
Every man has their fear of dieing, whether it be of pain or not knowing where you are going, however, mine is the family, memories, and good times i leave behind.
