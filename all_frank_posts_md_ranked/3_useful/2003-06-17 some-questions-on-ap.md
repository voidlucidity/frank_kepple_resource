I don't entirely get what you mean by Astral Projection. Is it where you simply imagine things happening exactly behind your eyelids? So much that you make a world in your head with rules and so it seems vivid? Or is it getting into a trance until you actually leave this world and cannot simply move your physical body anymore until you return. Is it a world where you can meet other people or is it all just part of your own dream? Could you actually control your movements in the dream, like, did you realise you were in it at the time? And can anyone Astral Project?

In addition to this Physical realm, there are other realms composed of non-physical matter. Even though the matter these realms are composed of is non-physical in nature: to the residents of these realms, this matter feels just as "real" as Physical-realm matter does to us.
<br>
<br>
It's a bit of a tricky mental balancing act to initiate, but it is possible to withdraw your focus of awareness from the Physical realm and project it within a non-physical realm. At which point, that non-physical realm becomes your reality. Which means you are free to interact with the residents of that realm in very much the same way as you can within the Physical.
<br>
<br>
So, yes, you could say it is a world where you can meet other people, make friends, and such like. The situation isn't quite so cut and dried because things are complicated by the fact that, within these non-physical realms, thoughts can so easily become things. In other words, you can end up repeatedly being at the mercy of your own thoughts.
<br>
<br>
The base level, non-physical realm is where most people do their dreaming. That's why one of the basic problems a lot of people have in the beginning is trying to sort out true Astral experiences from their own dreamscape. Which, again, is a little tricky but by no means impossible to do. It all depends on having a good level of mental control, which comes through practice.

Frank,
<br>
<br>
In your experience, how is your interaction in the astral or conversation carried out? Is it by thought transference or could it be like normal talk? What about with your guide?
<br>
<br>
Thanks.

Terry: In my experience, Astral residents speak verbally in very much the same was as we do while Physical. Which is the way I, personally, prefer. The problem is with that is, although you feel like you are communicating verbally (it feels very much like the same Physical action) the verbal aspect, i.e. the moving of the lips and so forth, is only a simulation.
<br>
<br>
Often I'll get a tad confused due to my mind-input getting out of sync with my "lips". So there will be times when I'm about to ask a question I already have the answer to. Which, to me, is the off-putting aspect about non-verbal communication. In the sense that it's all too quick. Personally, I like a staged "questioned followed by answer" format, especially when speaking with my regular guide, Harath.
<br>
<br>
So it's all down to personal preference at the end of the day. Perhaps the following is not all that relevant to the thread, but I do often get the idea people think they are somehow, "at the mercy" of Astral events. An example of this is where certain types of personalities repeatedly get bugged by "negs" for example.
<br>
<br>
But once you get to know what's what, how you communicate is basically down to personal preference. People who reside within the higher-level realms I find exceptionally helpful and are only too happy to chop and change their approach, if it will help you comprehend more the message they are trying to get across.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Thanks, Frank.
<br>
<br>
So it could be both. The reason I ask this is because there are time that the communication is sort of like I'm realising what the other convey without any verbalisation. Pretty strange and a little bit confusing to me. For instance I get the realisation that someone I'm conversing want me to follow her and the I automatically follow her, and then I arrive somewhere else. The transfer from realising and action seems to fast to me.
<br>
<br>
In my post "red cap guy" in obe exp forum I've met someone who I think have been pulling me out of body at least that last time. We talk normally so Iask him shouldn't we just communicate telephatically or somethimg like that but he just chuckle at my question (I still haven't gotten over his smugness..) His answer is always short (one word mostly, like "friend", "travelling" etc) and not what I expect at that moment.
