Getting yourself used to remembering APs will make it easier to recall the things later on as well, so you might still be able to get to those memories later, but you also might never remember.  Even so it does not really matter, don't dwell on the past, learn from it and move on.  Good luck in your future AP endevours.

When you get back to your body, don't move, don't open your eyes, focus on remembering. Much like dreams the more stimulus you give yourself the quicker things of the sort seem to slip away. I personally imagine writing my story of my OBE in my dream journal then get up and write it. No matter how brief the act of doing it helps solidify your desire to remember. If you get stuck just ask yourself "what was I just doing?" . . . "and before that?" it works for me.

The key to remembering is: do not trust the voice which says something like, "Oh, I can just drift off to sleep and I will definitely remember it in the morning." Because, chances are, as
<u>
 much
</u>
as the experience is burning in mind at the time you think that, upon awakening x-hours later... you will hardly remember a thing!
<br>
<br>
What I do is keep a notebook and pen beside my bed. I found that just jotting down 3 or 4 key words and phrases leads to near 100% recall even after several hours of sleep.

Oh, and something else I forgot to mention. If you do drop off to sleep and end up waking with little memory of the event, I found if you put yourself into a relaxed state then lost memories can often come flooding back.
