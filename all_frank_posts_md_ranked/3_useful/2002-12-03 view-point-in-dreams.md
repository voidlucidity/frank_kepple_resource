Hi,
<br>
When you are asleep and dreaming, your viewpoint is behind you. You are not looking out of your eyes, it is like looking out someone elses eyes behind you.
<br>
<br>
Why is this?

You don't have your body or your eyes with you. It is not necessary to even dream of having a body. Often I also dream of standing behind myself or of floating behind myself. It is easy to switch to controlling different bodies that way as the story line develops. Sometimes I just watch from above with no body, but active and direct participation is rare. It does happen for me.

Then I must be weird because my perspective when I dream, for the most part, is all first person.

I had a long dream last night where I had primarily 1st person POV but had a feeling that I was at times watching over my shoulder as well.
<br>
Actually that is typical of my dreams.

Most of the time I'm dreaming in 1st person, but third person happens often.
<br>
<br>
Things get really weird when you change to the perspective of a different person in the dream and are following them in third person.

It could be that this is the way you happen to habitually perceive yourself.
<br>
<br>
Within the Astral, with a little practice, you can switch views consciously. One of the weirdest I came across was when I discovered a kind of null-zone in my Astral awareness. The null-zone, as it turned out, was my physical body. So after a bit of practice I got to seeing Astral vision in 1st person; Physical vision in 1st person; and Astral vision giving me a whole 3rd person kind of overview... all at the same time.
<br>
<br>
This ability to switch between views goes to creating what R.Bruce aptly calls the "mind split" effect. Which can be quite freaky when you first come across it. Astral Dynamics contains some good info on this.
<br>

<section>
i read   somewhere that  your view is first person  if you are a more aware person  througout the day,  e.g a meditative state.    But  if you are  a bit of a day dreamer and are always off in your own world your viewpoint is 3rd person and you are watching yourself,  as if you were watching yourself in a movie.
<br>
<br>
since i started all of my spiritual work,  i happen to agree with this,  because since ive become more aware,   i dream  mainly in first person,  but i used to watch myself in the dream.

Hi,
<br>
I just looked at my dream journel and all of them are in first person.  Before I started doing OBE work, they were in third person. I think rodentmouse is right.

Here's what I've noticed since I first responded to this topic:
<br>
<br>
When I'm DREAMING (or projecting), I'm ALWAYS in the first person.  However, when I'm told to "imaging yourself walking along a path.....", I see myself in the third person.  So I guess when I'm consciously trying to recreate something in my mind, I do it in third person.  But when I'm consciously EXPERIENCING something, it's always in the first person.

<section>
Yes, the switch from 3rd person to 1st person is where I mentally step into the Astral scenary. It's the point where the the border is crossed between imagination and the Astral. There is also an inbetween state I get where it feels almost like I'm looking from a 1st person view. But it's only a kind of virtual 1st person, not actual. The best explanation I can think of is I'm in a condition where, I am imagining I'm not looking from a 3rd person view. Then follows the full transition to true 1st person.

My view is also first-person, whether in my dreams or in my mind's-eye.
<br>
For some reason, it's just too weird to "picture myself" in any way.  I don't even like to look in the mirror.  I just don't feel like who I would see there at all matches who I am.

<section>
Interesting topic.
<br>
I would be interested in finding out the reasons for and/or implications of either 1st or 3rd person dreaming.
<br>
<br>
I personally have dreams of a bit of both. I mostly have 1st person dreams to start, but there have been times...especially when I ( my dream character of myself) becomes highly emotional...at this point I tend to become sort of aware of this and detach (sometimes) from it to a 3rd person perspective.
<br>
When this happens I usually watch myself become emotional, but I am aware I am watching myself. This is not lucid, mind you, as I dont necesarily become aware I am dreaming - sometimes I do, and then we're talking a whole different experience - just that I am kindof watching my emotions pass.
<br>
I dunno if this is a side effect of meditation practice, or what...if anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences I'd love to know.
<br>
<br>
I never really thought of this before this topic...
<br>
<br>
lotsa love
<br>
