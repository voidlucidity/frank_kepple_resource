<section>
my wanderings through various books led me into the discovery of the obe. i have not had one yet but i have some of the leading upto sensations. one of the main ones is the extremely intense vibrations.
<br>
at first i thought i was having a heart attack, but after reading these same sensations occur to others i am starting to "play" with the vibrations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
if anyone is unsure what these are and if they are having them or not, believe me when i say YOU WILL HAVE NO DOUBTS WHEN THEY DO OCCUR!  at least thats how it is with mine. they used to be centered in my chest but lately they have moved to my head.
<br>
<br>
this is where i need some input........my vibrations are all over but they are extremely intense in my head.........so intense that i have been roused from my meditative state by my teeth chattering.  i am trying to achieve a conscious OBE but all i wind up having is a lucid dream. i kind of skimmed over RB's energy working chapters so i could get the feel of it on my own. did i make a mistake? how close am i to an OBE? (i may have already had one, but i am mixing it up with a lucid dream.)

<section>
You might have been having OBEs and not remembering them, because you were so focused on your vibrations in the here-and-now (get Astral Dynamics to learn about mind-split)
<br>
<br>
I try to relax into my vibrations - - - they feel so much better when I do this.  I just "flop" - - - let all the tension out of every bit of my body.   It doesn't help me OBE so much as it helps me feel better about the side effects, which can be jarring.

<section>
i do have his book and have read about the mind split.
<br>
<br>
maybe i am confused...... i thought the vibrations were a lead up to the obe. i didnt think i could be having an obe while they are affecting my body.i thought they would stop when i separated.
<br>
<br>
but thank you for helping me focus. i will try to concentrate on the possiblility of being in two places at once and try to shift my focus to my other (astral) self.
<br>
<br>
<br>
by the way tisha, that was really cool with your rv stuff under another heading. do you have any books that are really good at teaching this or do you have to pretty much have an inborn ability at it? because i have to admit, those were pretty impressive results.

<br>
I have some experience with the mind split effect. There are times were I was having an obe, but at the same time I was struggling to get out of sleep paralysis (and got quite a few witness). They thought I was having a nightmare. Also sometime I got control of my physical body while at the same time aware of another body at another place. It is a matter of how much focus you're here (or there). I was once frightened by my "obe self" while laying down in sleep paralysis state. At that time my focus were more on my body on the bed but I saw/feel my body having an absent minded obe. I was walking but the manner that the other body seems to avoid my view suggest to me that it was a mind  split effect.
<br>
<br>
I rarely get vibe but when I get them it's very gentle and pleasant buzzing feeling on the whole body. When I get them, I just relaxed into it as Tisha say or to put into another word, I just bathed into them. I don't do anything at all just bathing in it then at some time I would float up effortlessly. In the process of floating I still feel the vibration in the physical body which slowly fade from my notice. I could feel my "obe body" buzz a little bit.
<br>
<br>
I would suggest that you don't worry much about the vibration as they are not really necessary for a projection. Maybe they're there but we just don't notice it. However if you happen to get them it's time to experiments with them. Someone says that if you get the coarse kind you might get stuck so try smoothing them but I don't really know how.

<section>
thank you terry b,
<br>
<br>
yeah thats some good advice. i am going to try to focus on controlling the vibrations. maybe sending them to another part of my body, or trying to control the intensity. i am an electrician by trade and the vibrations feel like i am being electrocuted. i suspect this is giving me a natural barrier to just giving in to the feeling. maybe in the back of my mind i am still equating giving in to the vibrations as giving in to death. but again thank you, and i am going to work with them more.
<br>
<br>
<br>
unless anyone has a quick fix to the intensity level thing? how can i tone them down a notch or five?

There is an energy centre (Chakra) about the centre of the chest. This can give vibrations when ignited and it feels like your physical heart is beating really fast; but it isn't; it just feels that way.

A lucid dream
<u>
 is
</u>
an Astral projection. When you get to this stage, concentrate on getting your level of realisation ability and degree of conscious awareness to at least the same level as you have whilst awake and alert on the Physical.

<br>
Yes, you are mixing it up. The nearest thing to an Astral projection is a lucid dream. When you are lucid dreaming you
<u>
 are
</u>
Astral projecting. Only with a much reduced level of ability to realise the circumstances you are in, and a much reduced level of conscious control.

<section>
thanks frank,
<br>
<br>
but i do seem to have the same level of consciousness except for direct focus. i have had about 7 lucid dreams of flying. i swear it feels like i leave my body behind because i am aware of being able to defy the laws of pysics. i immediately try to fly and sure enough i do. but i get so wrapped up in the awsome feeling that i forget to do the things that i was planning to do. i always try to get "scientific proof that i am out of body, like, i visit my wife to see what she is wearing. then when i wake i will call her to see how accurate i was. i have only been able to focus once to do this though. and i was wrong on the clothes thing. but i did fly to my house. actually i flew half way there and then thought about the instant travel thing and i did that. and sure enough i was there.
<br>
<br>
the funny thing though is the entire time i was in my "home" i kept feeling these intense falling sensations, even though i was in a standing position.i didnt fall downward, but it felt like i was being pulled backward from the way i was facing. it felt like i was falling into another place. i am still stuck on some of my old belief systems and i thought i was being pulled into hell. i know this sounds ridiculus, but thats what was going through my head at the time.
<br>
<br>
are these kind of sensations normal for my beginning efforts?
<br>
<br>
i read somewhere that you cant instantly travel in the real time plane. is this true?
<br>
<br>
i also heard that the falling sensations are the very beginning of separation from your psysical body. if this is so, should i try to give in more to the feeling?
<br>
<br>
thanks for everyones input by the way.
<br>
Frank you seem to have a bunch of knoweledge on these things, anymore input?

Hi guru
<br>
<br>
I suggest that the next time you feel the "falling sensation" you go with it and see what happens.I`ve experienced similar feelings and find it a useful way to move from a marginally aware state to a much more concious
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///projection.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 projection.It
</a>
`s a bit scary at first:kind of reminds me of leaping backwards off a
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///cliff.you" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 cliff.You
</a>
might even call it a leap of faith.The same holds true with the vibrations.I find by making them intensify,not so much by amplitude but by frequency, it improves my level of experience. With a little practice you should be able to lay to rest your fears of "giving in to death" and "being pulled into hell". I like to  believe in a more positive outcome- like meeting my higher self and exploring wondrous realms. I believe your outlook will greatly influence your experience. To surrender is not always a bad thing.
<br>
<br>
Happy Trails

This is typical of what happens where a person gets
<u>
 so
</u>
wrapped up with all the awesome feelings they get carried away by circumstances. Which is why I always advise that, once you find yourself projecting, immediately come to a halt both in body and in mind. Another thing I would advise is not to plan to do all that much beforehand. Travelling to specific places takes quite a high degree of skill and can be very hit and miss for a novice.
<br>
<br>
The sensations you describe are very
<u>
 normal
</u>
. They are scary at first because, for example, with a falling sensation it really does feel exactly like you were falling from a height within the Physical. Plus, all manner of beliefs can get wrapped up in the experience. Thinking you were being pulled into some kind of hell is by no means ridiculous. On the contrary, it is a very
<u>
 natural
</u>
and
<u>
 normal
</u>
thing to think under the circumstances. As such, what tends to happen is your protective sense of awareness kicks in and zaps you out of it.
<br>
<br>
That sensation of movement, at varying speeds in whatever direction, I feel in around 90% of my projections. So rather than think of it as "falling" or being "pulled" and so forth, it might be more useful if you were to think of it as "travelling" instead. Rather than think something like, "Oh sh*t something is pulling me from behind!" Instead just think, "Oh great, off we go then. I wonder where we're going today?" And just let the experience flow. Which I know is a heck of a lot easier to say, than it is to do at the time. But it does come with practice.
<br>
<br>
Your question about real-time zone travel I'm not sure about as virtually all my experiences take place outside this zone.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
strwrs_guru,
<br>
You had some interesting questions on the vibrations in this thread.
<br>
<br>
&gt;maybe i am confused...... i thought the vibrations were a lead up to the obe
<br>
<br>
from my understanding they are a lead up to sleep and quite natural for the sleeping body state. USUALLY the mind sleeps as well and you don't notice. However, they are an indication that your body is asleep and you are obviously aware enough to notice which is the necessary state for projection.
<br>
<br>
My first couple experiences with the vibrational state were quite profound, what I would call large amplitude vibration if you remember your physics. Now however, when I get them I a) try to suppress my excitement because its easy to be anxious and knock yourself right out of the vibrations. b) relax. for me the vibrations become a pleasant hum like sensation with a small amplitude. After about 5 or so projections from this state however, as soon as i feel the onset of the vibrations in my legs (which is where it always starts for me) I focus my attention up and shoot out of my body.
<br>
<br>
Hope that helps
<br>
Wonderboy
