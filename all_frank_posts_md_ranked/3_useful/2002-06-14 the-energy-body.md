im curious...... am meant to concentrate on the energy flowing through my body until i project,  i should i try and forget that i have a body???
<br>
<br>
am i meant to charge my body and chakras with energy, and then focus on an exit tecnique?  because i usually focus on the energy in my body, thinking they will lead me to the vibrations.

You have to decide what it is, exactly, that you want to do. If you concentrate your thought-energy on what Mystics call Chakras then you will tend to experience some weird and wonderful bodily effects, but that tends to be all you feel. Doing this tends to have the effect of giving you evidence of some kind of hidden-energy, and can be quite exciting
<br>
<br>
If you want to experience an obe state, then you have to basically forget about having a physical body. Just completely forget that you have it, and simply let it go. Which is fairly hard to do. Though, provided you do not have any injuries, or whatever, then relaxing from the neck down is the easy part. Relaxing what goes on in the head, both physically and mentally, is the hard part.
<br>
<br>
I have found the Monroe Institute, Gateway series CD (to Focus 10 state - CD1) very helpful in allowing myself to have repetitive, conscious-exit obe's

<section>
thank you frank, but  what do you mean when you say "hidden energy"
<img alt="???" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/huh.png" title="Huh"/>
<br>
do you mean something i can harness, or just that i am discovering the energy body i never knew i had?

<br>
Yes, the latter.
<br>
<br>
I feel all this toying around with Chakra stuff is quite useful in the sense that it gives a person a solid experience of some kind of hidden energy. Like, if you excite your "base Chakra" (well, that's what I think it is called) your legs feel like they are floating away from you and, if you are male, you tend to get a stonking erection.

<br>
<br>
Excite the area around your middle and you get a feeling like your whole lower body just relaxed and opened to some magical force. Allow that sensation to rise upwards and you stimulate what mystics call the Heart Chakra: where it feels like you have swollen to twice your normal size and you get a very pleasant fuzzy feeling.
<br>
<br>
While all this is very interesting and entertaining to the individuals who like that kind of thing... it's not Astral Projection.
<br>
<br>
That's why I say, you must really first choose what it is, exactly, you want to accomplish.

<section>
i see Frank, but i got a few more questions (last ones i promise)
<br>
<br>
the only chakra i have trouble energising is my base chakra, the others i can do fine,  how do you activate yours??
<br>
<br>
and about those  damn erections, whenever i can feel that im about to project, or am close to it,  i ALWAYS get an erection and  then i can forget about projecting that night,  if you have this problem, how do you get around it??

<br>
Quite simply, I don't. Well, not nowadays, I mean. Though I have activated Chakras in the past just to try and understand what it is all about.
<br>
<br>
As for the erection problem, what you may be doing is inadvertently relaxing into some kind of dreamy reverie where the mind starts operating and thinking on a base level. The act of procreation is one of the most basic of human reflexes. So that's why it could be coming up to play, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
Projection entails a state which Robert Monroe ever so aptly describes: as "mind awake, body asleep". The "body asleep" part is the easy bit. Any normal, healthy person can fall asleep quite naturally. The tricky part is keeping the mind awake.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
When I say "mind awake" it is precisely that, fully awake in exactly the same way as if you were bright and alert in the physical. Only you have no feeling of a physical body. Though your mind obviously realises you do have a physical body attached but it is sensed as a kind of blob that is lying below you.
<br>
<br>
The reason why it feels like it is below (or underneath) you is because, at this stage, your sense of conscious awareness is contained at a point about the centre of your forehead. This is the point where you step into the Astral.
<br>
<br>
Any physical-body sensation will totally scupper the whole process, as you are only too aware. What I'd suggest is to try practising keeping your mind more alert. And rather than thoughts of activating Chakras and such like, just think about letting go of the physical-body completely.
<br>

Yours,
<br>
Frank
