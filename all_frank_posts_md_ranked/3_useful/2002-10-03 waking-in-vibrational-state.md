Let me tell you what just happened to me...
<br>
<br>
I decided to meditate and so went and lay down.  As I lay there repeating an affirmation and doing energy raising, I fell asleep.  I remembered my dream which is not unusual in itself as I remember dreams alot.  I was dreaming this time of being inside my closet which is/was a long closet that you can walk inside of.  I was arranging and rearranging my clothes, sliding the hangers up and down the rack and looking for things for my mother to wear..  I was standing on my dressing gown which was in the floor along with a couple of shirts.  I looked down at it in the floor and decided to pick it up.  As I pulled on the corner of my gown, something was pulling it back from me.  I kept tugging and then it dawned on me, I was standing on it.  I moved off of it and then tried to pick it up.  The pulling of my gown continued. I could not pick it up. In my dream, I remember thinking "wow, something is under the clothes pulling my gown".  Suddenly under the carpet, something hunched up and the carpet bubbled and it started moving toward me.  It was like in a horror movie and I was scared in my dream.  Anyway, it reached me and came into me and went right inside my body.  I felt it moving around inside me growling and making odd noises and yanking around inside me and in my dream I decided it could not harm me, so I started laughing at it [still dreaming].  I woke at that point, and as I woke I continued to lay real still in the bed as I was in the vibrational state and hugh sounds and feelings of electricity were moving through my body.  It crackled and growled and moved in waves through my head, back and neck and was marvelous.  I thought "oh my god, I am in the vibrational state".  So, I calmed myself and tried to visualize where I wanted to go.  Alas, it ended....and I didn't go anywhere.
<br>
<br>
I feel this was definate progress...  I FELT THE VIBRATIONAL STATE and it was nothing like what I had previously thought was the vibrational state. This was incredibly loud and very electrical and like I said, was mostly in my neck and back and head area. Or at least in those areas it was the most pronounced. It was extremely loud.. There was absolutely NO mistaking it for what it was.  I can see how this would scare someone who was not prepared for it.  Now, since I have heard this and felt this tremendous energy, somehow I feel it will be easier to achieve the vibrational state again.  I will anyway recognize it for what it is.  The little buzzing sounds I experienced during my "blueOBE" were nothing like this..  This was LOUD and like I said, very electrical.. I don't recall paralysis, but it could have been there.  I made a point NOT to move so I am not real sure about that.
<br>
<br>
I would apprecitate any feedback from Frank and his thoughts on this... or anyone else who is knowledgeable.  Has anyone else ever woke in the vibrational state?
<br>
<br>
My main problem with it was when I woke and realized I was in the vibrational state I went blank inspite of all my reading on as what to do when this occurs.  I have read to consciously try to increase the vibrations.  I have on the other hand read to ignore the vibrations.  And these uncertainties are probably what stopped me from completing a separation process...  This is what I need help on...
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any feedback.

I also have wakened in the vibrating state-it can be intense or mild. My general pattern has been to do techniques, fall asleep and be awakened by vibrations later and then project sometimes. At the time you are in the vibe state you should be able to do quick technique or open your astral sight and exit right away. Sometimes you may feel like parts of you are floating free and other parts are stuck. Did you hear anything or start to see lights, visions or hypnogogic imagery?I am still trying to have good astral sight, but I get lots of sounds-usually my kids are in the other room talking-I have learned to ignore them. The other thing that can get you is things grabbing at you or weird things watching. RB says to ignore this phenomina, it is harmless. I think by reading, studying and trying you can program your conciousness to   react in the 'right' way to watever is going on.

I'm a total ammature but dont make my mistake of trying to control everything.  Have some idea of what you would like to do in the event of an OBE but when you get the vibrations just relax and fall back into it.  It's a reflex when you get that far.
<br>
<br>
Are you keeping up with the workbook?  I stuck a card on the window sometime last week but haven't attempted  to Astral view it yet.

I didn't notice any lights or anything like that..  Nothing was visual.  It was all auditory and feelings of electricity for lack of a better description.  I looked in my book today and tried to find something about waking in a vibe state.  I couldn't find anything.  Ralphm, your mail has given me pointers in the right direction.  Thanks, and I will try to do some reading tonight..
<br>
<br>
Tia and the workbook:  I had to take a short break from it due to extended illness in our family and time has been very pressed.  After this week I can get back in the swing of things with the workbook..  It is wonderful, is it not?? It is so organized.  Sometimes I implement my own ideas with those of the workbook, such as my own affirmations repeated daily or just a slight alteration of what is suggested.  That way it feels more personal and hopefully will work better for me.

Blossom: what you describe is very normal. It's just your Crown Chakra switching on (has happened to me countless times). Problem is, when you come across it after waking up from sleep, as you did, the vibrations - coupled with the other feelings of electricity and crackling and so forth - have reached a fairly advanced and intense stage. Which makes it all feel like it's out of control.
<br>
<br>
However, when you do this while conscious, the vibrations begin with a very light mental wafting. Like, someone is stroking the inside top of your brain with a large leaf about every second or two. At which point you can take control of the process and allow the vibrations to build to a higher pitched more of a light buzzing sensation.
<br>
<br>
Then, for a bit of a laugh, direct the energy to your chest centre and ignite the Chakra there. As it comes alive, you should get the feeling like you just dropped about 300 ft in about a second. Now block the energy flow, come back up and repeat. It's immense fun.

Hi Jenn,
<br>
<br>
Waking up in the vibrational state is how I acheive a lot of my projections at this stage. I find I can just step, roll, sit, float, shoot out from there...

MEG, do you find that often you just wake up in the middle of the night with the astral vibrations going on?
<br>
<br>
That is what usually hapens with me, then I take it from there!

<section>
Thanks Frank and everyone..  Due to yesterday's episode, I was pretty excited by the prospect of energy raising today and meditating again today..  It was totally different but some more odd things happened.  By odd, I only mean something I have not experienced before.
<br>
<br>
I lay down prone, which is customary for me, and began.. This was a healing exercise and so I began to enter my trance by alternating climbing my rope and visualizing myself in some other environment and using the bounce technique.  I would do each for 5 or 10 minutes and then move to something else.  After 30-40 minutes of this, my head started feeling intense intense pressure..  Like maybe something mashed on it ... It was a very marked feeling.  My eyes began aching slightly but that was not a constant pain. It came and went for only seconds at a time. They just ached on and off.   During the same time as my eye aches, I saw flashing lights that were extremely bright but this only was only flashing.  In between the flashing, I felt like I was in the center of a very dark void or a room that was empty of any light at all.  I absolutely enjoyed this...  The pressure on my head remained during all of this..  Time went by ...  probably 45 more minutes or so..  As I concentrated on the subject of my healing, the pressure of my head and the void deepened and my body felt like it was NOT floating up, but more blowing up as in a blowing up a balloon.  I felt like a balloon inside my body.  From head to toe.  As this feeling was at it's most intense with the head pressure still there, I opened my eyes and lay there and looked at the ceiling.  It was incredible.  The feelings did not leave.  I lay there awake looking around my room.  This was not astral sight.  I opened my physical eyes and nothing changed as far as my balloon body or head pressure..  It all remained..  It was just awsome..  I lay with my eyes open for perhaps 5 minutes and then closed them again and experienced waves of energy.  I did not leave my body..  I guess it's just not ready to happen, but I feel I am on the verge...      But even without leaving my body, the experience was enjoyable and filled with learning for me..  I could feel my chakras opening from the heart down and including my heart.  I did not notice my throat chakra at all.  But the head thing was incredible.  When it was over, I got out my copy of AD and read about this head pressure thingy.  I guess my dormant crown chakra or possibly the one in my forehead was opening which is also consistant with what Frank told me about yesterday's experience... And the lights are consistant with ralphm's post..  I am so glad I remained awake for this...
<br>
<br>
I am having some sort of breakthough with my meditation and I feel so fortunate to be able to achieve what I can now.  All the last year during practice and practice, it is finally coming together a little..  I am thankful I did not give up..  I always felt like I was a breath away and now I feel the same so I was probably further than I thought at first.
<br>
<br>
One other thing.  A major problem for me is a quiet mind.  My mind thinks constantly about something.  Even during all of this and my successes.  This started out today as a healing mission and then ended the way I described above.  I am not sure what that means but something is happening.  I hope it is with them.. I don't know if it was wishful thinking but at times during this it was almost like I could see a face..  Probably wishful thinking...
<br>
<br>
Again sincerely,
<br>

Hi Jenn,
<br>
<br>
The feeling of being in a void with your head expanding is
<i>
 very
</i>
familiar to me. Either you feel like you are expanding, or the void is expanding. It is a comfortabe feeling. I've had it a couple of times when I've laid in bed somewhat exhausted, but my mind is still in top gear, and I have managed to deliberately get to that state during meditation.
<br>
<br>
Frank has mentioned some things about this state, I think in his post Gateway Wave1...
<br>
<br>
Definitely something to work on.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
James.

<section>
Hello James S,
<br>
<br>
I guess in a moment I will head over to Gateway waves and check it out..  I have heard from someone that it was a good thread!  I am glad someone else has experienced the swollen thing..  I have had this happen twice today..  My poor little husband asks me.."oh, are we going on another trip or just buying a ticket?"  He doesn't mind me meditating really... In fact he is quite understanding of my need to explore the mystical/spirtual or metaphysical aspect of life even though he is a catholic.  He is just sarcastic by nature..
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Jenn

Douglas - Yeah. I've noticed it's usually about an hour to 90 mins after I first fall asleep. But it's a spontaneous thing that has "just happened" about once or twice a week since I was a teenager (with high and low spots of course) - though having the intention to project and an understanding of the process helps, these days. I didn't even know what it was until a couple of years back.
