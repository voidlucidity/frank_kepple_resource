<section>
this is obviously a  very long post but the experience i had last week was incredible, and i very much would like some light shed on it if possible. i was dreaming and awoke but didnt move to find that i couldnt move anyway because i had some paralysis. it wasnt a big deal to me because i have read astral dynamics along w/ some lucid dreaming books. i actually kind of like the parlysis and it's happened to me a few times before so i don't believe that i was afraid at all. i'm lying there realizing i was just dreaming and i start to use a technique called "dream spinning" which i found otu about in one of the books that i've used before to spin me back into a lucid dream. i was having some diffuculty dong it right because it's a mental action and i was incorporating my physical body along w/ it the slightest bit which will void it's effects. i have my eyes closed and i feel something touching my legs.  i strained to turn my head to get a look and i saw waht looked like handmarks indented into my legs, and they appeared to be massaging me. i was a little perplexed and there may have been an initial shock of fear or something but i remained calm during the entire episode. the hands continued to rub my legs upward until they reached about where my crotch was. at this point i tried to break the paralysis and moved my lower body slightly. the invisble hands stopped moving where they were and i could still feel pressure where they stopped. there came a dreamy girl voice that was drawn out w/ a kind of echo to it that said "it's ok".  i was slightly sleepy still and i thought that the voice said "it's Kaye". Kaye is a friend of mine. i dont recall if she has ever massaged my legs or not,  there may have been some back massaging once or twice, but i'm not sure about the legs. so i replied "Kaye?" and at the same instant i realized that the voice said "it's ok".  the voice came again only this time it definetly said "yeah it's Kaye". at this point i assume this is all coming from my subconscious so  i decide to ck . i asked the voice for Kaye's middle and last name. the last name came back correct and i had already known it. the middle name i did not know and when i asked for that the hands went away along w/ the voice. still paralyzed i decide to try to spin back to dream agian when i feel pressure on the left side of my neck. i m lying on my right side and i see out of my peripheal that i have another head on my neck facing backwards. same haircut , same everything. i gain some more movement and i reach out w/ my arm to touch it's neck and i can feel it as if it were my own. i also can control the movment like it was a part of me. it speaks and asks me for my hand. i dont want to seem afraid and have some fear start to snowball and turn this into a bad experience so i reluctantly reach around and put my hand in front  of the face while saying "ok, but if you bite me..." and it says to me "what are you talking about, have you been really paranoid lately or something?" in kind of a mocking friendly voice and at the same time my hand starts getting a masssage from a pair of hands that i can not see.  i say "no, this is just so different". it replies "different?" and i say " yes i just dont recall ever doing this before". i was careful not to say that i have never done anything like this before because i was a little scared now and didnt want to make any definite statements that could be false. at this point it faded away and the paralysis broke. i awoke and recorded it. the night before i was doing some evergy devlopment and was trying for an oobe. i fell into the trance state for a while and decided that i tried enough for the night and went to sleep. everything that happened seemed just as real as my waking life does, but i still feel wierd posting this because it's so crazy and i've never experienced aything like this before and if someone were to tell me this  story i would sigh and shake my head at them. any help would be appreciated and if you've read this far you deserve a medal. again, sorry about the long post.

What is happening is you are learning to increase your level of awareness to a high degree. What tells me, is at the end where you say the experience was as real to you as your normal waking life. That is what Astral-travel proper is like.
<br>
<br>
When you can succeeed in doing a fully controlled, conscious-exit projection to the Astral proper
<i>
 and maintain emotionally closed
</i>
what you experience is just as "real" as if you were experiencing it on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Reading through your post it is obvious that what you have yet to learn, is how to remain emotionally closed.
<br>
<br>
What you experienced, was what I call a "buffer experience" where your surroundings are part Astral and partly formed from your own emotional release. Thought is a primary energy and thought-fuelled emotion, released on the Astral, literally creates the circumstances that surround you.
<br>
<br>
So if you are mildly fearful, for example, you will instantly find yourself in a mildly fearful circumstance. Problem is, if you don't realise this, what you tend to do is get ever more fearful. So you release even more emotion which has the effect of fuelling ever more scary circumstances. Normally, it all starts to spiral out of control and ends in a forced awakening back to the Physical.
<br>
<br>
Buffer experiences are very common. Especially those concerning fear and sex. However, as they normally happen with next to no sense of awareness, the experience is barely remembered: just a few fleeting memories, which very quickly fade on awakening from sleep.
<br>
<br>
Problems can occur, though, with beginners who suddenly find themselves on the Astral with a high degree of awareness. I used to get this all the time in my beginning years of projection. You get into situations where you have a high degree of conscious awareness, but with very little control. Which can be mighty confusing.
<br>
<br>
The solution, which unfortunately took me just over 5 years to realise, is to learn how to remain emotionally closed. I found the best most productive state of mind to have, was to maintain an air of mild curiosity. It's one of those things that is very easy to say, but mighty tricky to do
<i>
 at the time
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
As with a lot of things Astral, the solution to this is practise as often as you can. If you find yourself getting out of your depth, rather than have the situation spiral out of control, try and project back to the Physical. There you can take a few deep breaths, calm down, and project again.
<br>

Yours,
