<section>
Hi all, i had a strange encounter the other night i'd like to share. First off i'd like to say i've never been in the astral but have experienced lots of sleep paralysis for about 8 years now.
<br>
<br>
Ok, so i was sleeping and suddenly could feel the falling down spinning feeling i get when i know i'll awaken in paralysis, so i ride it out cause it feels great. Next thing i know there i am paralyzed lying on the left side of my body and out the corner of my eye i see a creature sitting on my shoulder, it was small, maybe 1 1/2 - 2 feet high. I couldn't see the head because of the position i was in but could see that the body was dark brown or black and i think it had fur. It sorta reminded me of a skinny Ewok. (From Star Wars if anyone doesn't know)
<br>
<br>
I struggled to get out of paralysis because i was a bit frantic, but when i couldn't break out of it i snapped and yelled at it "*UCK YOU". It then got up and walked out of my sight round to the back of my head, that's when i felt the tickling on the back of my neck start. This went on for about 10 seconds and then i snapped out of it back to reality.
<br>
<br>
Has anyone encountered such a creature or have any idea what it was?

Can't say I've seen such a creature, but something you said reminded me of a recent experience.
<br>
Just a few days ago I had woke early in the morning and drifted back to sleep. As I fell asleep, I felt this tingling sensation 'wrap' around the back of my neck. It felt like a surge of energy sweeping upwards towards the base of my skull. Not unpleasant but I sensed someone else was cuasing it. This lasted a few moments then I was yanked from body and deposited clear across the house. I was pulled from the same area the energy sensation was felt. It was highly unusual. What resulted was the most lucid dream I have had in a very long while. I never before thought so clearly in a dream nor had the lucidity last for so long.
<br>
<br>
Was the "tickling" at the back of your neck something you normally experience or was it unique with this occurance?

I had a similar experience 7 years ago. However it looked more like an ugly kind of creature, than an ewok. It was floating above my legs, staring at me, mischievously. As I lay there paralysed, it put the stump of its arm (it was missing a hand !) against my forehead, &amp; a very unpleasant sensation travelled through me.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what it was, I was just glad to wake up !

When people begin to focus their awareness away from the physical they can come across all manner of thought forms which represent emotions of one particular mix or another. Many people when projecting for the first time experience the phenomenon of meeting their own emotions (usually a mix of fear) head on.
<br>
<br>
You are beginning to enter realms of existence where thought equals action. Within the physical we get used to basically being able to think what we like and not have our physical surroundings chopping and changing to suit. Such is not the case within the non-physical.
<br>
<br>
Within the non-physical, thoughts can literally take on a life of their own. To the extent where, say a person creates a fragment of themselves representing a particular fear, you can get situations where the fragment seeks to perpetuate its existence by behaving in such a way as to bring out that same fear from the person who gave it "life" in the first place.
<br>
<br>
Beginners projecting for the first time tend to quickly reach a point where their beliefs are not supported by their experiences. At which point, in an effort to try and make sense of what is happening, they try to mould the experience to fit their beliefs. In doing so, because of the basic nature of the non-physical environment, i.e as you think so it becomes, they quickly become engaged in what is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which is, in a nutshell, where all the "negs" came from.

No i've never felt tickling before whilst in paralysis, i get the feeling it was IT that was tickling me as it started when it went behind my head out of view. I can't say if it was ugly or not as i couldn't see the head, only the body. It was just the little body that reminded me of an ewok.
<br>
<br>
I think if i see IT again i won't yell at it, maybe i'll tell him i love him and see what happens.

Not all beings you encounter that way are figments of your fears or dreams taking form. The astral world has many beings in it just like our world does. I met a creature like that once but he had bat wings and was the size of a cat. It was like a tiny gargoyle. It was on my shoulder the same way. He made my energy feel quite uncomfortable and I had to force myself awake. I wasn't out of my body but I was seeing the astral world which sometimes happens to me in the early am. Once when I was a early teen in the 1976 I saw an astral thunder-bird that way.

 <br>
 Archnea: Hello and welcome to the forum.
 <br>
 <br>
 Of course, not every creature you meet are figments of fear and whatnot. There's an incredible variety of wildlife I, for one, take great pleasure in being amongst. The wood nymphs are my favourite and I'm enraptured by the sound they make. Telemann's concerto for flute, I believe, was composed in a way to mimic the sound and the behaviour of the wood nymphs - because it is just
 <u>
  so
 </u>
 like them it simply cannot be mere coincidence.
 <br>
 <br>
 The situation I was talking about in my original post was when a person is new to projection. Unfortunately, they often meet their fears head on. Problem is they are entering a realm where thought equals action, so emotions can easily take on a life of their own. It is one thing reading about this effect on a forum such as this one, and it is quite another thing actually experiencing it. It's far easier said than dealt with!
 <br>
 <br>
 These kinds of "creatures" newcomers often meet are formed from the projection of their own fears. It would be stretching the narrative to say they have a consciousness of their own. But they do have, like all creatures, a basic instinct for survival.
 <br>
 <br>
 Because the creature's very existence, then, depends on the person's projection of fear, it could do nothing but attack that person in order to protect the only semblance of identity it had. It's quite sad, really, when you think of it, that poor creature struggling to survive in the only way it knows how. But people hardly ever see it that way.
 <br>
 <br>
 Yours,
 <br>
 Frank
