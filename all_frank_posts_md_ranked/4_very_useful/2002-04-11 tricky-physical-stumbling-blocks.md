<section>
<br>
From my interaction with this BBS thus far, it appears people have a big problem with learning how to project controllably. However, learning how to project with a degree of reliability, in relative terms, is an easy task when compared to the *major* pitfalls beginners face once they are "out there".
<br>
<br>
The one BIG pitfall is failure to control emotions. As I explained in another post, on the physical we can get a bit uptight over things now and again without doing any real harm. But the key factors here are "bit" and "now and again".
<br>
<br>
If you are a person who gets emotional over matters that typically happen on the Physical plane, believe me, you are going to last not one second on the Astral.
<br>
<br>
The reason for this emotional stumbling block is due to the fact that the sense of conscious awareness you take with you to the Astral, is
<u>
 exactly
</u>
the same as the sense of consciousness you have on the Physical.
<br>
<br>
But the opposite is also the case. In that, the sense of conscious awareness you
<i>
 bring back
</i>
to the physical is the same too. Which can be a very
<i>
 positive
</i>
thing. As it basically makes the whole process of "enlightenment" possible. Something which does have a profoundly positive effect on your Physical life.
<br>
<br>
However, the BIG potential danger, is that negative Astral experiences can have a profoundly negative affect on your Physical life. In the sense that there are only so many "Demons" the mind can take before it can quite possibly begin to feel possessed.
<br>
<br>
But on the Astral, please understand there truly is no "evil"... only a person's lack of perception. The same basic rules apply on the Physical plane too. But they are nowhere near as obvious.
<br>
<br>
Another big stumbling block is: not only can you see vile and/or other immensly scary images, you can get immensly scary "feelings" too. When I say feelings, I mean feelings like "beings" were pressed against you and/or latching onto your body. Beings that you cannot, for the life of you, shake off. One example of this happens to me now and again. It took me about a year to fathom what it was.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, if I am feeling a bit drained physically. Like, if I have been lifting and carrying things so my muscles ache a little in the morning: when the vibrations come about, rather than them building in intensity to the point where I project, the projection process might suddenly "lock".
<br>
<br>
Immediately they do so, I get a strong feeling like some large "thing" has latched onto my back and is pressing itself against my skin. My conscious mind is desperate to "shake it off" but physically I am completely unable to move.
<br>
<br>
The reason why this happens, is because even though what I call my "mental" side of things is preparing to project, my sense of conscious awareness isn't really going for it. Often, even though I might be tired, the vibrations will begin. But I think, "No, I'm too tired this morning" and I'll roll over onto my side. At which point the pre-projection vibrations slowly die off, and that is that.
<br>
<br>
But, now and again, the vibrations will suddenly stop mid-projection. At which point, my sense of conscious awareness has left my physical body, but the vibrations suddenly halted before projection to the Astral took place. Here, it seems, my sense of conscious awareness is "hung" or "frozen" in a kind of no-man's-land between my Physical body and my Astral body.
<br>
<br>
In this situation, I am lying on my bed and fully able to think: but have no awareness of the Astral; cannot move in the Physical; and my consciousness wants to "panic" because it feels like this huge "thing" is attached to my back. The first few times it happened were VERY scary. However, once you've experienced it a few times, it becomes much easier to live through.
<br>
<br>
The solution is to try and simply go to sleep. Which is extremely difficult, at first, because you would bet your life there was this huge sucker-monster behind you!
<br>
<br>
This morning, the effect I have just described, happened to me again.
<br>
<br>
Unable to move I drifted off into a Lucid dream. I was in a bar and had ordered a drink. They served me only a small glass of beer even though I'd ordered a large one. An argument ensued. Next there was a fight and someone jumped on my back (surprise surprise!) and I kept spinning around trying to shake them off. Eventually I broke free. (Which I guess is the point where my conscious awareness slipped back into the Physical.)
<br>
<br>
The argument had introduced an element of aggression, the scenery changed, and I found myself fighting with a group of riflemen. Which wasn't all that pleasant. But I thought I'd run with it and slowly let the energy dissipate. Thinking of how I could help these guys in a more positive way, I suddenly became the cook (in the Physical I very much enjoy preparing food).
<br>
<br>
Now I was standing in front of a large cooking range behind a glass screen. The men were still fighting outside and it was my job to prepare a hearty meal for them when they returned. A few of the guys turned around and beckoned me to come and shoot. But I had some good food ready and they were hungry. Word soon spread, and they put down their rifles, came inside, and sat down to eat. At which point the scenery melted away as it's energy ran out.
<br>
<br>
Also, it's probably fitting to mention here that I feel it is important that you allow stray emotional energy to dissipate naturally, if at all possible. That way you end your experiences on a more positive note.
<br>
<br>
I got this idea from my working with young horses. I found that no matter what went wrong during a schooling session, if you end the session on a positive note the horse makes faster long-term progress. And the same appears to be true with a lot of things in life.
<br>

Frank-
<br>
<br>
Thank you for sharing that personal experience.  I find info. like that to be invaluable.  I too have had experiences strikingly similar and I always find that in my waking, "physical" consciousness there is something negative going on.  For example when I fight with my fiance or get angry while driving my car...these emotions spill over into my dreams and OBE's.  Many times the demons we face are created by ourselves and they are also sometimes the hardest to shake off, literally...  I don't know if that's where you were going with your post, but that's where it led me.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again-
<br>
Daniel

   Your post reminds me of the strangest dream I had a while back, I thought it was an OBE that I was remembering as it wasn't the usual dream feeling.  I think that things do jump on your back, not just related to the physical body.  Anyway, in the dream I was in the lower realms and I was wanting to know why I was there.  It was all dark and oppressive.  I was then shown a book, I only remember seeing lines on the page but I know that I understood what I was being shown.  I was attracted in some way to these levels and was being shown why.  After my 'lesson' I suddenly realised I didn't have to be there anymore and proceeded to move up and out of there.  Just then, something jumped on my back.  I wasn't scared initialy, I began to vibrate very fast to dislodge it.  It didn't budge.  I then got scared - infact I panicked.  I shot upwards very fast and at the same time reached behind me and pulled this thing off and ripped it's head off.  It was a reflex movement done out of panic.  I then looked down from a great height at what was left of this 'thing', floating, lifeless, in two seperate bits of energy.

   I think I've had things jump on my back before.

 What you recall, to me, is a typical training-ground experience. You were probably projected within the Astral somewhere but your Astral experience would have been heavily buffered by your own emotive imagery. As for killing someone, yes, you can experience ANYTHING on the Astral. That's the marvellous, mind-blowing joy and the big, big *danger* of the Astral. But you cannot kill anyone in the sense that we know it in the Physical, of course.

Hi Frank,
<br>
I'm new to this forum and up until now I thought I hadn't had any OBE's or A/P experiences.  After reading about other's experiences I think I've had quite a few, and just thought they were dreams. I'd like your explanation on a couple of dreams or whatever they were.   I'll refer to them as dreams for now.
<br>
Both of these dreams took place in the middle of the day while napping.  The first one happened when I was pregnant.  I thought I had woken up by the sound of someone knocking on my front door.  I tried to get up to answer the door but I was absolutely paralyzed.  I was struck with fear and I could hear someone entering my house.  I tried and tried to move but couldn't.  Some how I knew that the person who had come into my house had a gun and was coming closer and closer.  Somehow I managed to snap out of it.
<br>
In the other dream I was sleeping on the sofa and again someone came into my house and was walking back and forth in front of me.  I thought I was awake, but I couldn't move.  What is going on, and why are these experiences so nightmarish?  What should I do if it happens again?
<br>
<br>
Debbie

Just some musing:
<br>
Well, I think of the "astral" planes, aka the lower, mental planes as does Frank, as a sort of training ground.  It's like God is saying to our mind and spirit: "Ok, now you can do anything...you can live out any fantasy no matter how twisted, evil, beautiful, etc."  Then it's up to us to shed the carnal passions and desires and ascend up the ladder...I am sure that there are those projectors and even departed spirits who can't get passed this stage for a long time because, like RA Monroe talks about, some would simply seek to fulfill sexual desires, for example, for who know how long.  It's those individuals who move on past these lower planes who will continue to progress with the help of other entities, positive entities, as well as their own higher self.  Anyway, this is just my thought as I read this.
<br>
