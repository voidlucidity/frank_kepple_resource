<section>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I posted this in response to a post on another thread. But have posted it again here as a number of people have mentioned about this before i.e. where people have been distracted by having some tune keep repeating in their mind. So felt it might be worthy of its own thread.
<br>
<br>
This morning I happened to come awake with a song in my head.
<br>
<br>
I had been pottering about in my workshop the previous day repairing my nephew's car, and I'd had the radio on. There was a particular song that kept playing and it got to be a bit annoying. I actually switched the radio off because of it. Anyhow, this morning it was still in my head.
<br>
<br>
As a number of people have posted about having the same problem I thought, hmm, I wonder if it would be possible to use this rather annoying situation advantageously in some way.
<br>
<br>
So I focused on the tune and, what was happening, this chorus-line kept repeating. The main instrument was a piano together with a voice. I don't even know what the tune is called (I'll try and find out) but it has this catchy piano bit that keeps repeating. Anyhow, rather than try and shut it out, I began to concentrate more and more on this repeating piano. As I did so, the voice part faded into the background to the point where only the piano notes remained.
<br>
 <br>
 Next I started slowing down the sequence of notes, ever more gradually to the point where I was taking just one note at a time. As I was doing this, I also gradually increased the length of each note so each one would last a about a second or two (note lengths vary naturally, so increased them all in proportion to what they were originally). I concentrated on feeling each note and tried to make them as real, i.e. as lifelike, as possible in my mind.
 <br>
 <br>
 Well, I think I hit on something here, because after only about 10 minutes of this I found myself stepping into 3D blackness!
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>

Frank,
<br>
<br>
This is fascinating, especially where you say you concentrated on feeling each note....and tried to make them as real---as lifelike as possible. Do you mean focusing your attention on them to the point where there was nothing else in your mind or your awareness but each note? Makes me wonder if this is what ancient people were doing with certain sounds (to preoccupy the brain in order to be able to move into  the nonphysical), such as a drum beat or the vibrational sounds from running a smooth piece of wood around the rim of a crystal bowl.
<br>
<br>
How's it going with being in the 3D blackness? I'm still getting use to it but boy I've got to admit I love what one can do there!
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>

<br>
Brilliant observation!
<br>
<br>
I think you are absolutely correct about this. Dancing, singing, chanting and of course drumming have all been used by ancient (and some modern) cultures to induce inner/higher experiences. Many pagan groups use dancing and chanting to induce a state of trance even in modern society.
<br>
<br>
It all comes down to moving ones senses, and therefore ones conscious awareness away from the physical and to the Astral, and it seems that this can be accomplished by focussing on any of the mundane five senses.
<br>
<br>
Some cultures, e.g. in Tibet, use chanting in conjunction with a repetitive mantra to induce a sort of hemi-synch effect as well. The famous chant of "Om" is one example, and Tibetan Buddhists also chant "Om Mani Padme Hum".
<br>
<br>
Instead of a tune, it might be very interesting to focus on the word "Om" or "AUM", which in fact is a highly sacred word indeed!  Quote "The vibration produced by chanting Om in the physical universe corresponds to the original vibration that first arose at the time of creation. The sound of Om is also called Pranava, meaning that it sustains life and runs through Prana or breath. Om also represents the four states of the Supreme Being. The three sounds in Om represent the waking, dream and deep sleep states and the silence which surrounds Om represents the "Turiya" state".
<br>
<br>
It seems that phasing indeed encompasses, or even is in actuality, the basis of some very ancient practices. I am personally very sure that the Astral projection carried out by almost all ancient cultures is phasing, and not popular OBE as it has become known today.
<br>
<br>
A Happy and Peaceful New Year to everyone!
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Ginny: Yes, exactly that. I didn't have to think about creating some kind of sound as it was already there in my head. So I just concentrated on it more and more to the point where my whole awareness was focussed on this series of notes; that just kept repeating, getting ever slower, and the notes were getting longer. Then, as I say, I just plopped into the 3D blackness. Took me a little by surprise too as I never expected it. All I was doing was toying with the notes.
<br>
<br>
Adrian: Thank you for your input. What you say sounds interesting (forgive the pun!). Problem is, a lot of what you say goes right over my head as I have never really studied the mystical side of things. When you say focus on the word "om" I was wondering please if you could you expand on that for me a little more. Like, do you just picture the word, or say it out loud, or hum it in your head, or what? Sorry if what I'm asking sounds a tad simplistic. Also, if there's a website you know of that explains it in fairly simple terms I'd be grateful for the link.
<br>

Jeni: you are very welcome. I hope it will be of help.

Thank you for asking. Things are going alright for me (which always makes me a tad suspicious!). The 3D blackness is the first state where thought=direct action. So, technically, from that state you should be able to launch yourself basically anywhere. I used to spend a lot of time in this state, just drifting and listening to music (I mean music coming from within) and it's also where I first met Harath.

Frank,

<br>
What I find so interesting here is that you said you not only focused your attention on the inner melody and each note (you must have a long attention span!) but you were also feeling each note. I'm still learning how to use the *remembering the feel* technique, of any given afterlife place/person I've visited before...but when I do, bingo, I'm There.  This has also worked in getting to the 3D blackness.
<br>
<br>
What you've done is so cool because you didn't need any kind of actual vibratory noise to go into the state you went into: your brain already had the 'notes' and you just focused on them, felt them. Wow!
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>

Adrian,
<br>
<br>
Yes...and thank you for expanding on this so I could understand more fully what the heck I was trying to get at!---LOL!
<br>
<br>
Years ago I went to a gathering of people interested in spiritual discussion to initially listen to two Tibetan Buddists Lamas talk about their religion. Although I have held such respect and love for the Dali Lama and the Tibetans, as well as their religion...joining any religious order just hasn't been in the cards for me this time around. After their short talk explaining their religious beliefs Lama Inga led the group in a chant...and it was within minutes that I was struggling to remain conscious. I felt such a total peacefulness. Next thing I knew I was a male, standing on a hill, wrapped in some kind of cloth robe or garment, holding what I guess was a walking stick. I could feel the cold wind on me, see a great distance over treeless, green hills. I wasn't watching this person...I was this person. And then I woke up, back in the small lecture hall, leaning over so far I was almost resting on my neighbors shoulder...and embarrassed. Later during coffee the lama approached and said I had an experience during the chanting. Some part of my 'greater me' remembered something....because of the chanting I guess. And there was a low frequency in the chanting, a steady low hum that if I to this day started listening to, while say driving, would no doubt drive into a ditch or something.
<br>
<br>
It seems as if our minds as well as our bodies are fine-tuned for nonphysical adventure!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy New Year Adrian...let's hope it'll be a peaceful one too.
<br>
<br>
Much love,

Ginny: I think this is what Monroe developed when he talks of his "quick switch" method. I think he found that all he had to do was think about being There, and so he became.
<br>
<br>
I have been experimenting with a quick-switch method of getting into the 3D blackness (which I normally always see with a starscape in the background). What I've been doing is just laying down and imagining that I was already at the 3D blackness stage. The keyword here, I found, was "already". In the sense of I'm not concerned at all with wondering whether I'm nearly there; whether it's going to work; whether it's going to take me 2 minutes or 10 minutes; etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
I feel strongly that if a person could just imagine, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they were within the 3D blackness; if they could just lay back and picture themselves
<i>
 already
</i>
there. Then that is all it would take to instantly place them there. I suppose people would still have to work on getting there using more conventional means, at first. As making a quick-switch requires you to be very familiar with the feeling of whatever state it is you are switching to.
<br>
<br>
I can't actually make the switch all that quickly yet. But the results I have been getting thus far have been encouraging.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Greetings Ginny!
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much indeed for relating your Tibbetan experience! I am quite sure that the chant that to listened to caused a spontaneous altered state as indeed it is probably intended to. The chant has probably been in their order for hundreds if not thousands of years.
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean about religion. I am not religious, and never have been, but many so called religions,  most certainly have a very high level of understanding about at least some aspects of the higher/inner realities, Spiritual matters, and what they all mean. Among these, the Tibbetan monks are very advanced in this respect, as are the Hindu religions, and we are indebted to them for showing us the way in many areas.  The very greatest centre of the highest wisdom and knowledge is of course Egypt.
<br>
<br>
Regarding religion generally, we should respect peoples rights to subscribe to any religion that they need to, if it helps them through life in some way, and at the same time we should certainly never fear being caught up in the creed and dogma that surrounds them, for want of learning what they have to offer - and the Tibbetans have a great deal to offer without doubt, as do Buddhists generally - it does not mean that we necessarily have to become one in order to benefit.
<br>
<br>
<br>
And Frank,

As always you have identified something extremely important
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; Due to the power of the mind in the higher spheres, intent and imagination are extremely powerful attributes. One important basis of Magic is to apply the power of the mind and will in such as way as to be certain that your intent has already come to pass accordingly. This not only applies to phasing, but in many things that obey universal laws.
<br>
<br>
I have to say that this forum, thanks to its excellent participants, is producing a great many very useful facts and realities from which we all can learn.
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your contributions, and once again a very Happy and Peaceful Year to everyone.

  Hi Adrian,
  <br>
  <br>
  Yes, I do. I've always understood that we each have our own path. I have no doubt I've lived through many religions, in a great many lives. Each life we live, with its religious or even nonreligious beliefs, is a fascianting experience in its own right.

<section>
Thanks Frank,
<br>
I never really thought about it, however, there have been a couple times when I've had a song in my head, and used it to project or to have a lucid dream (which was my former intention with such things) Instead of slowing it down, or letting it drive me nuts, I would try to make the whole thing sound like an orchestra. I would try really try to hear the whole song and not just the refrain and after a few minutes it would start playing, and playing quite loudly in my head. At that point I was only a hop skip and a jump to my altered state.  Since I don't listen to music much its not really been an issue, but now I'm thinking about trying it tonight. (although, I'll have to intentionally stick a song in my head) maybe this technique could help some people, particularly musically oriented people.
<br>
Take care,
<br>
Wonderboy

<section>
Greetings Wonderboy!
<br>
<br>
Thanks very much indeed for that perspective.
<br>
<br>
I have been considering the similarities between achieving phasing states by means of mind imagery or sight on the one hand - the original methdology behind phasing - and by means of mind sounds on the other. In the case of imagery, one focusses on a scene or a sequence, and endeavours to make them as real as possible, and so it completely occupies the mind and higher/inner senses thereby excluding the mundane physical senses. Your idea of taking a basic song, and turning into a whole orchestra is the same concept but using a different sense.
<br>
<br>
I am sure it would be possible to do the same with the Astral sense of smell - e.g., an imaginery walk around a summer garden using the smell only, smelling the roses and all other fragrant flowers to create the whole sensation.
<br>
<br>
It seems to be all about focussing so intensely on the inner senses, that it completely blocks out the outer mundane senses, and then everything else simply follows.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.
