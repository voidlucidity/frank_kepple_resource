<section>
I've been trying to obe for a couple months and I haven't been able to. I have some questions.
<br>
<br>
Should the lights be on or off? I always turn them off cause it seems like a distraction, but then I fall asleep.
<br>
<br>
Could I OBE with covers over my body? I always try in bed before going to sleep. I'm also wondering if maybe I should try at different times.
<br>
<br>
Last question.. am I trying too hard? some people that have their first obe say that they have been working hard for a while and when they did it they weren't as careful, not trying to do everything EXACT. Maybe that will help..
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot if anyone replies[

It doesnt matter if lights are on or not.  I was told that you can project any time you are comfortable enough to sleep.  Learning obe is like learning any skill it can take time.  My suggestion to you would to be practice and dont expect anything just watch see what happens. trying to hard will stop you in your tracks.

NPerez: Lights on or off is down to personal preference. With me I can find it a little distracting during mid-summer months when it's light very early morning. But it's something I get used to. Covers on or off, again makes no difference with me. What can make a difference is if I'm feeling either too hot, or too cold.
<br>
<br>
Whether you are trying too hard is a tad difficult to gauge without knowing any details of what it is you are doing exactly. Generally, projection is a natural process which needs to be kick-started. In other words, it's not something that can be forced. So everything you try should be done with this in mind. Trying "hard" can cause mental tension which tends to put a spoke in the works. This is why people sometimes report they made a burst of progress when they decided to relax into it more.
<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure if you realise that people can summon the aid of non-physical helpers who will assist you from their end. To do this, all you need do is request their help and become open to whatever assistance is provided. The mystical/religious definition of this process is commonly called prayer. But there's no need to start kneeling, putting your hands together and all that jazz.
<br>
<br>
These helpers are limited in the assistance they can give. Which is largely limited by your ability to perceive, which is linked to your willingness to believe. This is the reason why I say you must "become open" to whatever assistance is provided.
<br>
<br>
What I do is stop what I happen to be doing for a moment, and place a clear mental intent for an answer to whatever it is I'm stuck on. I do this anywhere between 5 to 10 times spaced fairly evenly throughout the day. The answer normally either pops in mind within a day or two, or I get the answer during a projection.
