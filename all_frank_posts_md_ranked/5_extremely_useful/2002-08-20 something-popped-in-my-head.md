Hi all!
<br>
<br>
I was trying for an OBE again earlier today. I had cleared my surface mind pretty well and felt kinda relaxed but not enough to project as I found out.
<br>
So I tried to make the most of it and decided to ask about my guide.
<br>
Suddenly something went POP quit loudly in my head and the vibrations that had eluded me before started as if a switch had been thrown. Also my minds yey went from fairly quiet to a colorful sparkly view much like an TV channel with no feed. Nothing else happened as I was a bit startled by the suddenness of it all and a couple of thoughts slipped through the surface.
<br>
Weird experience.
<br>
Anyone care to speculate as to what the pop was? Guide uncoorking a bottle of wine? Did I get my mind blown (pun intended)?

<section>
I have noticed that when making the transition from your physical body to an OBE experience, a "popping sound" is something commonly heard during the exit process.  I am not sure if this "POP" is a disconnect, or simply a hypnogogic sound that certain people hear.  In addition to pops, you may hear voices, screams, loud, wind-like noises, or things of that nature.

This wasn't a sound really, more like a popping feeling but it felt loud.
<br>
I figure it had something to do with what I was doing, possible with the transition even. If so, then it was the first intentional and conscious brush with the astral. Go me!

Does that mean maybe you projected successfully and then the mind split effect ate the recall of it? If so, congratulations. I have heard of hearing popping sounds when going out of body, but the idea of hearing the popping and staying in the body sounded unfamiliar. Doesn't Robert Bruce have suggestions for when that happens, to help download the memories from the perspective of the physical body?

<section>
Drat, I forgot the mind split thingy! Now that I think about it I recall a jolt a bit after the pop and the vibrations. The kind you get sometimes when you're about to fall asleep and suddenly jump wide awake.
<br>
I'll have to dissect the experience again to find out what I did differently from previous attempts.
<br>
Thanks for the reminder.
<br>
<br>
Yeah. He said to keep cool and in a meditative state with as calm a miond as possible so that the projected double's memories are the most vivid while the download takes place. AND I FORGOT THAT COMPLETELY!!!! Only read AD about  a dozen times by now.

Pops, bangs, ripping noises, stomping sounds, shrieks, etc., etc., are all very normal (particularly at first). Also, the lights you saw in your mind, that's what happens when the 3rd-eye switches on. Though, at the moment, it seems like everything is taking you by surprise. But all this roughness and surprise will fade away with more practise.
<br>
<br>
The key thing is to simply put the various difficulties in the hands of those who are helping you from the Astral. Ask them to slow things down a bit for you, and so on.
<br>
<br>
It may seem weird, and you may feel like you are simply talking to yourself, and that there is no-one there really. But I found, to my incredible surprise, guides are always there reaching out to try and help you. Problem is, there is only so far they can reach through all the mental garbage. So if you clear away that garbage, and mentally reach out to them, they will be able to reach down and make contact.
<br>
<br>
Yours,

<br>
I thought I'd edit this experience in, that I had this morning, as an example:
<br>
<br>
Yesterday I posted that I had given up trying to find a way of navigating the Astral on my own. I stood within the Astral and formally conceded defeat. So my next step was to seek out a guide to help me navigate the higher plains.
<br>
<br>
I did have a regular guide (who I nicknamed Harry) but, as I said in the post, I hadn't seen him for a while as the novelty of having him take me on tours of the lower regions has worn off.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so I go to Focus 10 and mentally reach out my intention for a guide to take me to Focus 27 and the following is an account of what happened when that contact came about:
<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
Blackness, asked for clarity, a few seconds later saw a shadow. Asked for more clarity. Then sensed a familiar figure to the side of me... Harry!!!!
<br>
<br>
<i>
 So you still recognise my presence.
</i>
<br>
<br>
How could I forget, we had some good times, what are you doing here?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 You wanted a hand, what was it now, something to do with Focus 27?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, that's right, I keep trying to go there but.......
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Failed miserably would be an accurate way of describing it.
</i>
<br>
<br>
I just thought maybe I could step out on my own now the novelty of touring around the lower plains has worn off. No offence and all that.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 No offence taken. Changing the subject, I see you have made good progress with the Hemi-Sync. You reached out directly there. What happened to the roundabout way?
</i>
<br>
<br>
Well, it all got a bit too, er, roundabout. You know me Harry, always looking to make things more simple.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Look, there's something we need to straighten out before moving on.
</i>
<br>
<br>
What's that?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 You must stop calling me Harry.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Whoops, sorry Harry. I mean, er, what is your proper name? Come on, tell me, I promise I won't laugh.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
<i>
 My name is Harath.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Ah, now I know where I got the Harry from. I told you my non-verbal comm's are a bit iffy. Okay, I promise I'll call you by your real name from now on. So can we go to Focus 27 now?
<br>
<br>
<i>
 By all means I will take you there, anything special you'd like to do?
</i>
<br>
<br>
I thought as we haven't seen each other for a bit, we could go to some bar and chill out over a few drinks; chat to some ladies, listen to music, that sort of thing. Then maybe we can have a wander round.
<br>
<br>
<i>
 Hmm, very well, I'll see what I can come up with. Hold tight!"

I'm not weirded out by the noises anymore. It's just that this time I wasn't expecting them at all and since the sound wasn't audible but a bit like cracking your knuckle in your head I was surprised. I was asking about the name of my guide with athe inten to request help with the projecting bit.
<br>
But I can understand the bit your said about guides not being able to get through the mental static in our heads. I think this is exactly what happened, I managed to clear it more than before and finally made a connection possible.
<br>
Funny thing is I didn't feel my mind was any calmer than on previous attempts.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the description of the experience. Do you suppose there is a specific guide for us instead of several different ones?

<br>
<br>
<br>
Understand that you do not have to completely clear your mind so it is devoid of all thoughts. If you did that you would not be able to do anything...
<i>
 because it is the thought-energy that enables you to project
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
That's why your mental focus is all important. In other words, you have to channel the right kind of thoughts in the right direction. Because, again, thought is a primary energy. What *completely* scuppers the process is all the emotional baggage and/or other such mental kak that people generally carry around in their heads.
<br>
<br>
So focus and intent are extremely important, together with expectation.
<br>
<br>
Focus your mind with a specific intent and expect a result. If the expected result doesn't come about right away, simply imagine that it has. Then take a step back and try again.
<br>
<br>
This is a little technique I picked up fairly recently where you practice talking to guides:
<br>
<br>
First go to Focus 10 and simply start having a conversation with a guide. Don't even think about the Physical not one iota. Don't even question whether or not you are at Focus 10. Have no doubts whatsoever of your intention.
<br>
<br>
At first, I would ask simple questions and imagine the replies. Then, after about the 4th or 5th attempt, I got a reply back from a question which stopped me dead. I thought, er, hang on a minute, I didn't imagine that response. Then I clearly heard a female voice saying, "No, that is correct, it was me... hello!"
<br>
<br>
I tell you, it was freaky when it first happened but the process quickly becomes second nature.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<br>
Yup. That's what was different from previous tries. Like I mentioned earlier this thread I had a clear question about the name of the guide so I wasn't totally blank but rather more in tune with what I was attempting. I can blank out like bugger so maybe I need to fill the void with the thought and intent like you said.

Excellent advise. I'll do that, actually I think I was doing it when the pop popped but not as consciously as I could or should have.

I think that at this point I'm willing to admit I'm banging my head against a wall and need someone to point me to the door.

What i'm pretty sure it was was ur pineal gland. in science, its purpose is unknown, but it secretes melatonin which helps to slow ur brainwaves down, and hence deepen ur trance. the same thing's happened to me after a good deal of energy work. if ur interested, do a search on it, its actually pretty interesting. hope this helped

<section>
<br>
<br>
Jouni, another pointer:
<br>
<br>
Because we are SO used to being in our physical bodies, we tend to use that body as a yardstick which we compare against to check if we are making progress. Sort of like a base reference if you will.
<br>
<br>
If we feel something like a mental shift, it is only natural (in order to verify if we have in fact, shifted away from the Physical) to instantly try and compare where we are now, to where we would feel normally in the Physical. But the moment we do that, our focus instantly shifts back to the Physical.
<br>
<br>
So the mental shift comes across as being something that was not actual but was imagined: and we were really in the Physical all the time. Which is frustrating, because you begin to doubt your experiences and think it's all a product of the imagination. Well, that's how it was for me. Until a guide pointed out to me where I was going wrong.

Hi Jouni,
<br>
<br>
Ive felt that click a couple of times, not recently though, probably about a year and a half ago. I dont know why I only felt it then. Oh well. I just remembered reading an article on the amygdala a while back so I have a link to the part of the site that its on if you would like to read it. Its an astral projection site, so it does relate back to projection.

I thin I got a bit impatient. After the click and the change in the vision I did get anything else and started to analyze the state I was in. Didn't think about the physical though, I've learned to control that part pretty well. But I had enormous trouble before when I'd get all excited and blow the mind shift thingy.

Jouni,
<br>
<br>
I was browsing the web last night looking for more info on AP, gathering info on methods, what might be stopping me, etc., and I came across something that reminded me of your initial question here.
<br>
<br>
Now I'm sorry I can't remember the actual site, but it mentioned the various noises that can accompany "lift-off", and the pops or bangs are, according to the owner of this site, related specifically to Kundalini energy. Other noises related to something else but I wasn't paying that much attention to the other bits.
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
that was a really intersting account that you gave us of your interaction with your guide on the astral. I was quir\te fascinated by that. If you don't mind though, at risk of asking a possibly well worn question, What is Focus 10, Focus 27, etc?  I haven't really been following that.

Focus 10=mind awake, body asleep.

and all the others are different states of consciousness.

R. A. Monroe used these Focus terms for breaking down the various states of consciousness.  Read his books or the site:

<br>
James:
<br>
<br>
The Monroe school of thinking does not incorporate the usual mystical terminology you often come across when researching articles and/or experiences to do with the Astral. (Which is very much like Robert Bruce's attitude also.)
<br>
<br>
As such, more modern-day terms are used to label the various Astral planes. The reason the word "focus" came about, is basically because where your focal point of awareness is placed or projected, that "place" becomes your reality.
<br>
<br>
For example, in the Monroe school, Focus 27 is the label given to what is generally called the True Afterlife region (I have no idea what the mystical label is). Therefore, if you project your focal point of awareness within Focus 27, then Focus 27 becomes your reality.
<br>
<br>
You'll find a lot of info about this on the Internet.

The key thing to always bear in mind is to keep
<i>
 asking
</i>
for more clarity, or more light, or more understanding, or whatever it is you feel you need. Keep asking and expecting; keep moving forwards with intent to grow; to discover; and to comprehend.
<br>
<br>
Eventually you will get into the habit of doing so, and you will be introduced to who it is (or who they are) that is/are helping you. Please understand that they ARE there. I know it may sound daft, and it may appear like you are just talking to yourself (that's what I felt at first). Fact is, I was bowled over when I first realised just how close the Astral is to our ordinary consciousness.
<br>
<br>
Keep talking to them, and keep listening out for their guiding responses. As I say, if you don't get any at first (very normal) then just imagine you did and keep pushing deeper and deeper within.

Frank, I'm glad you've also confirmed for me a mode of communication that I always thought valid, but still have the bad habit of questioning if its my thoughts or not. We are glad to know that we are

First you need to learn to recognise what your thoughts are. Then you can instantly recognise thoughts entering your mind that were not originated by you.
<br>
<br>
So basically you need to stop thinking. Well, to do that literally is impossible. But it is surprising how much mental kak is generated from holding opinions about things. That's why I dumped any opinion that was not vital to my existence. Sometimes, for social purposes, I may adopt an opinion but always make sure it gets positively and completely dumped once its purpose has been served.
<br>
<br>
Incidentaly, now this "new age" stuff is getting more commercial, I'm meeting people on a social level who (thinking they are being really daring and modern) strike up conversations about mystical topics such as the afterlife, energising Chakras, and bits and bobs like that. I pretend I don't know a thing, obviously, but it's great knowing just the right "innocent" question to ask, at precisely the right point in the conversation.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Anyhow, after clearing away all the kak, you will find your mind becomes surprisingly quiet. You'll notice thoughts now echo off the walls and everything seems very bare by comparison. That's how you need to keep it. With me, I don't read newspapers; watch the news; watch any violent movies; I don't vote; have no interest in politics, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>
Plus, all emotions should be firmly locked away. Though selected amounts can be brought out when necessary. (In that event make sure all the emotional energy is consumed, or mentally discard any residual.)
<br>
<br>
Always bear in mind, that the collective sense of conscious awareness you take with you to the Astral is
<u>
 exactly
</u>
the same as the one you have on the Physical. This is one mother of a stumbling block, that puts a humungous spoke in the works. (Even putting it that way is the understatement of the century.)
<br>
<br>
But, being Physical, gives us a great chance of having big mental clearout that puts us in good stead to make rapid progress on the Astral. For example: the only basic difference between the people in the true afterlife region (Focus 27) and the people in the Belief System regions (Focus' 24; 25 &amp; 26) is the realisation that:
<i>
 thought is a primary energy that creates your surroundings.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Basically, the people on Focus 27 know they are dead and realise they can create their own surroundings to a greater or lesser extent.
<br>
<br>
The people in the Belief System regions may or may not know they are dead. But the one thing they don't know is that their surroundings are entirely created through concensus reality. Some realise and leave (or are rescued) and some are perfectly fine as they are: believing they have found heaven, and are in-touch with God and all that jazz.
<br>

<br>
Ok, thinking jokes and bad schizophrenia jokes aside, I understand what you're saying about clearing surface thoughts. At a time when I was suffering a lot from stress I learned some techniques from Paul Wilson's "Complete Calm" book on meditation to silence the self talk and calm the mind right down. Self talk when let run rampant can be very self destructive!
<br>
<br>
As time progressed such meditation became more second nature and  I started to learn to look and listen without mentally commenting. I believe at that time my higher self was better able to communicate ideas to me. Now I have a guide who's voice I am becoming more attuned to.
<br>
<br>
Though my guide is female, I am still able to somewhat replicate her voice, just as you would replay a song or a TV ad in your mind. Despite this I have noticed that when my mind is quiet, and she has something to tell me, the timbre of her voice is quite distinctive, and subtly different from my mind's copy of it.
<br>
<br>
I think what I really sought confirmation on was that our guides do speak directly into our mind, and while in the physical world it is not something audibly external to our bodies. Even the first time I met her in a vision, though I could see her just as I would look at anyone standing in front of me, her voice has always been of a telapathic nature.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your info Frank. It has confirmed for me that guides do speak directly into our minds. I had considered this to be the case, but it is reassuring to read the same account from someone else.
<br>
<br>
Jouni, once again sorry for hogging the conversation on your topic. Have you had anymore success with AP attempts?

Greetings,
<br>
<br>
I understand that many folks hear an almost audible "click" when they exit.
<br>
I think some folks have reported a "tearing...velcro" kind of sound as well. Could the "pop" you experienced be a manifestation of that phenomena?
<br>
<br>
I have not succeeded in "conscious" exit yet myself...so I am no expert but it sounds like you were very close to getiing out...especially since the vibrations followed.

Had something similar happen today. No clicks or pops this time but after a while of relaxing and strivinig for the all-elusive cool I felt what was like a switch thrown and suddenly I was crystal clear feeling vibes and completely at loss as to what comes next. I knew I should flop but didnät know how [(:]So again I just felt around trying to memorize the feeling and state of mind.
<br>
But these experiences are getting more and more frequent so I'm now convinced that the astral is really really right here! And the trick to get there is just too simple at the moment for me to grasp enough to switch there.

Jouni: Hermitic, no, though I do understand why you may think that.
<br>
<br>
I love to entertain and very much enjoy being a gracious and attentive host. Plus, I do very much like being around other people in all the typical kinds of social circumstances (especially other females). But with me, it is a matter of not being influenced by other people's emotive kak.
<br>
<br>
I think once you can do that, being around other people becomes really very enjoyable. One of the things I'm very much looking forward to doing is arranging some decent parties on F27. I just love that upbeat atmosphere that is created when a number of positive and like-minded people get together in a glamorous setting.

  I know this might be intruding a bit but I've noticed that most of what I've seen or read has suggested that as soon as you think of your body, or you feel fear or shock, you imediately snap back. Now does this apply for everystage, like if you're half out does this still apply, or is it a completely different matter at that point?
  <br>
  For those of you who are wondering I'm asking this because of an experience I've had when I was floating out of my body, I didn't really realize it was an OBE, when I was scared and shocked and wanted to be fully awake, mind and body. I couldn't though and had to really work and concentrate on openning my eyes for a few minutes before it worked.

  You yearn for something you do not know, search for something just beyond your thoughts, long to return to a land you've never been to, and need something you've never heard of. Knowledge will fill that gap, as soon as you realize that knowledge comes after emotion and you need both to lay the foundations of your world.

Leslie-There are reports of people looking at their body while out, seems like I have never looked back. I can take a certain amount of fear, but a sudden shock will send me back in.  It seems like the first experiences are the hardest to comprehend and it takes a while to get our wings.

The only time there is a sensation of "flopping out" is when projecting into the RT zone. This is what I call a classic Out of Body Experience (OBE). Which is what Monroe, for example, would experience in his early years.
<br>
<br>
However, as with most things, technology has moved on. The idea nowadays, when projecting within the Astral, is to think of the concept of phasing-in. I think it is more apt because you don't actually feel like you are "out of body" at all.
<br>
<br>
The feeling is more like you are still within your physical body. Only instead of being within the Physical realm, you are now within the Astral realm. In other words, phasing-in, is more to do with a switching of mental focus: not actual bodies. Of course, you are not literally still in your physical body. But you are in a body and it doesn't look or feel all that much different to actually being in your physical body. If you get what I mean.
<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to get across is, the accent should be placed on shifting your mental focus, not switching bodies. When shifting your focus like this, there is no sensation of switching bodies. In your mind, the Astral should just come into view. And you kinda mentally step into it. Or you can think of it another way, like, it sort of envelops you.
<br>
<br>
At the moment of the Astral coming into view I am often still aware of the physical. Not to any great extent. But I am not in a pure "mind awake, body asleep state" either. (Virtually, but not absolutely.) However, once I mentally step into the Astral (or I'm mentally enveloped by it) then all awareness of the Physical realm goes away.

Right. There's the switch I'm looking for. Come to think of it I may have been in the astral already (the 2 experiences in this thread) but haven't had my senses functioning properly. There wasn't really much of an exit sensation just th etiny pop and a bit of tingle and then, well basically loads of nothingness w/some colourful dots in it.
<br>
I'll do it though, one of these days.

Hey Frank!  That "phasing in" stuff is too advanced for most of us!!!!!!

<br>
I don't want us to give newbies the misconception that OBE is as easy as thinking about it and phasing in  . . . nevermind that it's true.
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_big.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>

<br>
<br>
The fact is, 99% of the folks who visit this Forum, if they are eventually to succeed at OBE, will probably experience it in the old, jangly, vibrating, freaky-sleep-paralysis and separate-body kind of way.   Like Monroe did in his early days.
<br>
<br>
I have the feeling that "phasing in" is something you manage to accomplish after mastering this "old" way of OBE-ing . . . probably after several years of doing it the old way.  For instance, it's taken me almost 4 years to go from "old jalopy in need of a tune-up" to "high-tech mini-bike" (in terms of the way my OBEs feel and sound).  My experience is probably "normal" - - -
<br>
<br>
(hey! that's weird! my mindset is now that it's normal!  cool!)

I'm sorry to be seeming to go against what you say, because you do make an excellent point. But I'm not altogether sure whether the old way is, in fact, easier or not.
<br>
<br>
Having tried it both ways, the phasing-in concept feels far more natural than, 1) feeling like I'm sitting on an unbalanced spin-dryer revolving at high speed, then 2) having the sensation of being shot from a cannon.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the phasing-in way is how the Monroe institute teaches people (not that I'm overly struck by TMI, it's just an observation). So I think it's perhaps best not to think of phasing-in as being more advanced: just different.
<br>
<br>
From what you say, you appear to be making good progress. Soon I'll be sending you an invite to my proposed party on F27. (Well, when I can learn to get to the place with any degree of reliability that is.)
