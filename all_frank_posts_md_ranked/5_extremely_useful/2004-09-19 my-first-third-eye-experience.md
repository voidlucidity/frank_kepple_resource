Not sure if this is the right place to post this or not?
<br>
<br>
I have for years now been extremely frustrated that I can't see anything when my eyes are closed apart from darkness and occasionally the odd swirling colours.
<br>
But this morning I had 3 separate experiences of what I think was my third eye functioning?
<br>
<br>
I woke up at 10:50 (yep, had lazy day) and just laid in my bed thinking to myself, when I dream I can see anything and everything... but when I wake up and close my eyes I see darkness, but as I've just woke up maybe I can attempt to focus on seeing an image in my mind.  At first it was just darkness... but then I started to see Static, like what you see in a television screen on the wrong channel. I then saw an outline around the static like I was actually watching a television screen. I was totally amazed by this because I was clearly conscious and fully awake, then I saw a white light in the middle of all that static so I decided to look through it and it's like I went through the static and the white light became bigger and bigger, suddenly I was in a caravan park with lots of caravans and children playing, I could see birds flying in the sky and the sky was a beautiful blue everything was so vivid I was flabbergasted.  I made sure I was still awake by waving my hands in the air (my real hands). This experience lasted for about 20 seconds and then the image started fading.  I tried another 2 more times each time it worked but it got harder and harder and the experience lasted less and less.
<br>
<br>
I was and am now so excited by my first experience of seeing something in my minds eye without actually being asleep... I'm looking forward to trying it out tonight in bed.
<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me to whether it was my third eye or just imagination?
<br>
The reason I think it's my third eye is because the vivid images I saw happened without me thinking about them, I didn't imagine the caravan park or the birds flying in the sky etc it all happened as though I was actually watching television in real time.

<section>
Hello tsotonwa, what was your experience of your third eye?
<br>
<br>
I Hypothesize that we try to hard thus getting too frustrated. But it's incredibly difficult not to be frustrated under the circumstances of excitement. I mean you have this spontaneous experience only to be disheartened that you can't get it to happen again, which on a subconscious level creates a mental block.
<br>
<br>
Maybe we should think or "know" we can do it, and just let it happen.  This is just me speaking generally.

<br>
<br>
The reason why you see darkness is because when you are awake your focus of awareness tends to reside behind your physical eyes. So when your eyelids are shut then all you see is darkness.
<br>
<br>
When you are asleep your focus of awareness naturally shifts. The key is to cause that shift while remaining "awake". Which, for most people, is a heck of a tricky mental balancing act to perform.
<br>
<br>
What you experienced was fairly normal in the general scheme of things. In other words, that's how it tends to come about. Now you've been given a taster it should spur you on to try and experience it again and again.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the main distinction between imagination and a real experience is the feeling that what you saw could never have been a product of your imagination. Like, it just happens, as you say, entirely without you actually thinking about it. The experience should just flow of its own accord without you in any way having to force it. As you say, as if you were watching television. That's exactly right. You mentally sit back and observe the experience.
<br>
<br>
Then, once you have got used to doing that, take a deep breath and mentally step into the screen you are watching. At which point you will find yourself immersed in the non-physical realm, where you are free to explore and interact with people just as you do while physical.
<br>
<br>

<section>
Thank you Frank....
<br>
<br>
So I have to learn to shift my focus of awareness from the awake physical state to the awake non-physical state, sounds difficult!
<br>
That morning it happened so naturally, but thinking back I recall feeling my attention in my brow chakra and at first focusing was easy, then as it got harder I found myself starting to squint and feel pressure in my head.
<br>
<br>
Indeed having been given a taster it has spurred me on to experience it again... unfortunately at present I haven't experienced it since that morning, consequently the night after I suffered insomnia. (Lol)
<br>
<br>
So Frank by shifting my focus of attention would that also give me the capability of imaging something vividly?  I worry that I'm the minority that can't even imagine a Lemon.  I mean I know what it looks like, I could even imagine what it tastes like and feels like, but I'm not actually seeing it, it's just memory.
<br>
<br>
Once again thank you very much for your advice, I really appreciate it.

<br>
<br>
I'm not sure whether difficult is the right word. It's tricky to get the hang of, yes, and I think it is also possible for a person to try too hard. You have been at this for some time without any real results, and the thought occurs to me that's maybe what you are doing wrong. Then, one time when you were in just the right kind of relaxed state of mind, up it comes.
<br>
<br>
Try shifting your focus of awareness around your body by imagining separate body parts for a few minutes at a time. That's a good excercise a lot of people have found useful. Once you get a feel for that, start to place your focus at different points in your head.
<br>
<br>
One particular mental stance I found gives great results is to imagine being at a point about in the middle of your neck and looking up into the mass expanse of the mind. Think of yourself as a point of consciousness and you are looking upwards in a direction towards the top of your head. From where you are is an empty space for, say, about 10 or 20 feet and then the expanse of the mind begins.
<br>
<br>
Imagine the mass expanse of the mind as huge grey clouds that expand upwards and outwards into infinity. Keep looking at those clouds above you gently swirling around...
<i>
 but stay looking from the point of view of looking upwards from the middle of your neck
</i>
. Like you were looking up through the top of your head (that's very important). At first you'll no doubt feel yourself slipping, and find yourself looking once again at the backs of your eyelids.
<br>
<br>
When you feel comfortable with looking upwards through the top of your head, mentally reach up into the clouds. Keep looking from the same point at the middle of your neck, but imagine a line of contact reaching out from you and going upwards. As you are a fan of Star Trek then imagine sending out a tractor beam.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
Imagine that the Tractor Beam (or whatever you imagine) contains a message from you asking for help in making the transition between the physical and the non-physical. Keep broadcasting the message every 2 or 3 minutes, and between broadcasts simply stay in the same mental position quietly observing what you see.
<br>
<br>
You need to remain hopeful and expecting that somone will come along and give you a hand up, so to speak. If you feel yourself getting despondent then stop the excercise and try again another time. Getting despondent puts a big spoke in the works. Which is one of the problems with trying too hard - you get disheartened. So it's far better to practice little and often, in a positive frame of mind.
<br>
<br>
What should happen is one time you try you'll see the clouds make some kind of variation. Perhaps a person will appear and they float above you, beckoning you to come towards them; or maybe you'll see an area that suddenly lights up a different colour; or whatever. When it happens, mentally reach out towards it and allow the energy of it to lift you upwards.
<br>

Hi Frank me again: D
<br>
<br>
I've given it what.... 4 months but to no avail.  Perhaps I am getting to despondent and maybe over keen.  Unfortunately the greatest experience I've had since that day has been visualizing swirling colours which doesn't equate too much significance! and even this wasn't vivid.  The Powers that be obviously don't think I'm ready to be unleashed into the world of virtual reality. "or maybe I just need a holodeck, hmmmm..."

<section>
Have you tried listening to any guided visualization tapes?  I find it helpful to have an outside voice to concentrate on.  The original thing I started with involved going down an escalator, then an elevator, then coming out onto a gorgeous beach &amp; swimming &amp; running.  There's more &amp; more, but you get the idea.
<br>
<br>
Now I'm an artist, so I never had much trouble visualizing stuff.  It sounds like maybe your primary input is not visual, &amp; so you might be better off with a different type of meditation.  Perhaps chanting or dancing or another modality.  If you really want to go visual, then I'd suggest staring at a physical object, like your lemon, &amp; then closing your eyes &amp; trying to reconstruct as much of the lemon as you can with your eyes shut.  Open your eyes &amp; look at the lemon again, taking in more details.  Then close them &amp; further enhance your original image.  Worth a try?  Good luck.

<section>
Captain:
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I have only just now noticed your post of Jan 20.
<br>
<br>
The swirling colours sounds to me very much like the beginnings of the Monroe Focus 12 state. I tend to visualise swirling colours as well as I've mentioned before in my posts. If you were to do a quick search on "swirling colours" and "Frank" then you might find some pointers of interest to you.
<br>
<br>
As for the visuals you saw that morning a while ago. This is tantalising because you offered yourself a demonstration of your abilities as "proof" you could do it. Yet when you try, in a sense, purposely, you can't make it work. As you have been trying for a while I feel I should make clear to you that this is how it tends to be all down the line. With me, even now, with every step I take there is reluctance. I want to do it, make no mistake, but there is reluctance. A mixture of doubt, and fear, of the "unknown". Many times I have taken a step forward wondering if this time might not be my "last".
<br>
<br>
Against the light of that, we human beings still insist upon making these discoveries. And so what we do is offer ourselves a little glimpse, we take a quick step around the corner to snatch a glance, and then step back double-quick to the safe ground we were at before. I feel that this is what you have done.
<br>
<br>
I took a quick glance once and was immediately hit by a blast of energy that sent me reeling at light-speed. It felt like every molecule, every atom, and every element of consciousness of my whole sense of being was being ripped to shreds. The only way I can describe it is like getting caught on a high-voltage power cable and having that current rip through your body, but have it done to you continuously, like you would never lose consciousness and you would never die. And that is how it was always going to be forever.
<br>
<br>
I got out of it eventually. After thinking about it for a while, I figured I had offered myself the very worst conditions I would ever have to face, and I had survived that, so what else is there to fear? Since that time, I've been a lot more confident in my ability just to let the experience flow. That's the key to all this, you have to just let it flow. Allow yourself to become it, as opposed to trying to go to it, or point to it, with some kind of "method". Just lay back and simply become it.
<br>
<br>
At which point people usually say, "Yeah, but Frank it's okay for you but when I close my eyes all I see is blackness."Well, that is all I see at first! I think often that people are too hasty to discount these initial stages, and they just go off on some method.
<br>
<br>
When I close my eyes all I see is blackness. But I think the essential difference between me and a lot of beginners is when
<i>
 they
</i>
close their eyes they are not really
<u>
 noticing
</u>
. And that's another key to it... that of
<i>
 noticing
</i>
self. I think people just get too wrapped up in methods and techniques, and it prevents them from really noticing themselves.
<br>
<br>
When I close my eyes all I see is blackness, which is normal. I'll wriggle around a bit to get comfy, maybe my knee is itching and my hair is tickling my ear or something. So I'll sort all that out and just concentrate on breathing gently for 5 minutes or so. Now, because I am
<i>
 noticing
</i>
as opposed to avidly trying to perfect and follow some technique or method, my full attention is taken by the simple act of noticing.
<br>
<br>
I read a post today where someone keeps trying and they are saying about how they are concentrating upon holding their awareness outside of themselves, and at the same time they are concentrating on "raising energy" and doing everything correctly, and whatever... but nothing is happening. That's right, because all their attention is fixated elsewhere, whereas all my attention is fixated on
<i>
 noticing
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Noticing what?
<br>
<br>
Well, nothing at first, there's not much to see really but blackness. But then, after a short while, I may see that perhaps one part of the blackness is not quite so black. Perhaps there was just a brief flash of something, then maybe a sensation of a movement somewhere else. Maybe I just heard someone call my name. Hmm, that's interesting, I might think, I wonder where that came from. But I don't get too curious I just keep noticing. I might see swirling areas of not quite so black as the rest. I might see flashes of this and that. As I am offering myself these images, my attention is steadily becoming more fixated within.
<br>
<br>
As my attention becomes fixated within, from the act of noticing, at this stage I am not aware of my physical body. Part of my awareness realises that somewhere in the background is a physical body, in bed, etc. but I have phased away from it. Before, the forefront of my awareness was my physical and 180 degrees turned around from that, in the background of my awareness, was the non-physical. But now there has been a "phase shift" i.e. a turning through 180 degrees. Now, my previous foreground (physical) is my background, and my previous background (non-physical) is my foreground.
<br>
<br>
This is what is meant by "phasing" because you cause a 180-degree Phase Shift between the non-physical and the physical. Monroe first coined the term as he was an electronics engineer and I graduated in electronics, before I got into technical authoring and then into publishing and marketing. But that's another story. Anyhow, what I want to say is because I understand electronics, I understand where Monroe was coming from as he was picturing it like it were two voltages, 180 degrees out of phase with each other. Hence he coined the term Phasing.
<br>
<br>
But I guess people generally have difficulties picturing two voltages 180-degrees out of phase with each other. So, instead, imagine a revolving door that is the entrance to a building. Any old building, it doesn't matter.
<br>
<br>
You are standing outside the building. So the "outside" is your reality. You are aware of a reality that exists inside the building, but is closed to you by the door. Now, go through and turn the door 180 degrees and stop (oh, in case anyone doesn't know there are 360 degrees in a circle, so 180 degrees is half a circle). Now, you are inside the building. So the "inside" is your reality. You are aware of a reality that exists outside the building, but it is closed to you by the door. Now again go through and turn the door by 180 degrees, and stop. So now, the "outside" is your reality again.
<br>
<br>
Each time you go though the door and turn through 180 degrees, there is a 180-degree "phase shift" between your awareness of the outside and your awareness of the inside, in terms of your reality.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so as my attention becomes fixated within, from the act of noticing, this causes a 180-degree phase shift between my awareness of the physical (outer) and my awareness of the non-physical (inner) sense of reality. So from then on, I continue to notice anything that may come about. I'm not all that curious, I'm not trying to make anything happen, I'm not enacting some kind of method or technique, I'm simply looking within and noticing what is taking place, and the act of doing that is focusing my attention.
<br>
<br>
As a person focuses their attention within themselves, through the action of noticing, they allow themselves to view "snippets" of other dimensions of reality. This action is translated objectively as the perception of flashes of all manner of this and that, random images that come and go, all kinds of spurious sounds, and so forth. Doing this is the equivalent of quickly taking a peek around a corner to snatch a glance, as I said earlier, then we step back double-quick to the safe ground we were at before.
<br>
<br>
As regards yourself, Captain, it would appear that you are comfortable in offering yourself a glimpse of "swirling colours" but you are not comfortable in accepting a full-on awareness such as you offered yourself before. Perhaps you offered it to yourself to have a kind of "carrot to the donkey" effect, which would stimulate you into progressing in a particular direction. What I would suggest is you follow the simple "noticing" exercise and see what other basic images you will put before you. In other words, put the idea of repeating the main experience aside for now, and keep it really simple.
<br>
<br>
I think, ultimately, what people who follow the Phasing approach need to be realising is: the other dimensions of reality only
<i>
 seem
</i>
to be objectively separated. But in reality, there is no separation in consciousness. We place a veil between the place we call "here" and the place we call "there" for the purposes of our experience. However, all these dimensions of reality are all affecting, entwined, and exchanging energy with us within every moment of our existence! It's just that we objectively CHOOSE not to view this action.
<br>
<br>
By following the action of noticing, what you are basically saying to yourself is: "Okay, self, I would like to objectively choose to view this action for a while."
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

Making this a "sticky" was a good call, Major Tom!
<br>
<br>
Frank, that last post (especially) was a really helpful explanation, imo, and a rather strong point is your description of
<b>
 <i>
  noticing
 </i>
</b>
. I hadn't thought of it like that before, and from my (still learning) experiences with phasing you've explained it so fundamentally well.
<br>
<br>
The first real "glimpse" I personally recall (apart from the swirling patterns and colors that come first for me), was that of a
<u>
 beautiful
</u>
shining city. You described this type of experience above: "As a person focuses their attention within themselves, through the action of noticing, they allow themselves to view "snippets" of other dimensions of reality. This action is translated objectively as the perception of flashes of all manner of this and that, random images that come and go, all kinds of spurious sounds, and so forth." That city was only a "snippet", but unquestionably (to my experience) a glimpse of another dimension of reality.
<br>
<br>
Another critically important statement you made, in my humble opinion, is: " I think, ultimately, what people who follow the Phasing approach need to be realising is: the other dimensions of reality only seem to be objectively separated. But in reality, there is no separation in consciousness. We place a veil between the place we call "here" and the place we call "there" for the purposes of our experience. However, all these dimensions of reality are all affecting, entwined, and exchanging energy with us within every moment of our existence! It's just that we objectively CHOOSE not to view this action." That statement (again based on my limited experiences) is a completely accurate one.

<section>
Wow ! What a good read this thread has been ! Allow me to add an experience I've had a couple days ago. I agree very much with Frank, simply noticing seems much more powerful that trying to do some kind of exercise....
<br>
<br>
While i was lying in my bed after making very passionate love to my girlfriend, and feeling TOTALLY relaxed, warm and fuzzy ( you know that feeling Right ? ) i just watched the inside of my eyelids for a while. Slowly, a horizon faded into view. Being relaxed as i was, i didn't get excited enough to make it go away again, and the view got more elaborate. I noticed a very bright highway in front of me, and cars in the distance.
<br>
<br>
Everything was fuzzy and indistinct, but the horizon was getting sharper, and i felt some kind of cold wash over me.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly i was on a bicycle, speeding on that highway. The air was chilling, freezing even, but somehow very pleasant. The sun colored the sky golden, and i could see miles away, in all directions. I was going really fast on that bike, and it didn't cost me any effort at all,like i was going downhill. For some reason, i felt ecstatic. I knew i was safe in this place, this place was eternal and the most REAL place i had ever been too. I realized that i was not in the real Netherlands any more
<img alt=":-)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
I knew i was dreaming, or out of body. I got of the highway and decided to go for a herring sandwich, because in this place i can go and do whatever i want, and i was pretty hungry. I got of the highway, maneuvering between speeding cars like it was nothing.
<br>
<br>
I entered the fish restaurant, and everything changed. The people in the restaurant where more like dolls then real people,they just stared at me with a quizzical look on their face,
<i>
 empty
</i>
<br>
<br>
I bought the herring- sandwich, and stuffed the whole thing down my throat without biting anything into smaller bits. I choked and woke up.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you guys ( Frank ? ) know what happened when i entered that restaurant ? It felt like i entered a different, less significant ... realm.. or something.

wow, so this was my third eye. I used to see vivid pictures and think I was talking to someone right before I go to sleep, but I usually wasn't very concious. I can now stay completely concious and see scenery and stuff evryday. It is so wierd, its like Im seeing it completely but it's sort of well wierd ( cant really explain it). I also see these scenes right when I come out of a trance, which I have been going into automatically somehow for about the past couple weeks or so. I haven't had an OBE yet but I think I will soon.
<br>
So if you know how to stimulate your Third Eye Chakra, can you watch your mind like this all the time?

Frank:
<br>
<br>
I have given myself a couple of weeks to tryout your "Noticing" method!
<br>
The concept sounded plausible and logical when I first read it and now after 2 weeks of trying out your method I can positively say I've had some progress.
<br>
<br>
I have always been aware that something is happening behind my closed eyelids.  I always just interpreted them as memory flashes and not associating that with vision!  But I believe memory has a close relationship with visualization.  The flashes occurring behind my eyes are so fast I usually just let them go, but by using your technique of "Noticing" I sit back and watch patiently the little snippets of flashes which I now perceive to be speeding images which need controlling by means of relaxing, noticing and being aware.  Eventually what happens is the images become clearer visually and begin to standout some more so than others until there's one dominant image!

There's no doubt about it, I'm definitely progressing but at the moment the images are still quite vague.  Still the best time for me to achieve a more vivid vision is early in the morning just after I've woken up, like before when I was taken to that caravan site in real time watching the birds flying and the trees blowing gently in the breeze.
<br>
<br>
Mind you the visions I now see are static... where's before it was like watching television, now it's like looking at a picture.
<br>
<br>
Not sure the relation but interestingly, yesterday I went and saw a medium, got some problems and was hoping for some answers... the experience was actually quite positive but this is irrelevant. To cut a long story short, he said I poses a great spiritual gift and that I've got something inside me driving me forward on a spiritual path but that momentarily the powers that be have unplugged me and that my energy is virtually depleted and that I should go and see a Reiki healer to reenergize my energy and restore balance, start making decisions and get my life sorted out  That's quite interesting actually because I've noticed the difference in my own ability to heal that the energy just doesn't seem to flow quite like it used to (I'm an NFSH Healer for those that don't know)
<br>
I'm being deprived of energy, I feel resentment... No I don't really.
<br>
<br>
But all this stuff that's going on in my life and the depletion of energy must have an impact on my ability to visualize properly?
<br>
<br>
But Frank, I haven't got to the stage where I am unaware of my physical body.  I believe that to an extent I'm phase shifting my awareness but staying aware of both physical and non physical and not completely going inside myself. Which as you say "is a heck of a tricky mental balancing act to perform".
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your continuing help Frank for it certainly makes a difference.
