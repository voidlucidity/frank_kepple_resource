<section>
There's two people currently on this BBS who have listened to the Wave 1 CD without much progress; and I suspect there may be more who have long since lobbed them to the back of a drawer somewhere, after listening to the CDs without having any real results.
<br>
<br>
Now I find that strange because, for me, the Wave 1 CD has been a very effective tool in my efforts to gain control over the exit process; and to try and work out where Monroe is coming from when he speaks about "phasing in" to the Astral; instead of doing like I used to, for example, which was the feeling of being shot from a cannon and landing within the Astral somewhere; with no real control whatsoever.
<br>
<br>
Now I know myself pretty well by now, and I know for a fact that I do not have any natural talent for this obe stuff. I make the point because someone could say the reason why I am successful, is because I have a natural talent for projection, and so forth. Not a bit. All my gains are hard fought let me assure you. Though, in hindsight, I feel it is because I have no real talent for things of this nature, I've been forced to use my imagination to quite a high degree.
<br>
<br>
It was when I read the following, that I suddenly thought where people may be going wrong:
<br>
<br>
ps : Franks quote :
<br>
"Okay, tell me what are you imagining when you go from the energy conversion box to Focus 3?"
<br>
<br>
In my case, I was trying to concentrate on an image that I could see behind my eyelids, I think that Mr. Jeff Mash mentioned this in one of his posts.
<br>
<br>
Concentrating on an image behind your closed eyelids, and imagining you are going from your Energy Conversion Box to Focus 3: are entirely *different* things.
<br>
<br>
You see, the Wave 1 CD does not in any way "induce" the obe state. In other words you cannot simply lie back, think of any old thing, and 10 minutes down the line you float out of the room. All the CD does is to provide an outline structure, and *you* have to provide the infill. But that's what makes it so effective. The way you provide that infill, is to use your imagination.
<br>
<br>
What I thought I'd do (excuse the length) is to give you a rundown of my experience that demonstrates what I mean. Personally, I'm surprised at the lack of support information supplied by TMI. I would have thought some kind of similar rundown example would have been supplied with the CDs. This would at least give people an example to work from, which they could just chop and change to suit.
<br>
<br>
Okay, here goes.............
<br>
<br>
Wave 1, CD1, Track 2:
<br>
<br>
OCEAN SURF
<br>
<br>
Place physical body in a relaxed position, take a few deep breaths and check head and neck is comfy and properly supported. Then I imagine my sense of conscious awareness is drifting upwards to the top of my consciousness cone.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: I posted before about how I imagine my consciousness to be a cone with everyday thoughts, actions, etc., at the bottom of the cone: with the start of the Astral at the top.
<br>
<br>
GO NOW TO YOUR ENERGY CONVERSION BOX
<br>
<br>
I time it so that when I imagine I reach the top of the cone, Monroe says the above.
<br>
<br>
At the top of my consciousness cone is an attic room. At the opposite side to which I enter there is a doorway marked "Border to the Astral" in large letters. At the centre of the room is a large wooden box. Standing next to the box is Clive, the butler, who helps me lift the lid of the box and remove my Physical sheathe. We open the lid and inside is a lower area containing any Physical-matter concerns, etc. The upper area has a shelf where my Physical sheathe can lie safely until I next collect it.
<br>
<br>
So I wriggle out of my Physical sheathe to reveal my body of light. Clive takes the sheathe while asking me if I have anything else to deposit in the box (which I hand over as necessary). He lays the sheathe out and we close the heavy lid.
<br>
<br>
I walk through the doorway marked "Border to the Astral" and step outside into the fresh clean air; the sand underfoot is soft and warm; the atmosphere is comforting; everything feels secure and familiar. I look behind and Clive is standing in the doorway wishing me a safe journey. I thank him for his assistance and he closes the door. On the outside of the door is marked "To C1" in large letters.
<br>
<br>
Ahead is a pathway composed of inlaid, white stone slabs that contrast with the golden brown of the sand. The path leads to my resonant-tuning pyramid. It's a pyramid structure, but with a flat top about ten feet square and around 10 feet in height. Each of the four sides has steps from top to bottom. The structure is made of the same stone as the pathway and, to the right of the pyramid, is a large golden-coloured harp.
<br>
<br>
BEGIN NOW YOUR PROCESS OF RESONANT TUNING
<br>
<br>
I time it so that as Monroe instructs the above, I begin climbing the steps to the top of my resonant-tuning pyramid. I sit in the Lotus position, on a large cushion, on the flat top. A helper appears to play the harp and pick the strings that resonate with the sounds on the CD. The whole area vibrates and sings in harmony. Ripples of joy run through me as each string is plucked and my body of light tingles and glows a pure white.
<br>
<br>
NOW RELAX AND BREATHE NORMALLY
<br>
<br>
At the point where Monroe says the above, I walk down the front steps of the pyramid, take a few more steps forward, and stand on a large inlaid, white stone slab marked "Declaration Stone". As I do so, a white mist appears in front of me. When it clears, I see a large round structure has arisen from the sand. I walk down the path to a door marked "Declaration Room".
<br>
<br>
I enter the room and I'm right away flanked by two Saintly-looking people each dressed in a pure white silk robe. In front of me is a large crystal Orb that is glowing with an orange/yellow light. Both sides of the Orb, facing me, are 2 more Saint like people that stand as official witnesses to my declaration.
<br>
<br>
I take a bow and give my declaration. As I do so the Orb begins to pulsate. The colour changes and becomes progressively less orange turning to a brighter and brighter yellow. Then it becomes a pure white as I come to the end of my declaration. At this moment, a door opens to my right. I'm ushered to this doorway and look out. On the ground to my left is a pointed sign, saying "To Focus 3" in large letters. Looking in the direction of the sign I can see the Focus 3 archway in the distance. At the same time, Monroe says, "Now you will move to Focus 3."
<br>
<br>
Now Monroe starts the count to Focus 3:
<br>
<br>
While Monroe is talking, I'm acknowledging what he is saying while walking down the stone path towards the F3 archway. I stand on a stone slab and I look down and see, deeply and clearly engraved in the stone is, "F1". (Note: this action is timed with the CD, like always.) I acknowledge the engraving on the slab by looking at it for a few moments, and then continue walking. Next I come across another similar slab, only this time the engraving on the stone says, "F2".
<br>
<br>
Then I walk forwards towards the F3 archway.
<br>
<br>
I time it so that as I stand under the large archway, Monroe says, "3" followed by, "relax and enjoy...." etc. At which point I turn around and look back down the path and see the Declaration Room where I just came from. Then I turn to settle into a large reclining chair that is under the archway. I sit down and look into the distance. I can see my F10 hut sitting on top of a plateau area. A steadily inclining white stone pathway leads to my F10 hut.
<br>
<br>
I relax into the chair and recline it. As I do so, a female helper appears.
<br>
<br>
Now Monroe starts the relaxation process starting, "Let your jaw relax......" As Monroe directs, the female helper massages my head and facial area while I just lie back and enjoy!
<br>
<br>
As Monroe begins saying about letting the relaxation process flow into the brain, I get up and thank my helper and she wishes me a successful journey. Now I stand outside the archway looking across to my F10 hut. I Look down and wiggle my toes as Monroe begins saying, "into your toes.........." etc. As Monroe talks about the relaxation flow from the brain, I imagine myself slowly filling up with a kind of liquid that makes me feel vibrant and totally in tune with my surroundings.
<br>
<br>
I'M GOING TO COUNT NOW
<br>
<br>
Now I begin walking along the white stone path towards my F10 hut. Monroe says, "4" and I time it so that, at that point, I'm standing on a slab engraved with "F4" in large letters at the top. I look down and acknowledge that I am at F4 by looking at the engraved figures for a few moments. Then, still standing still on the slab, I do the observation and relaxation exercises as Monroe prompts.
<br>
<br>
Then I walk forwards some more, and I time it so that when Monroe says, "5" I'm standing on a slab marked "F5". There I do the exercises Monroe suggests, then do the same with, "6"; "7" and "8". First acknowledge the engraving on the slab; do the exercises as per Monroe's prompting; and when Monroe is silent between counts, continue walking down the path. (Obviously it takes a short while to learn the CD and get the timing absolutely right.)
<br>
<br>
After "9" I continue up the path and arrive at the foot of some stone steps, which lead upwards to the plateau on which my F10 hut is situated. I walk up the steps and see, about 30 yards ahead, is the entrance to my F10 hut. Between this is another embedded stone slab engraved with a large "F10" at the top. I walk forwards, stand on the slab and look down acknowledging the engraved "F10". At this moment, Monroe says, "10". Then I go through the prompted exercise, just like before with the previous slabs.
<br>
<br>
Then Monroe repeats the number "10" several times, during which I'm walking towards the entrance of my F10 hut. I open the door, enter the hut, and close the door behind me. I stand for a moment and Monroe says, "Relax and be calm and comfortable in Focus 10".
<br>
<br>
On the opposite wall to the door I came in, is a large opening through which is Focus 12 (and on to the Astral proper). The scene through the opening is like a clear night sky, with the deep blackness punctuated by millions of stars and planets. Sometimes I just stand and admire the view, listening to Monroe's voice on the CD. Or I may leave the hut and fly around. But not too far as it's easy to get carried away and lose the fact that this is an exercise. (The return from which is very important for the exercise as a whole.)
<br>
<br>
The return:
<br>
<br>
On one wall of my F10 hut is a door marked "Direct Return to C1" On Monroe's prompt, "You will return now to full Physical waking reality, as I count from 10 down to 1" I open the door, walk through into the large tunnel and close the door behind me.
<br>
<br>
I'M GOING TO COUNT NOW
<br>
<br>
Then Monroe says, "10" and I look at the door I just walked through, seeing it has "Entry to F10" written on it, in large letters. Then I start jogging down the tunnel and come to a door marked with a large figure "9". I quickly go through it (no need to close as it's spring loaded). Jogging along the descending tunnel I come to a similar door marked "8" then "7" then "6" and onto doorways 5, 4 and 2. (Have to be quick here as Monroe doesn't give you much time, but this does greatly add to the effect).
<br>
<br>
Going through doorway "2" I see the opening of the tunnel. I emerge next to the C1 door I stepped out of originally. The C1 door is open and Clive is beckoning me to hurry. He has my Physical sheathe ready which I step into quickly. He welcomes me back and asks if I'd like to take anything else from the box. I say, "Leave it, no time" and I descend quickly to ordinary waking consciousness at the bottom of my consciousness cone. This happens just after Monroe says, "1". (I always think, "Phew, just made it!")
<br>
<br>
Monroe then prompts, "wake up, open your eyes........" etc. So I do as prompted, in that I actually open my eyes, breathe deeply, and stretch my legs and arms, exactly as Monroe instructs.
<br>

<section>
nice one Frank - we do appreciate the time you put into that post !!
<br>
<br>
Even though I did feel I had some success in trying to project after using the CD a few times, I suspect that this was just coincidence, and I posted it because I was quite excited ! The pointers that Jeff Mash suggested (staring at an image) are in no way related to the CD.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for the length and detail, I'll try a similar style of approaching the exercises and keep everyone posted on any progress.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Great post
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; Thanks for that and your time!
<br>
<br>
I need to go through the details, but one thing is immediately apparent, and that is the great importance of symbolism and imagination in Astral work.
<br>
<br>
As I said in a previous post, imagination isn't something that people have a figment of exactly - imagination is an attribute of the Spirit, necessary for creating out of the Astral substance. Imagination becomes the reality.
<br>
<br>
Symbolism is also very powerful - indeed - much of the bible was originally symbolism, which the writers took literally as occuring in the material world. But people do project through symbols of e.g. the elements, or realms which have fixed symbols such a silver cauldron, golden apples etc..
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
with best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hi Frank,
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Seems you got a lot out of the tapes, and I like how you've used the imagination in those experiences.
</p>
<p>
 I never got much further than focus 10 using the tapes. I'm not very good at trance induction methods, but focus 10 has always been pretty interesting and consistent in the way I experience it.
</p>
<p>
 I used to call it the "white socks" space, because it felt so fluffy, wispy and misty, and I often would myself looking down through my eyelids seeing my socks. I could also look around me with my eyes closed. No vibrations were present and I never succeeded in leaving the body from this state while otherwise I have no problems, which I found interesting, since I think one is supposed to be able until focus 12.
</p>
<p>
 Never been in it long enough to really expeirment with the imagination, but for me it's always been very closely related to the physical, even though sense of my real body, and all sensory information has disappeared. Maybe I should start again with the tapes again one day.
</p>

<section>
Frank,
<br>
Thank you so much for the extra detail. That kind of detail is much needed and appreciated.
<br>
I particularly liked your idea of putting your physical body in the energy conversion box.
<br>
But let me ask you: what do you do during the resonant tuning? Do you actually hum along like RM says?
<br>
<br>
Thanks
<br>
<br>

<section>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, I make a sound that resonates with the CD and the harp. But it's imaginary not literally.
<br>
<br>
Also, could I please reiterate what Adrian has said in his last post. Imagination is a very powerful tool that is not of the Physical body.
<br>
<br>
Well, all the lower stuff is such as doubt and fear. In the sense that someone might imagine something is going to turn out bad, so they begin to fear the outcome, and so on. But when you clear out all that stuff, you get to see (or sense) the higher imagination. Which is all very visual and more abstract. This kind of imagination is very Astral oriented.
<br>
<br>
As I keep saying, the Astral is right there on border of the upper reaches of your imagination. That's why the stronger you imagine, the closer the point comes where you actually project your focal point of awareness into whatever it is you are imagining. At which point you find yourself standing within the Astral. You don't have to travel anywhere, or create anything to get to it. It's right there

<br>

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your excellent detail on these experiences.
<br>
<br>
And yes - imagination is an extremely powerful attribute of the Spirit, and source of creation in the Astral realms. I think people might be afraid to use imagination, thinking it is not real, or a "figment", but it is
<b>
 very
</b>
real, and very powerful.
<br>
<br>
Frank: Could I ask you this - when you are "in" the Astral, either from your early morning OBE and/or from your focus 10 work, can you sense your physical body, e.g. arms, legs, feet etc.., or do they just sort of blend intothe background and effectively become unnoticable? I suspect alot of people might be put off from higher states due to the constant awareness of their pysical state - pressures of sitting, pins and needles, itches etc..
<br>
<br>
The question - are you totally absorbed and at one with the Astral experience to the point where you are unaware of your physical body and its position? I am particularly interested from the Focus 10 perspective, since that is more like meditation than an OBE in absolute terms.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>

Adrian.

With me, the big stumbling block was trusting that my imagination was reaching out to somewhere. That's where faith comes into it quite a bit. At first, you are lying there going through the process on the CD, but you can still feel your physical body. And the feeling of your imagination feels weak by comparison.
<br>
<br>
Hence it is so very tempting to think, "Oh, this is stupid, this 'aint gonna work." But after going through the process a couple of hundred times, the contact you have with your imagination becomes far more powerful than the Physical. Well, under those relaxed circumstances when you are practising I mean. You don't want to be driving to work and suddenly the Astral side of things takes over.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
The turning point comes when you get all the timing right (it was with me, at any rate). That's when the whole thing takes on a life of its own.

I like the phrase, "blend into the background". Before I was struggling to try and explain to you the feeling of this new-found projection process. I said it felt more like the scenery had changed, rather than bodies. But, then again, there is an awareness that you are not exactly in your physical body. But the physical body is always kinda there somehow.
<br>
<br>
I see it now like a revolving door. Turn it 180degs and the person at the back is now at the front, turn it another 180degs and the opposite is the case. It's like you change your phasing and the one at the front sees all the action and the one at the back sits quiet. Then the phasing changes.

From the Focus10 perspective, I have an awareness that, down the corridor, is a physical body. I can feel it if I want to, or not if I don't.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your explanations - most useful and interesting!
<br>
<br>
I think you really have something here - something potentially far more meaningful than a conventional OBE. By raising your awareness, or "focus" to the Astral level in this way, and being attached rather than detached as it were from the experience, I would think that it is far more objective and most importantly you can bring back full recall.
<br>
<br>
Question: Are you an observer from the "focus" perspective, or can you fully interact with the environment and the people there, e.g. your guide?
<br>
<br>
You should also find that you are not limited to the Astral. You should be able to raise your awareness to the Mental, Celestial and eventually Cosmic levels of consciousness, and the Astral will not seem the same again then.
<br>
<br>
The thing with the Astral is that that the people there are the same as the people here, same attitudes, outlook, desires etc., except they are discarnate. That is one reason why they are still in the Astral of course, until they can rid themslves of the earthly materialism, passions and desires. Beyond the Astral the Spiritual knowledge available is incredible.
<br>
<br>
Another very real possibility for the Astral however is to contact the higher intelligences there who can impart some truly advanced knowledge. These intelligences are responsible for almost every aspect of the evolution of mankind, and have vast genuine knowldege between them. Also of course, there are the beings of the single elements who can impart vast knowledge regarding the element to which they belong.
<br>
<br>
Apologies for the rambling - but the point I am trying to make is that once controlled Astral level work is possible with full recall, the possibilities of using it as a launchpad for greater progression is immense.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Yes, because there is no feeling of detachment from the physical-body it feels, in a sense, like one continuous process. So there isn't any great hole that your memories fall through (as they used to, with me, when I did things the old way).

Yes, I can fully interact but, when listening to the CD, I curtail my actions as it's so easy to go off and forget I'm invoved in a training exercise. Sometimes I can't wait for the CD to finish whereupon I zip back to F10 and project freely.

  You should also find that you are not limited to the Astral. You should be able to raise your awareness to the Mental, Celestial and eventually Cosmic levels of consciousness, and the Astral will not seem the same again then.

I use the term "Astral" as a general term that, to me, describes any projection I may have. From one of your other posts. I now realise the true earthly meaning of the word. Thing is, all the "beings" I met on the Astral are just people at the end of the day.
<br>
<br>
My regular guide, Harath, for example, is not of this physical Earth. But he's a nice helpful guy who is trying to expand my (rather limited) mind. For which I am grateful.

  The thing with the Astral is that that the people there are the same as the people here, same attitudes, outlook, desires etc., except they are discarnate. That is one reason why they are still in the Astral of course, until they can rid themslves of the earthly materialism, passions and desires. Beyond the Astral the Spiritual knowledge available is incredible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another very real possibility for the Astral however is to contact the higher intelligences there who can impart some truly advanced knowledge. These intelligences are responsible for almost every aspect of the evolution of mankind, and have vast genuine knowldege between them. Also of course, there are the beings of the single elements who can impart vast knowledge regarding the element to which they belong.

Yes, you come across those people who are discarnate. In the sense that they had, and now do not have, a physical sheathe. But, along the line, you get to meet those who have never been incarnate on this physical Earth. It's kinda freaky at first, especially as they are just as curious about you; as you are curious about them.

  nice one Frank - we do appreciate the time you put into that post !!

  Even though I did feel I had some success in trying to project after using the CD a few times, I suspect that this was just coincidence, and I posted it because I was quite excited ! The pointers that Jeff Mash suggested (staring at an image) are in no way related to the CD.

<br>
<br>
I should mention right away that I have never tried any of those CD's, so I hope that my example of 'looking at an image' didn't sound like I was trying to sum up Monroe's process.  It's just the technique I use.
<br>
<br>
However, although my description was simpler, I find that I utilize a lot of the SAME techniques that Frank does, just in my own way.
<br>
<br>
For example, when I first lay down to project, I have to deal with a lot of THOUGHTS. This is because my mind is till buzzing with all the thoughts that I've been focusing on in my physical, day-to-day life.
<br>
<br>
"Who is going to win American Idol?"
<br>
"I wonder what work will be like tomorrow."
<br>
"What am I going to do for my birthday this Sunday?"
<br>
etc......
<br>
<br>
After I QUIET my thoughts, I end up seeing fleeting images.  My mind is still a bit active, but the thoughts turn to quick images.
<br>
<br>
"Oh look...bright color!"
<br>
"Hey, that looked like a fish or something!"
<br>
"Are those stars?"
<br>
<br>
As you can see, I've now moved into a point where I'm no longer concentrating on my day-to-day thoughts, but I moved into a more visual, abstract mindset.
<br>
<br>
After this, my mind begins to quiet as my body goes to sleep, and the images become more stable.  Instead of seeing a quick flash of something which looks like a bird or a book, the image remains there longer.  My mind no longer says, "Wow, look at how real this image appears!"  Instead, it passively acknowledges that it's travelling further and further up the "consciousness cone."  This is what Frank talks about....the stronger  your imagination becomes, the closer you are to the astral.
<br>
<br>
The stronger these images become, two things happen for me:
<br>
<br>
1) They remain longer in my field of vision (without disappearing or changing)
<br>
2) They start to take on a three dimensional aspect
<br>
<br>
I believe it is at this point that you can melt into the background, or phase your surroundings to step right into the astral.  Usuaully, what happens to me, is that I lose consciousness for a specific amount of time (sometimes seconds, sometimes hours).....at which point, I quickly SNAP back to my conscious awareness.  My body is completely asleep, but my mind is wide awake (thanks to the process I went through in the previous paragraphs).
<br>
<br>
From there, I'm aware that I'm in my room still, and I simply roll out and find myself in the RTZ.  I have two current goals:
<br>
<br>
1) Don't lose consciousness, but simply meld into the astral by shifting my awareness.  This would bypass the RTZ altogether.
<br>
<br>
2) Contact my guide/higher self, no matter which plane I find myself in (astral, RTZ, etc).
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I notice a lot of similarities between my technique and Franks, so I thought I would share that with you guys (and gals!).

Clive?  A butler?  How British!  Hee!
<br>
<br>
Thank you Frank, for this post.  It demonstrates an important point, that although you advise us that the Astral is as close as next door, that doesn't necessarily mean you can "blip" there on a whim.  You are as advanced a projector as this forum has seen in awhile, and your personal ritual is pretty extensive.  It gives the rest of us an idea for how to improve our own half-a**ed methods.  I mean, no WONDER I'm having such difficulty; my imagination is nowhere near as engaged as yours.
<br>
<br>
Something else, I'd like to throw out, in case someone might be able to use it:  I use the Gateway CD, and I find that I need more time to do the exercises than Mr. Monroe allows, because I have trouble with my imagination.  For instance, my energy bubble is only half-formed when he moves on to the next part.  I've found that, after playing the CD, repeating the Gateway  exercises with a Theta-wave CD (a long one, lasting over 1 hour), I can take as long as I need to with the imagery, and move on to the next part when I am ready.  I still use the Gateway CD for the "brain-training" though.

Does anyone think if this imagination process could be used with one of the music hemi-sync cd's or other music/nature cd's? This process is different than what I try/experience, however it may take me beyond my usual stopping point, since I do not get much of astral vision, only a glimpse of a vision change starting, maybe imagination would allow me to leap across.

During the few years I practiced remote viewing three times a week, I used two of the Hemi-Sync music tapes over and over.  One was named 'Higher' and the other was named 'Winds over the World'.  Although I cannot say exactly what brainwave mixes these entrained me to, they did seem helpful in calming me and producing a reliable physical state, allowing me to focus on the work I was attempting to do.
<br>
<br>
Each of the Hemi-Sync musical numbers is set up for a different mix of frequencies, so the one you choose may matter to that degree.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I didn't mean to imply that all the beings in the Astral are discarnate people passed over from Earth on their way to higher realms. My suggestion was that those that are from Earth are still very "Earthly" in their outlook and actions, and which is why they are still in the Astral, and have limited or no profound incremental knowledge.
<br>
<br>
As you rightly point out however, there are
<b>
 many
</b>
other beings in the Astral realms who are not previously from Earth. Such beings are the beings of the single Elements - Sylph's, Undines, Salamanders and Gnomes  - all symbolic representations for very real and important beings, and then there are the very high intelligences of the sphere who are working with the high authorities on the progress of mankind - there are not many of them, but they are extremely powerful and possess incredible knowledge. They are also contactable and will impart that knowledge if appropriate.
<br>
<br>
Of course the Astral and higher Spiritual realms are a continuum  - unlike the physical universe which has suns, planets, solar systems, galaxies etc.., and accordingly all Astral life previously from the physical universe, as well as those that are there more permanently, live together in one large "realm" in accordance with their degree of "perfection" and possibly other factors which might or might not be the case with Harath - e.g. they are their to help.  There are numerous physical planets with human like beings, and when such beings end their physical lives, they go to the same places as humans and presumably all live together as one large family of Souls at the same level of Spiritual progression. Such beings as Angels are on an entirely different evolutionary path to human beings.
<br>
<br>
I would be most interested to here where Harath is from if you can ever find out, or whether he is a permanent Astral resident, there to assist.
<br>
<br>
The point is though, once these realms can be visited, and the experience controlled and remembered, the information and knowledge gained can be profound.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
<br>

With kind regards,
<br>
<br>

The whole thrust behind my thinking is to try and work out what Monroe meant when he writes about "phasing in" to the Astral as opposed to the traditional out of body experience.
<br>
<br>
I tried the rope-trick ages ago, but got bored with it. Climbing the same old rope every morning became too much of a burden. This way is far more involving and much more of a mental challenge to get right.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
One thing I am still somewhat unclear about is this statement:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote id="quote">
 <font face='"Arial"' id="quote" size="1">
  quote:
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
  <br>
  Yes, I can fully interact but, when listening to the CD, I curtail my actions as it's so easy to go off and forget I'm invoved in a training exercise. Sometimes I can't wait for the CD to finish whereupon I zip back to F10 and project freely.
  <br>
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
If you can fully interact and achieve everything you could previously achieve, and with the immense benefit of complete recall, why is it you that you
<b>
 "can't wait for the CD to finish whereupon I zip back to F10 and project freely."
</b>
<br>
<br>
From what you have been saying about the Focus method, I can't understand why you would be in such a hurry to go back your old, traditional method?
<br>
<br>
Anyway, we should I think be very mindful of the fact that originally Monroe was an exponent of traditional Astral projection. I believe his method involved "reaching out" for the vibrations and pulling them into your body.
<br>
<br>
<b>
 However
</b>
: We are grateful to Monroe for founding his institute, and conducting a huge amount of research ito the subject of "consciousness" and spefically raising consciousness and awareness to the realms beyond the physical. It seems to me at least that Monroe made massive strides in progress in these areas, and hence the hemi-sync, focus levels and so on, and which were clearly way beyond traditional Astral projection for the reason we have discussed here. The reasons include much more objectivity and control, and most of all complete memory recall, without which the experience is almost meaningless.
<br>
<br>
That is why I am so interested in Frank's work. He has experience of traditional OBE and its limitations, and has now followed the same path as Monroe before him, and discovered a whole new level of obtaining reeal meaning from the whole higher consciousness experience. And after all, is that not the objective? Unless of course people are pursuing Astral projection for purely novelty and recreational purposes - which is fine if that is what people want. But there is a vast amount of valuable knowledge and experience to be gained from the realms beyond the physical, and surely the objective must be to make the most of them?
<br>
<br>
I apologise to Frank in advance if I have misunderstood.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I dont look at these CD's as a way to Astrally Project, for me they are a way of re-training the brain.   Because my brain wont let me past all my accumulated beliefs, I think the affirmation is a great way of getting through that fear barrier - the whole CD is like training wheels.  I have only been OBE once and only for a second, rope trick doesn't work.  I know nothing about Monroe but I have experienced a lot of 'interesting things' which I directly relate to the CD.  I have to settle for that for the time being.

<br>
WOW ! how Wonderfull that all this has come about from "Okay, tell me what are you imagining when you go from the energy conversion box to Focus 3?" Quite frankly I hadn't Imagined much of anything except the Energy convertion box which I invisioned as a golden pirate chest, beyond that I had put my wories of the day inside and like you had imagined pulling my physical body sheath off and adding it to the box. but beyond that I had pretty much just followed Monroe along with the resonant-tuning hummiing along and so on without getting much more than some hypnogogic images from behind my eyelids. Well after thinking of your question of what I imagened while listening to the cd's the very next time I listened to Orentation and Focus 10 when I got to the resonant-tuning I was listening instead of humming along and seeing nothing but blackness behind my eyelids when a strange thing happened..I saw a man sitting in a black reclineing chair, he had a neatly trimed jet black beard and mustache with nicely trimed sideburns and  was rather stout and balding only on the top of his head, he had kind of a english manner to his voice (if you have seen a show called sliders there is a man who resembles this man somewhat on that show) the resonant tuning was going on in the background at the time and as I looked at him he said " You don't really think those voices are real do you?" ........and then my darn dog got up and Shook! breaking my concentration. It was such a pity. I sure would have liked to have been able to respond. ....N E way Thanks so much for the insight, I dont' suppose anyone else has seen this guy

<br>
Adrian: Either you misunderstood, or I didn't make myself clear enough.
<br>
<br>
I can no-longer project my "old way". Not sure exactly why that is, though, thinking about it in computer-software terms, it feels like the new version of Windows has overwritten the old version. So I cannot boot using the old version anymore.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays, when going through the exercise to Focus 10 and back, I often start to slip into what I call "countdown to projection" mode. I'll begin seeing whirls of foggy colour and abstract images (stray energy stage) which I use as a milestone that tells me projection within the Astral is just about to happen. Which is all very nice. Because to be able to do that with such relative ease *is* what I have been working on the past six months.
<br>
<br>
However, I do like to be thorough. And it is the very fact that I have been so thorough, that has got me to this stage. Plus, it is also a question of control and mental discipline. Not only that, I am (as yet) nowhere near achieving my goal of achieving repeated, controlled conscious-exit projections with the ease Monroe writes about. Basically, I want to be able to just lie back, take a few deep breaths and "phase in".
<br>
<br>
The mental imagery, coupled with the use of the CD, may seem (to some) to be a bit long winded. But one glaring aspect of projection has come about from my work, and that is:
<i>
 you have to learn to project slowly, before you can project quick
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
Consider also that when doing it
<i>
 without
</i>
the CD, you can run through the process in just as much detail but in *half* the time. Plus, it is possible to add further refinements such as my "fast track" declaration process. Which works very well. I enter the declaration room as before and, instead of reading the declaration out loud, I'm handed a form to sign. The declaration is written out on the form. I read it through, agree and sign, then the door opens and off I go to Focus 3.
<br>
<br>
Oh, I spoke to Harath this morning. Not much happened. For some reason he was making me do all these sight exercises. He'd cause different shapes to come up on a wall about 20 feet away and I had to say what they were. Such as red triangle, blue circle and so on. I asked him where he was from and his exact reply was, "Where I'm from is not important" and he just kept insisting we do these darned exercises. Next thing this "school minibus" drove up with a load of children inside and I had to help him usher them into "school" after which I had to leave (physical-body demand).

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Yes, I confess I did misunderstand regarding your "old" projection technique.
<br>
<br>
But OTOH, as I implied before, I think you could well be following a course which should rapidly lead to controlled, extended, objective and memorable Astral work at will. This would be a very great achievement for sure.
<br>
<br>
I am very interested in what the swirls and stray energy look like in more detail, and how long it takes to manifest an turn into something more Astral.
<br>
<br>
As for the excercises of Harath - most interesting! It sounds very like the technique used to project into (through a symbil) the kingdoms of the single elements - Fire, Water, Air and Earth. These are the elements from which everything in the Universe (all realms) was created, and from which the electric and magnetic fluids originate. Of course these fluids and the elements are
<b>
 not
</b>
the same as the physical things, but analogous to them. All creation started with heat and expansion from the element of Fire, which has as its primary characteristics heat and light.
<br>
<br>
But I diversify - by projecting, or entering into the kingdoms of the elements through the symbol analogous to each - you can meet and interact with the beings of the single elements - Sylphs (Air), Undines (Water), Salamanders (Fire) and Gnomes (Earth), and these beings are very useful to know!
<br>
<br>
I am just guessing of course, and might be completely wrong

http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt; Maybe it was just some sort of objectivity test excercise?
<br>

Hey Frank -
<br>
<br>
I am so
<b>
 incredibly
</b>
grateful for you sharing your technique and to Jeff Mash too for the different angle.  I did the Monroe Tapes for a long while before I realised that they were missing all the most important instructions for actually projecting!  (NOT impressed!!!)
<br>
<br>
I really think that your personal technique is such an important addendum that I think it would be great if you could make an article out of what you've written so far.  I just think that otherwise the postings might be difficult to find.  (And I had a hard time finding your previous posting on the cone of consciousness too.)
<br>
<br>
Bloody awesome stuff!!!
<br>
<br>
Cheers!

Gateway Gateway Gateway. In the past Iv'e used other similiar guided meditations like William Buhlmans 4 tape set (very good), Transcendance by Hemi Sync and Mind voyage Astral Trance (good for loosening up from the body). They kept me motivated and I eventually had a few oob's. Some woman on another site recommended Wave 3 to me but Hemi sync refused to sell it to me until I went through the other Waves.
<br>
<br>
So after reading these posts I became curious and recently ordered Gateway 1 1-6. So far I like them,  will be able to stick to a once a day meditation. They are worth the money, having 6 different meditations on 3 cd's for $99.00.
<br>
<br>
If you patiently use them like Frank and don't expect them to magically project you instantaneously, you won't go wrong.

Greetings WEIRDZLY!
<br>
<br>
Yes, you make some excellent points.
<br>
<br>
If people expect to load the CD, put on their headphones and zap into the Astral, they will be disappointed I am sure. But if they are used as long term tools for raising consciousness, and eventually maintaining that level of consciousness without the help of the CD's, I am sure it could be worthwhile.

Frank:
<br>
Thank you very much for posting this. Looks like I was totally wrong in my approach. I only used my imagination a little bit, but I always kept my consciousness near my physical body, and would always do a check to see if I could still feel my body or not. I really like the walking away from the body approach.
<br>
I have 3 questions for you:
<br>
1. When you do the imagining, do you imaging in a third or first person view? I try to imagine in a first person view, but it always seems like I am imagining me watching myself walk everywhere.
<br>
2. Do you do this laying down or sitting up?
<br>
3. How often do you fall asleep while doing these exercises? Did you fall asleep a lot at first and gradually remain conscious?
<br>
<br>
I tried your approach last and and ended up falling asleep at the declaration part. I had been out of town and was travelling that day, so I think it was a combination of laying down and being a little travel tired. I might start doing the exercises in the computer room on a lazy boy chair. What do you think?

Good, you have managed to locate your focal point of consciousness. The point at which you are, when you are looking at yourself doing whatever it is you happen to be doing, is your focal point of consciousness. Ideally, this should be within the body of light (or whatever style body it is you are imagining) but it doesn't matter if it's a bit half and half.
<br>
<br>
Note: You don't want to be trying too hard with the visualisation aspect. You need to keep things slightly on the abstract side otherwise you begin to engage in an act of creative visualisation, rather than Astral projection.
<br>
<br>
The key thing is to keep that focal point of consciousness, or awareness, as far away from the Physical as possible. Which is, ultimately, the whole idea of having the rundown to Focus 10 and back. In that it gives you an exercise in deliberately taking your focal point of consciousness away from the Physical, and then bring it back again. As Monroe says, the more you do this the more natural it becomes.

Laying down in bed, early morning. But now I'm starting to practice the exercise, without the CD, at various times in the day just sitting in a comfy chair. I find I am more aware of my physical body during daytime. But I'm hoping, with practice, that will change. Ultimately I'm trying to reach the stage where surroundings/time of day/etc. make no difference.

Falling asleep can be a problem if you do this at night before normal sleeptime. That's one reason why I practice early morning, and now at additional times during the day.

Hi there guys...
<br>
<br>
Frank, sorry to keep bothering you !
<br>
"Note: You don't want to be trying too hard with the visualisation aspect. You need to keep things slightly on the abstract side otherwise you begin to engage in an act of creative visualisation, rather than Astral projection."
<br>
<br>
I'm planning to use the wave 1 CD over the next few months, with the pointers that you've already given...obviously I'll be making changes to the scenario that you outline at the beginning of the post, so that it is more personalised.
<br>
<br>
Can you elaborate a little on the "creative visualization" distinction you mention above ? At the moment, I'm not sure how I could tell whether :
<br>
a) I had shifted my focal point of awareness, or
<br>
b) I was actually just doing some "creative visualisation"
<br>
<br>
Obviously, I don't want to get 3 or 4 months into the CD, to find I've been going down the wrong path !
<br>
cheers

<br>
<br>
At first it will automatically be abstract enough. All I mean is keep it fairly simple so it flows along with the CD, but if you happen to get a few blank parts that don't quite add up then that's okay. The circumstances that you imagine around you will be fairly fluid, expect that. Don't try and make the whole process exactly the same each time so it becomes robotic.
<br>
<br>
Robert Bruce had problems, for example, with the ROPE technique. He'd have people who would bang their heads on the ceiling, or who would end up with a huge pile of rope on the floor, and so forth. The mistake they were making is to take the technique too literally.

<br>
Jouni, yes, that is correct. Although it won't feel like that in the beginning because a large part of it will still be reading physical-body signals. However, by practicing these kinds of visualisation exercises, you gradually learn to shift that focal point of consciousness more and more away from the physical body.

<section>
Greetings!
<br>
<br>
We will let Frank answer the visualisation versus AP question.
<br>
<br>
But there is plenty of room for confusion here for sure
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;
<br>
<br>
When asking people to use their "imagination", it is easy to think that what you have to do is to make the whole thing up in your mind as you go along - like a fantasy. I.e. you just create the journey in your mind according to what you want to do, and it accordingly remains in your mind and not an objective interaction with the Astral at all - i.e. its all made up, of a figment.
<br>
<br>
This is a difficult one. Imagination is an attribute of the Spirit, so when you imagine something you are actually creating the image in the Astral itself. That does not of course mean that you are actually participating, or doing anymore than creating imagry from the Astral substance. This is where it can get very confusing.
<br>
<br>
As I understand Frank's latest methodology - he is using the hemi-sync CD to achieve the appropriate level of "trance", and then using imagination as a gateway to the Astral proper. So initially the imagination is real to the extent that it is actually creating Astral imagry, but is only being used to create a door into the Astral.
<br>
<br>
I assume, and I am sure Frank will confirm (or deny) this, but as soon as you pass through the doorway your have created with your imagination, you then enter an objective (to the extent the possible) Astral realm and place, where everything that you see, and everything that is happening, and the people you meet are very real, and are always there, and that you can interact fully with this environmentt. I.e At that point you cease to create the imagry in the Astral in your mind, and start to become a part of the Astral.
<br>
<br>
This is one reason I am suggesting the new forum. I recognise the great importance of these issues, completely separately from "OBE", and accordingly they should be kept separate from the OBE and AP fora.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<br>
<br>
It is all to do with the end goal.
<br>
<br>
The end goal, here, is not to create an absolutely perfect imaginary scenario that aligns completely with the CD to the n'th extent: that is totally repeatable in every way, each time you run through it.
<br>
<br>
Logic and reason, while being advantageous faculties to have, can get in the way if applied too literally to obe work.

<section>
Frank and Adrian, again, thank you very much. This means a lot to me.
<br>
<br>
Alright, I think I am understanding what you are saying.
<br>
1. Basically, use your imagination but don't go overboard trying to imagine a "perfect" scene. I usually don't do that anyways.
<br>
2. It doesn't matter if you imagine yourself in a third or first person view, but a FPV is ideal.
<br>
<br>
Now, when does it happen where you are actually "in" the Astral and not imagining anymore? Does it somehow happen "magically," or is there a better way to bring it on?
<br>
Here's another thing I was thinking. You seem to be taking to TMI's "Focus" word pretty literally (I don't mean that in a bad way), so I started thinking about F10 and 12. Do you go back to F10 (without the CD) by just imagining you are walking through your Focus markers and getting to where you are at the F10, and by this time you have focused your attention and "feeling" in that "place" and are now, by definition, "in" F10? The same for F12 would be just getting to your F10 hut and then walking through the door to the F12 space scene?
<br>
I hope I am not way off, because, if this is correct, I might now understand what the TMI trainers meant when they said that you could get to all the states while walking around.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, absolutely. That is the whole point of creating the imagery. Otherwise, if Monroe said, "Return to Focus 10" where would you go? What would you do? By having the various mental states linked to particular sets of meta-physical imagery, the answer to the question of what to do (or where to go) next is obvious and immediate.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, yes, absolutely. You are really starting to get the hang of it. The reason why I, personally, have a "space scene" is because F12 is the first stage of expanded awareness where you leave the Physical behind. At F10 I'm still grounded, as it were, in my F10 hut. But the opening in the wall of the hut leads into limitless space.
<br>
<br>
What you can practice is flying out of the opening into the surrounding space while still keeping an eye on the opening you just came through. Then, when Monroe instructs you to return to C1, come back to F10 and go through the return procedure as normal.
<br>
<br>

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not sure exactly how it will happen with yourself. It could happen in a variety of ways. All I can say for definite, is you will KNOW when it happens.
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
<br>
<br>
What I would do is work on getting to the stage where there is a definite difference in feeling when you return to C1. What I mean is, I progressively feel my physical body less and less; such that by the time I settle into my reclining chair at F3, I've normally lost touch with it more or less completely.
<br>
<br>
From then on, the going through the motions of the journey should be the focus of your attention. The feeling is just the same as if your attention was absorbed by watching a favourite movie. Only difference being the movie is being played in the realms of your imagination.
<br>
<br>
I've said before that the Astral is very much closer than I suspect most people realise. It's right there, on the border of your imagination. What this technique does is to provide the framework to enable you to travel within the realms of your imagination. At some point you will reach that border and the Astral will come into view.

<section>
Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Apologies for resurrecting this thread
<img class="bbc_link" href="http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" rel="noopener" src='"&lt;a' target="_blank"/>
http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif" border=0&gt;  But as I said before, I feel absolutely certain that you are on to something here of great value.
<br>
<br>
I just wanted to ask for the benefit of the people following this thread a couple of questions thus:
<br>
<br>
1) In the Astral access "sequence", how real/vivid/plasticly do you need to imagine or "see" the sequences you describe that lead to entering the Astral portal proper, and waving goodbye to the butler, (Clive?) for a time? E.g., can you imagine it like watching an inner TV screen, or do you find it more "hazy" than that and harder to maintain? I think you see the point of the question.
<br>
<br>
2) It is clear that dedication and perseverance is a major factor, and one where people might become despondent if no results are forthcoming.
<br>
<br>
How long did it take you before the Astral portal access sequence progressed from imagination to reality. By reality, I mean to the point where you no longer had to imagine it, but it rather assumed a life of its own, and the Astral environment, as entered through the portal, became solid, real and fluid - i.e. the Astral life proper where everything is happening around you, and you are a part of it, and can interact, communicate, etc...
<br>
<br>
3) Is this Astral experience (via the Astral portal), as vivid and real as your previous OBE experiences - indeed it the same Astral level, people etc.? I also assume that you can retain full recall of the experiences.
<br>
<br>
I ask these things because I have the beginnings of a project in mind - that is all I can say for now. But your valuable input would be most welcome!
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

  1) In the Astral access "sequence", how real/vivid/plasticly do you need to imagine or "see" the sequences you describe that lead to entering the Astral portal proper, and waving goodbye to the butler, (Clive?) for a time? E.g., can you imagine it like watching an inner TV screen, or do you find it more "hazy" than that and harder to maintain? I think you see the point of the question.

<br>
<br>
<br>
At first it is hard to maintain. The tendency is to drift off on some other, more earth-bound thought(s). But this goes away with practise. Having the sequences mapped out on the CD is very helpful tool to practice with. Though if someone wanted to create their own sequence, I guess it would work well too. In which case I would advise them to plan it out carefully. Write down the script, and go through it several times in the Physical first.
<br>
<br>
The technique does not require you to first create the meditive "empty mind" state (though if a person could already do that it would be a bonus). The idea is, you flood your mind with other, more beneficial thoughts, i.e. those more likely to achieve contact with the Astral, as opposed to wondering what you're going to have for breakfast. Ultimately, having some kind of script *is* what keeps your mind focussed on the task in hand.
<br>
<br>
As for how I "see" these images: they are nowhere near as clear and vivid as the images I eventually see when stepping into the Astral realms - these images are as clear as day. It's more like I am sensing an awareness of an image in my mind, rather than seeing the image directly.
<br>
<br>
Astral access sequence is, as follows: I get to Focus 10, and stand in my F10 Hut looking out through the F12 doorway. I generally just stand there gazing at the blackness of the space scene, which is punctuated by all the stars. If nothing happens then I might fly into the blackness and drift about a bit. If still nothing happens then I'll come back to the Hut and stand looking for a while again - then fly off some more.
<br>
<br>
If the next stage (below) has not come about after 20 minutes, or so, then I will return to C1. I'll give it 5 or 10 minutes, go through the countdown to F10 again, and try for full Astral contact once more. (I won't try and force things as doing this is a MAJOR retrograde step.)
<br>
<br>
There comes a point, when I'm standing in the F10 Hut either gazing outwards or just drifting in the blackness, where the blackness takes on a kind of 3D effect (Note: Jeff_M's experiences are similar here so you might find reading over some of his posts helpful).
<br>
<br>
The blackness taking on this 3D effect, seems to be the transition between "sensing an awareness" of the imagery, and seeing the images directly, as clear as day, just like I were looking through my physical eyes. This is also the point where I *totally* lose all sensation of my physical body. (Not that I have much by the time I reach Focus 10 anyway, but there is always this inkling of a feeling until full Astral contact.)
<br>
<br>
First the blackness becomes 3D, followed by a sensation that the blackness is gently swirling around me. Then I normally see whirls of smoky, foggy-looking colours for a few seconds and, sometimes, there is a bright light in the distance which is obscured as it shines through the fog.
<br>
<br>
It is at this stage where I "mark my intent". (On the Astral "Intent" is the energy that drives you into experiencing whatever it is you want to experience.) Which sounds ever so easy to say, but I'm currently finding it difficult to learn. Well, as I've said before, my navigation skills were virtually non-existant and it is only recently that I've started getting the hang of it.
<br>
<br>
Then I find myself projected within the Astral proper.

  2) It is clear that dedication and perseverance is a major factor, and one where people might become despondent if no results are forthcoming.

 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
Yes, you are quite right. But I also found that Belief and Doubt are major factors that determine an individual's progress. Any kind of doubt puts a MAJOR spoke in the works. Belief is also another factor that can hinder (or accelerate) a person's progress.
<br>
<br>
The typical scenario a beginner is faced with is the question, "How can I believe something that doesn't exist?" (When I say "doesn't exist" I mean not existing on physical-plane reality.) As such, a person will naturally doubt the whole thing. Which is where Faith comes into it to a high degree.
<br>
<br>
They may read a book such as AD where aspects of projection are explained in simple, matter of fact terms. This tends to give people confidence in that they too can learn. So they set off just trying some small "energy awareness" technique.
<br>
<br>
Deep down, they are not really fully believing everything that is written, and they doubt whether they will ever be able to experience even half of what RB has written about. But the book has touched them to the extent they have a little Faith in what they are about to do, and naturally they will be curious.
<br>
<br>
All it takes is for them to make just a little progress, and this will have the effect of increasing their Faith and Curiosity. So they go in a little deeper and each time their Faith and Curiosity increases, and with it their doubts begin to fall away.
<br>
<br>
But an individual doesn't necessarily have to take this approach. The simple way to go from Physical A to Astral B, is to 1) Fully and absolutely believe in the possibility, and, 2) Have no doubt that results will be forthcoming. Bit of a tough cookie, I agree.

  How long did it take you before the Astral portal access sequence progressed from imagination to reality. By reality, I mean to the point where you no longer had to imagine it, but it rather assumed a life of its own, and the Astral environment, as entered through the portal, became solid, real and fluid - i.e. the Astral life proper where everything is happening around you, and you are a part of it, and can interact, communicate, etc...
  <br>
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I listened to the CD several hundred times over a period of months. During which time I concocted the imagery for the countdown sequence. It wasn't so much the actual concocting of the imagery that took the time. Thats part of it only took about 2 weeks to perfect, going through the sequence 2 or 3 times each morning. It was the realisation, or the idea, of going through the countdown in that way: which didn't come to me until I'd been listening to the CD for about 2 months.
<br>
<br>
Once I had perfected the imagery process, my progress began to accelerate quite rapidly. Had I initially begun using the CD, coupled with the imagery I am using now, I guess it would have taken me about 3 or 4 weeks before the transition to the Astral would have become a semi-predictable event, say, 6 times in 10 attempts.

  3) Is this Astral experience (via the Astral portal), as vivid and real as your previous OBE experiences - indeed it the same Astral level, people etc.? I also assume that you can retain full recall of the experiences.
  <br>
  <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I really like the term "Astral portal" I'll use that in future, thank you. Yes, even more vivid and even more real. Doing what I used to do, i.e. my Cannonball Projection, is quite a shock to the system. Phasing through an Astral portal, by comparison, is a very smooth and controlled transition. As such, it is much easier on the system.
<br>
<br>
Plus, there is no feeling of leaving your physical body, no looking down seeing yourself on the bed and so forth. Which is okay for some. But most people who find themselves in that state get scared sh*tless.
<br>
<br>
In fact, it feels so smooth there is a strong tendency to think it's all just a vivid dream. It's not, of course, because there are distinct differences which I can readily detect as a result of my previous projection experience. Which leads me to your second point, yes, it's the same place I used to go.
<br>
<br>
Memory recollection is as easy as memory recollection is on the physical. But with one exception: if I fall asleep after the experience.
<br>
<br>
I've trained myself to go back to C1 (normal Physical consciousness) after any projection experience. But sometimes I get lazy thinking, "Oh, I'll have a few minutes of sleep then make some notes." Which is fatal, retention-wise.

 extremely

valuable here, and I thank you sincerely for sharing it with us.

You have a controlled, reliable, vivid, reproduceable and above all memorable Astral method, and which is clearly, to me anyway, a generation ahead of the conventional "forced" OBE - and it all makes alot of sense as well.
<br>
<br>
I like "Astral portal" as well - because that descibes it more or less exactly. And such portals can be created for different aspects of the Astral  - i.e., each Astral portal leads to a different Astral environment and beings.
<br>
<br>
I do have a project in mind, but I want to assimilate all of this valuable data first. But again, I am utterly convinced about this, and we definitely need to keep this in the forefront.  I am locking the topic in place for starters, so it doesn't go anywhere

hello there folks, with a tube strike forcing me to "work from home"  tomorrow, I've got plenty of opportunity to continue practising with wave 1 cd !
<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd throw in my progress so far. I've listened to the CD once every couple of days, and I'm attempting to do this early morning.... tricky at first, but the habit is slowly developing.
<br>
<br>
After ....maybe 20 - 30 listens, using a scenario a little different from Frank's ,
<br>
I am finding that it is becoming easier to keep my mind engaged in the whole imaginary scene I've constructed. At first I had to battle to keep my mind from wandering, but this is becoming less of a struggle.
<br>
<br>
Still falling asleep occasionally, ......no real progress to report to be honest !
<br>
<br>
Regarding Adrian's astral portal - I'm picturing it as a staging post between different astral planes / areas / Focuses ? Would it then be feasible to create a portal from the astral to the real time zone using this same technique of moving between different focus levels ?
<br>
cheers

Hi!!!!!  I'm doing it too!!!!!  I'm setting up my own, tailor-made scenario.  It's much more fanciful and romantic and magical, of course, but hey - - - if Frank can have a butler, why can't I have a Fairy?   A talking horse?   Instead of an elevator, or a hut . . .  how about a magic carpet?  Or a castle?  Or a Mercedez-Benz zooming on the C1-C10 highway?  The options are ENDLESS.   . . . . oooohh, now I'm thinking, Italian Countryside!  How can I work in a vinyard?

I'm even rearranging my own (real-time) bedroom so that it matches my visualizations better, because I'm working a bedroom into the sequence.  This bedroom will be my safe-space if I find myself in a pickle while on the astral.

Sounds like a very nice Astral portal

<br>
<br>
But that is one of the points about this. You are creating, and establishing, your own personal portal as a "launching pad" into the Astral proper, and to that end it needs to be a sequence that you can remember and find interesting and captivating enough not to be tedious.
<br>
<br>
In that way, you wil, I am sure, l look forward to  going through the sequence knowing you will be stepping out into the Astral at the other end.
<br>
<br>
If you do this, please let us all know how it goes

I haven't read Robert Monroe's books, so I'm not familiar with the 'focus' areas. The way Frank describes the steps, it seems very scientific and timed.

<br>
<br>
It's good to hear people getting creative. Yes, the possibilities are truly endless. Though please do always bear in mind the objective is to project within the Astral, and the imagery is merely a prop that sets the stage for the next Act. (Imagine a real stage where just a few abstract forms, here and there, can so very easily set the tone of the next Act. That's how you need to be working.)
<br>
<br>
Act 1: Energy Conversion box. Bring on the props, set the stage, do your bit, then move to Act 2: Resonant Tuning. Here the props change, you play out the scene, then move to Act 3: Declaration Stage... and so on. All so it flows with the CD. But watch you don't get bogged down in nitty-gritty detail.
<br>
<br>
Though too much detail will not effect you in the early stages. For example, you can imagine your Energy Conversion Box in as much detail as you like. It won't have any negative effects at all. Reason being, at this stage, you are still within the lower realms of your imagination. But the higher you go, creative-imagination wise, the more abstract your thoughts become. And remember that right at the end of your creative imagination, is the border to the Astral. (I promise you, it really is that close!)
<br>
<br>
That's the main reason why, imagining in too much detail can bog you down.
<i>
 In that it keeps your focal point of thinking within the lower realms of the imagination
</i>
. When what you should be doing is gradually travelling towards the border. So feeling your thoughts naturally getting progressively more abstract, the further you progress, would be a positive sign.
<br>
<br>
The key transition is from Focus 10 to Focus 12 (the tricky one!). Hence the need for all the thorough preparation beforhand. Please bear in mind that *everything* you do in the previous Acts, is done solely to bring you to the point where the transition from F10 to F12 is performed as smoothly and easily as the transition from C1 to F3 (say).
<br>
<br>
In other words, if you are having difficulty with the F10 to F12 transition, it is 99.9% likely that the cause will be due to some problem in the preparatory stages.
<br>
<br>
Focus 12 is very simple to recognise: it occurs when I say in my latest post to Adrian (above) where I sense the blackness taking on a 3D effect, and I start to see colours, etc. This is Monroe's Focus 12.
<br>
<br>
Focus 10 (mind awake body asleep) brings you to the edge of the border. And, like all Astral borders, there is not an immediate and sudden transition between one realm and the next. There is what is commonly known as a Buffer Zone.
<br>
<br>
At Focus 10, as I say, you are standing on the edge of your creative imagination. At Focus 12, you mentally "step into" the buffer zone between the edge of your creative imagination and the Astral proper. (Note: In my earlier work I used to call the effects of stepping into the buffer-zone, the "stray energy" stage.)
<br>
<br>
The F10 to F12 transistion is not given on the Wave 1 CD. So you will have to create your own sense of expectation based on my description. The F12 transition is given on a later CD but I found it of little use.
<br>
<br>
Thing is, once you are at F12, stepping into the Astral and making contact with some guide is a relatively simple matter that I imagine most people would hardly have difficulty with. Well, provided you know the ground rules about remaining mentally still (just releasing a mild air of curiosity) and remaining completely closed emotionally, that is. Otherwise you'll step into the Astral and begin flitting all over the place. Which is no use at all.
<br>
 <br>
  Yours,
  <br>
  Frank
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  PS
  <br>
  <br>
  LD: The process I describe is based on what I can glean from Monroe's latest two books (I haven't bothered with his ealiest work JOB, as Monroe says himself that he moved on from all that) which is coupled to the Gateway, Wave 1 CD. So if you have no experience with these, you will have a hard time trying to work out where I am coming from. The reason why my approach sounds scientific is because I'm a scientist.

hello there folks. I'm keenly awaiting delivery of Monroe's books on the subject...

<br>
I just realised something whilst reading the last post; I'm 99% sure it is going to happen to me, and it'll probably happen to others as well.
<br>
<br>
When I eventually step into the astral from Focus 12, I know that I'm going to be filled with excitement / emotions as I will have reached a milestone that I've been working hard for......As I understand it, this excitement / emotion is going to hinder me. What can I do to minimise this, and make my first experience a good one (!) ?

<br>
Could you possibe describe this "stray energy" and "3D blackness" a in a bit more detail? This is to assist people in recognising that they are at F12.
<br>
<br>
Also, how does the transition from the "buffer zone" to the Astral occur? E.g. is it a gradual or rapid transition, and how do your surroundings alter at thisparticular point, and also I suppose, how can you recognise that you are out of your imagination, and in the Astral proper?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again, as I said, I am asking these for a reason, in addition to hopefully assisting others.

<section>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Adrian: The 3D blackness thing is difficult to explain. (I think Jeff_M might have some better input on this as it forms the basis of his own projection technique.) I'll try and think of a good analogy and get back to the thread. With me, the point at which I sense the 3D blackness is the point where I leave the Physical behind completely. My focal point of awareness has "crossed the bridge" and is now *completely* immersed in another reality.
<br>
<br>
As for the whirls of colour. Imagine that the blackness was gently swirling around you, like a black fog. Then, intermixed with this black fog, was fog of different colours all gently swirling around. Often I can hear a tune playing which sounds like it is drifting over from a distance. Or sometimes it might be just a single note. Many times I can see a bright light (higher being) in the distance that is obscured by the fog.
<br>
<br>
In my early work, at this stage, it was common for me to hear all kinds of pops and bangs. Or sometimes I'd hear stomping noises, or Velcro-like ripping or tearing sounds, etc. I'd also see all kinds of abstract shapes like black &amp; white outline drawings. Some of them looked quite devilish in nature, and once I'd have sworn there was this huge head of a wolf right up alongside my face. Which there wasn't, of course, but the energy was perceived that way for some reason.
<br>
<br>
However, I find that, nowadays, all I get is the coloured swirling fog which is often accompanied by musical tones of various description, and the bright light.
<br>
<br>
I'm normally in the buffer zone for about 5 seconds. All the while the fog is swirling I get a sensation of gradual movement. Then the fog clears and the Astral comes into view. What I see, or what I do from here depends on my original Intent. If I pass through with no real fixed objective (as I often do, but I'm trying to get out of the habit), I'll just end up standing around somewhere, in no place in particular. What I like to then do is walk around for a short while, just taking in the fact that "here I am again". From which point I'll decide what to do.
<br>
 <br>
 At this stage, it is obvious that I am situated within the Astral proper. There is no mistaking it. It feels *exactly* like I was standing within the Physical, only it's the Astral. Though please bear in mind this is only due to the fact that I can remain emotionally closed.
 <br>
 <br>
 The tendency for newcomers, at this point, is to flit all over the place as their minds flit here and there. Which brings me to Clandestino's point about excitement and so forth. Yes, this is a very natural thing and any emotional release will hinder your progress. But at least you know that.
 <br>
 <br>
 The first 10 or 20 times you project your emotional release will no doubt scupper your experiences. But your realisation of the fact that it is your own emotional release that is the cause, will help you overcome the problem within a relatively short time.
 <br>
 <br>
 When I first started projecting within the Astral, I had one heck of a job trying to make sense of it all. One moment I'd be immersed in one scene, then another, then another......
 <br>
 <br>
 At that time there were no Internet BBS's that you could join in order to ask questions and get help (er, come to think of it, when I first started there were no desktop computers!). As a result, it took me just over 5 years before the penny dropped, and I realised that my own release of emotion was the cause of my flitting about here, there and everywhere.
 <br>
 <br>
 Nowadays, the facts about emotions and their effects when released within the Astral are starting to become common knowledge. Which means the problems can be overcome in weeks, not years.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your detailed and valuable information.
<br>
<br>
I am leaving this topic locked for now so we can build on it. And get a better "picture" of the whole thing.
<br>
<br>
I was wondering whether you had tried, or thought about doing the whole sequence without the Gateway CD yet? Many here won't be in a position to get it.
<br>
<br>
Also - once in the Astral, I assume that you become unaware of the CD track itself.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again  - this is developing into something most useful I believe.
<br>
<br>
With kind regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

My focal point of awareness has "crossed the bridge" and is now *completely* immersed in another reality.

You know what I like about your posts, Frank?  They help me to pinpoint exactly where I am in my progress, in regards to Monroe's Focus Levels.  For example, I never realized that I was in Focus 12 when I started to see the blackness turn three-dimensional!
<br>
<br>
Adrian....I'll try my best to explain a little more about how I percieve these 3D shapes and blackness.
<br>
<br>
To get a better idea, just close your eyes right now for about five seconds.  If you're like me, you see blackness....probably some spots of light and after images, but mostly just black.  Another thing you would have noticed is that this blackness is two dimensional.  It's like looking at a TV screen.  You may see things, but there is no depth to them.
<br>
<br>
Once you get around Focus 10 (mind awake/body asleep), you will have begun to see more images (still two dimensional).  With me, these images don't disappear quite as quickly as before, although they still only last a couple of seconds.  I just try to leave my mind open to receive anything that I'm shown.  Usually I see all kinds of weird, fleeting images.  If I could write down my mental process at the time, it's kind of like this:
<br>
<br>
::blackness::
<br>
<br>
:::image::::
<br>
<br>
"Hmmm, looks like a stick."
<br>
<br>
::blackness::
<br>
<br>
::new image::
<br>
<br>
"There's something green....."
<br>
<br>
::blackness::
<br>
<br>
The hardest part is quieting this internal dialogue that takes place in your mind, since your mind thinks it's "Mr. Know It All" and tries to prove how smart it is by identifying everything it sees!  Like Frank says, maintaining a curious, open mentality is extremely important from this point on.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, you'll start to notice that this two dimensional blackness starts to take on some depth.  It almost looks like there is a black wall a little further back from the blackness that you've been looking at.  It's at this point where the images I see start to become three dimensional.  Instead of seeing just a stick or a color, I start to see things with more shapes, like a ball, or a book.  I consciously acknowledge this turning point, and I realize that I can now observe depth perception.  Although I know that my body is still somewhere, I am starting to get drawn into this void.  So when I see these images begin to take on this tangible look to them, I know I'm getting close to phasing into the astral realm.
<br>
<br>
I hope I did some justice with that explanation.  I'm sure Frank will add/comment on it when he gets some time.

<section>
Ok,  I am really excited!!!!  First of all, I don't have the CDs either so I only know of the different focuses that are described on this thread.  For the past month I have been fooling around with consciousness levels and totally ignoring the manual Projecting sequence that it recommended in the book.  Just having too much fun with WILDs remote eye and other such stuff.  After reading Jeff M and Franks last post it was as if they crawled inside my head during one of my meditations.  The same sequence that Jeff described is for word exactly how I experience it.  You see, just this past week the blackness turned 3-D and thinking it was a figment of my imagination I thought how strange.  Were is this supposed to be going.
<br>
<br>
Instead of just looking at a black slate behind the eyes it has turned and felt like a void or section in space expecting to see stars and planets but none to be seen.  I have a sense that it is the same void that some people experience when they projected but their astral sight hasn't turned on yet.  Is this the same void?
<br>
<br>
And also I have a question on the 3-D images, when I wake up from a vivid dream or lucid I see the 3-D images (not all the time) slowly appear in my view turn on 25-30 degree axis so you can see every angle of the item and slowly fade to be slowly replaced by another rotating 3-D item. They are almost more 3-D with the shading depth than a normal physical world object.  Is this type of 3-D figure the same that is to be experienced in the 3-D void?  And Frank, how long did it take for the 3-D to become swirling color?
<br>
<br>
If you can't afford the Monroe CD's, don't  feel like you are left out and in the dark.  Relax and work with your consciousness.  Slowly let go and experience the feelings and experiences that your mind gives you.  See how close you can get before going to sleep and keep your journal of your experiences.  Be patient and be happy to have progressed as far as you have.  The CDs sound just wonderful and very helpful but are spendy at this time.
<br>
<br>
Thank you  all very much for being so open!  Know I don't feel so lost.

Tracy: you hit on something important which I'd like to stress again: It's where you say, "Be patient and be happy to have progressed as far as you have".
<u>
 This is ever so important
</u>
.
<br>
<br>
Now and again, someone will turn up with the question about wanting to AP. But they say they are impatient and want quick results. Problem being, Astral projection is not something you can throw money at and it comes quicker, like, paying extra for next-day delivery.
<br>
<br>
The other aspect concerns your use of the word: happy. So many people approach AP like they were approaching some wild animal. From many people's posts it seems like every twist and turn is yet another cause for alarm. Leading to yet more anxiety, fear and stress.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to take this opportunity to hit home the fact that Astral Projection is FUN. Yes, it's incredible FUN. And it fills you with a tremendous sense of JOY and HAPPINESS.
<br>

<br>
<br>
It's not so much the 3D changes into swirling colour. It's more like a passing through phase. All the while I'm getting a sensation of movement where first it becomes 3D, then I move through that and get to the swirling colour stage. Then the fog clears, so to speak, and the Astral comes into view.
<br>
<br>
Looking at it another way, if I get to the 3D stage and just remain there, then there I will remain just floating in a 3D void. Oh, while on the subject of being in the void, what you might try is asking for some music. It's really nice floating in the void listening to your favourite classical pieces.

Yep, that seems to be where I'm at now.  Having difficulty going 'further' to the next phase.
<br>
<br>
Frank, let me ask you.  You've mentioned on a number of occasions that you simply phase into the astral....no feelings of separation from a physical body.  So would you say that you simply feel a slight movement (while passing through F12 &amp; swirly color phase) and then BOOM!  You find yourself in the astral environment?
<br>
<br>
Also, while getting there in this manner, do you suddenly become aware that you have an astral body?  Where you can feel yourself walking, looking at hands, etc?
<br>
<br>
I only ask because virtually all of my OBE's have happened from feeling a separation from my body....so I have had body-like sensations from the beginning.  If I simply phase out into the astral, do these body sensations kick in once I'm actively moving around?
<br>
<br>
And one more thing....when I am going through my relaxation techniques and I hit F12, I'm not imaging myself moving.  There is no visualization scene in my head like the one which you envision while listening to the tape.  Do you think once I get to F12, I should start to IMAGINE some movement forward, through the images?
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your reply, my British friend!

On reflection, I think "movement" is perhaps not the right word. It's more of a gradual mental shift that starts from first seeing what look like moving shadows for about 5 seconds, then 3D blackness quickly followed by the swirling for, say, another 5 seconds, then the Astral gradually comes into view. At this point, I am viewing the Astral from a short distance like if I were at the cinema viewing the Astral on the screen.
<br>
<br>
Here I have 2 choices: 1) I can put out an "intent" to view something and watch it on the Astral screen. For example, I enjoy working with horses and I like to watch horses in action during olden times. Chariot racing is my favourite thing to watch at the moment, followed by jousting. But you can basically ask to see whatever you want and up it comes on the screen. (Though this is one of those things that it far easier to say, than to do! But it gets easier the more you practise).
<br>
<br>
Second choice: I allow myself to mentally step into the Astral scene, whereupon I find myself within the Astral proper. Here I am free to just walk around, chat with the locals, etc.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Having an "Astral body" is not something that I become aware of. In the sense that I don't really need to think about it. I am free to walk about, as I say, and chat with the locals. But it just feels like it's me, normally, like I were in the Physical. Obviously, the "body" I am in, within the Astral, is not literally my physical body. But it feels exactly the same as if it were.
<br>
<br>
It's difficult for me to explain, but there is no point in the process where I feel any kind of separation from my physical body. It literally feels like all that happened is the scenary changed.
<br>
<br>

What I would do is try and phase-into the Astral from the 3D blackness stage and not worry about any kind of body.

<br>
<br>
<br>
The visualisation scenes that I use are merely tools that are designed to get me to F12 (and the subsequent transition to the Astral). So as soon as I begin to perceive F12 "symptoms" the previous visualisation stuff is redundant.
<br>
<br>
When at F12, INTENT and EXPECTATION start to play a big role.
<br>
<br>
Basically, Intent is the engine that drives you, and Expectation has a kind of feedback effect that pushes aside possible reality-fluctuation effects caused by Doubt and the like. Problem is, at this stage and beyond, you become your own self-fulfilling prophecy so you have to watch what you are thinking very carefully.
<br>
<br>
Try floating in the 3D blackness and put out a specific intent to do something in particular and see what happens.

Frank, your words are so powerful. You should write a book about this! When you say that you voice your intent to view something...are you viewing actual events that have occured? Is it like going to the akashic records? When I read your posts, I can't help imagining the things you've gone through. It must be amazing!  ...Have your thoughts or emotions ever caused something to happen in the physical?

<br>
<br>
LD: Yes, I am sure that what I am viewing are events that have occured. But I have no actual proof of that (yet). I hesitate to use the term "Akashic Records" as mystical terminology is not my thing. But these particular kinds of images I am viewing on the Astral screen came about originally after posting an Intent to view the Akashic records (or at least my understanding of them).
<br>
<br>
My overall intention is to try and view specific points in time. At the moment, all I can do, it seems, is to view an overview of events (if that makes sense) that appear to be occuring over, say, several months (or maybe even years) of time.
<br>
<br>
It's like, for example, if you were to take a photograph but not wind the film to the next frame. Then take another picture, but again not wind the film on. So take, say, five pictures like this without winding the film on each time. The resulting image would be a bit of a jumble. But look closely and you would be able to pick out lots of bits of detail about each of the pictures you took. But there would not be just one clear image that captured one specific point in time. Which is what I am currently working on doing.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the kind comments and the book suggestion. Yes, having a high degree of control over the projection process allows you to dig deeper; as you are no-longer at the mercy of all kinds of reality fluctuations. I'm not sure how my interactions with the Astral are affecting my Physical. To be honest, I try my hardest to keep the two entirely separate.

Ok Frank, I have to ask this.  When you see this screen does it show actually moving scenes or are they more a sort of virtual reality where if an object in that scene is a little to far away to recognize that you ask to see the image at an angle.  And complying with your request it rotates around so you can see the sides and back of the image until you recognize it.
<br>
<br>
And are all the images on the screen real physical looking or can there be images that look more of a virtual reality look to them?  More fakey plastic or clay look along with real physical looking items?  For example a screen of a cute pleasant looking kitchen and wooden table along with a pair of fakey plastic pants hovering in mid air close to the kitchen table.  Sorry about the example but I thought it would help in the description.  This all relates back to the 3-D images I talked about earlier which by the way also have actual scenes of places.  I'm trying to figure out if these scenes are astral in origin or just my brain taking me for a ride.

<br>
Where there actually people in the pictures you viewed or did you have to go in the astral land and find them?
<br>
<br>
On another note, Even though you have had the cds to guide you I have no idea how you found all this out on your own.  When I go out and just play with my unconscious and strange things occur I feel like I am fumbling around in the dark not sure where I am going or what these strange assurances are supposed to mean and what are you supposed to do next.  Somehow I am guided to the next level and a new mystery unfolds itself feeling lost again.  When I hear someone else actually has been through the same sequence I feel grounded again like I am not going in no man's land.  I know that you have went through this all by yourself and went through the hard work and creativity of solving what to do next without earthly guidance.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the helpful info and for being a pioneer in a strange land.

By the way I'm editing this to say  how right you are about having fun and being happy.   I figure we have the rest of our lives to develop our abilities so relax have fun with it.  See how your unconcious guides you from one area and then to another area all by itself without being forced.  It's like a great novel (or good wine) that should  be savored and experienced.

Ok....I've been here before.  In fact, just the other night, I saw this mini-cinema.  It was a small, square scene in the middle of the blackness, which showed me a sidewalk.  Of course, right after I realized how real this was for being on my bed, my attention went back to my body in bed. Dooohhh!  This kept happening over and over until I went to sleep.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, assuming that I didn't lose this astral image....when a person is at this point in his trance-state, would you say you could technically phase into the astral within the next few seconds?  I would think so, since you're already starfting to see these 'scenes.'  However, I think deep down, I've instilled the false belief in my mind that once I see these scenes, I still have a little ways to go before I can project.

<section>
Greetings!
<br>
<br>
Just a couple fo comments.
<br>
<br>
First  - the "Akashic Records" might be more aptly called the "Etheric Records". It is conceptualised as a library, but this seem  largely to behave as a symbolic request to view the information. I don't think everyone is permitted to view the Etheric Records, rather only those with the appropriate level of development. I must say that I try to avoid the Far Eastern terminology and use e.g. "Cause and Effect" rather than "Karma". I don't have problem with Eastern terminology per se, but I don't think they assist the Western way of understanding things always.
<br>
<br>
As for Jeff's cinema screen. I would suggest that anything you are shown at this stage is symbolic. E.g the sidewalk might be an invitation to walk down it. Have you considered trying to "walk" or "project" through that image? You could try, by means of your imagination, imagining yourself to be smaller than the image, and simply walk into it as the portal it surely is. This is similar to another Astral technique whereby one imagines a door with a certain symbol on it. It might be a symbol of the elements (Tattwas in Eastern speak), or a Runic Symbol, or another syembol, and with the imagination, the doors is opened so that you can walk straight into that world.

I want to thank everyone very much for your contributions so far in this subject, and particularly Frank whos assistance and advice is very valuable. I am still looking at implementing a project that should prove most interesting, and bring more people in touch with the Astral.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,

Adrian.

  Ok Frank, I have to ask this.  When you see this screen does it show actually moving scenes or are they more a sort of virtual reality where if an object in that scene is a little to far away to recognize that you ask to see the image at an angle.  And complying with your request it rotates around so you can see the sides and back of the image until you recognize it.

Yes, moving scenes that look as real as if I were watching a movie at the cinema.

  For example a screen of a cute pleasant looking kitchen and wooden table along with a pair of fakey plastic pants hovering in mid air close to the kitchen table.  Sorry about the example but I thought it would help in the description.  This all relates back to the 3-D images I talked about earlier which by the way also have actual scenes of places.  I'm trying to figure out if these scenes are astral in origin or just my brain taking me for a ride.

The problem you face at this stage of development, i.e. when a person gets to the stage where they begin to see inner visions (or progress to Focus 22 and beyond, in Monroe speak), is you become your own self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, as you think so it instantly becomes, all around you in glorious 3D Technicolour.
<br>
<br>
So if you decide that these images are your brain "taking you for a ride" that is how they will become for you.
<i>
 Which is why it is very important to learn how to become completely and totally still, mentally
</i>
. Otherwise you will become forever entangled in all kinds of reality fluctuations.
<br>
<br>
Taking your "kitchen" as an example: You may be viewing someone's Astral kitchen, but there is an inkling of a doubt inside you that what you are seeing is true Astral reality. What happens is, the Doubt that you feel will manifest in some symbolic way (this touches on Adrian's recent post in reply to Jeff's point about the sidewalk). You might see the cooker, for example, upside down sitting in the sink.
<br>
<br>
Upon returning to Physical, you dismiss the affair. Thinking there was no way you were projecting to the Astral: it was just your brain playing tricks. So you think your Doubt was justified. As Doubt has now been reinforced that little bit more, next time you project it manifests again, and again, just that little bit more each time. Let this continue and you will reach the stage where you will dismiss the whole idea of Astral projection as just some whacky nonsense. (We had someone join the BBS not so long ago who had gone down this exact route.)
<br>
<br>
The key thing to realise, is the Astral is a completely separate field of realty. As such, very different ground rules apply. Once you know those rules and can abide by them, the Astral becomes a very stable place. It is even more stable than the Physical. In the sense there are no earthquakes, tornados, terrorist bombs, car crashes. In fact, there is no death or destruction at all (well, the near-earth planes are a bit iffy but these are easily avoided).

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
When viewing the Astral screen I am simply a passive observer. From this stage I can choose to mentally step into the scene whereupon it becomes a part of me and I, in turn, become a part of it.
<br>
<br>
The way you navigate on the Astral is by use of INTENT which is something I am still working on. For many years I was in the habit of just projecting to any old place and seeing what was around. So now I'm getting out of that habit and trying to project with a specific Intent each time. But still, I can so very easily get sidetracked.
<br>
<br>
Interacting with the locals can be tremendous fun. And, if the conditions are right, the temptation to play tricks is too great to resist (well, for me that is). My two favourites are jumping off tall buildings and walking on water, both of which can attract quite a large crowd.

  On another note, Even though you have had the cds to guide you I have no idea how you found all this out on your own.  When I go out and just play with my unconscious and strange things occur I feel like I am fumbling around in the dark not sure where I am going or what these strange assurances are supposed to mean and what are you supposed to do next.  Somehow I am guided to the next level and a new mystery unfolds itself feeling lost again.  When I hear someone else actually has been through the same sequence I feel grounded again like I am not going in no man's land.  I know that you have went through this all by yourself and went through the hard work and creativity of solving what to do next without earthly guidance.

Yep, what you describe I recognise only too well. It has taken me 20 years of trial and error to get to where I am today. If I could go back and change anything it would be my initial thinking that all the stuff about Astral guides, and such, was just a load of mystical nonsense.

 This set me back quite a number of years

. Which is why I always recommend the first thing people do is to become open to the idea of having Astral guides right from the start.

  Ok....I've been here before.  In fact, just the other night, I saw this mini-cinema.  It was a small, square scene in the middle of the blackness, which showed me a sidewalk.  Of course, right after I realized how real this was for being on my bed, my attention went back to my body in bed.

  Anyway, assuming that I didn't lose this astral image....when a person is at this point in his trance-state, would you say you could technically phase into the astral within the next few seconds?  I would think so, since you're already starfting to see these 'scenes.'  However, I think deep down, I've instilled the false belief in my mind that once I see these scenes, I still have a little ways to go before I can project.

Try and think about it as being a natural, smooth transition from one focus level, to the next. I get the impression (do please correct me if I am wrong) that you are thinking of it like you go through various preliminary stages, then, blammo, you suddenly find yourself projecting within the Astral.
<br>
<br>
You have received an inkling of the next stage, which is the Astral screen that starts to come about at the Focus 21 state. You are obviously not yet comfortable in this state as your protective sense of awareness keeps zapping you back to C1 (Physical). But once you are comfortable viewing the screen, you can phase naturally into Focus 22 which is where you mentally step into the screen.
<br>
<br>
Focus 22, is a region of consciousness that, in my early posts, I termed the Training Ground. In my early days of projection, I got stuck projecting to this region for around 5 years before the penny dropped, and I realised that the scenary that surrounded me was fuelled by my own release of emotion.
<br>
<br>
Focus 22 is also known as the Lucid Dream state. The big difference being you will be entering this region of consciousness with full conscious awareness and, therefore, full control of your actions; as opposed to the limited level of conscious awareness experienced when Lucid Dreaming. Here, don't be surprised if you see people just milling around aimlessly like they were drugged, or something. They are just people who are asleep.

Hey Frank.....I've often wondered about this.  Why do you suppose things like walking on water attracts crowds in the astral?  Technically, can't everyone on that realm do exactly the same thing?  Or do you think you're phasing into a Focus Level of people who are not tuned into their environment and what they're capable of?

Well, I never CONSCIOUSLY acknowledged that I think this way, but when I stop to analyze my thoughts (which is inevitable when you try to astral project), I began to realize that while I'm on the borderline of consciously phasing into the astral, I still felt that one of two things had to happen:
<br>
<br>
1) I had to briefly lose consciousness in order to completely forget about the physical
<br>
<br>
2) If I didn't lose consciousness, I still had much further to go before I could step into the astral scene on Focus 22.
<br>
<br>
I know that when I began to see these astral scenes, I would be so passive that my INTENT wasn't present!  I wonder of others make that mistake.  Deep down you WANT to project (which is why you're still conscious at this point, but you've been so mentally passive to get here that your intent gets brushed aside.  Then you get frustrated that you're so close but nothing happens, so you roll over and go to sleep.

I agree, although not being 'comfortable' with this stage kinda makes it sound like I'm 'uncomfortable.'  I think 'unfamiliar' is a better word.

But I thank you for breaking down these benchmarks into Focus Levels.  It makes me smile to think that I'm that far along, since up until now, I was thinking these 3D shapes and astral scenes were all part of the Focus 12 area!

Most of my projections have been after losing consciousness, and then finding myself in the RTZ (or close to it).  What focus level would that be?  Would that be considered the Training Ground which is simulated to look like my physical environment?

I have encountered this on a couple of occasions.  I projected and found myself in the yard of my deceased grandmother's house.  In the front yard, some girl was aimlessly walking.  I came up and hugged her from behind (I get real affectionate when I'm out!), but she was like a zombie.  I had a feeling right then and there that she was sleeping.

If conditions are right, they will look at you as "one of them" in the sense they don't realise that technically your're not: which gives you a mega advantage.

I'm still a practical joker at heart (legacy from my youth) and opportunities for mischief abound to the point where it's difficult to resist.
<br>
<br>
The real-time zone is some kind of buffer between Astral and Physical. It's not a mental focus state as such, and I have very little experience of RTZ projection. I only learnt to do it for the very first time about 8 months, or so, ago after having had hundreds of Astral experiences over quite a number of years. I found the novelty wore off very quickly, as there is nothing of any real interest you can do (by comparison to the Astral, I mean).
<br>
<br>
The Training Ground is Focus 22. Which is the first mental state you reach after crossing the Astral bridge at Focus 21. Once that bridge is crossed, all release of thought-release-emotion becomes immediate action. Unless you realise this and adapt your behaviour accordingly, your progress to the higher realms will be severely curtailed. Hence my calling it the Training Ground, because it like prepares you for progression to the higher planes.
<br>
<br>
As for your need to "lose consciousness" please realise that, correctly applied, with phasing there is
<u>
 no loss of consciousness
</u>
! This is the very essence of the success of the technique! And is the primary reason why, for example, you can achieve near 100% recall.
<br>
<br>
The 3D shapes are characteristic of Focus 12. As you progress you should find you come across a kind of null-zone where everything seems to just hang. I mean "hang" in the sense of a computer screen that sometimes can just suddenly hang on it's last action and do nothing more from then on. You may also suddenly get strong intuitive feelings about, say, answers to questions you might have had lingering in your mind: this is Focus 15.
<br>
<br>
Then things begin to crystallize and you begin to see the Astral screen at Focus 21. This is where INTENT starts to play a big role (Intent is the engine that drives you on to the other, higher states).

This definitely would explain a lot .  Since the brain is "in tuned" to the consciousness and the astral, it is only natural that doubt would manifest in some form of image instead of an emotion.  We are using our visual in so much at this point.  I was expecting doubt and the like would manifest in an emotion like it does in the physical.  Thanks for helping me with this!

It is worth mentioning that this is one important reason the Astral exists. For those not aware of the higher spheres and Spiritual realities, it would be too much of a shock for them to pass from the physical world, into a world way beyond their comprehension - which is what the spheres beyond the Astral would be. So the Astral is the first stop for most, and a close reflection of the physical, i.e. the
<b>
 As above, so below
</b>
. .
<br>
<br>
It works both ways as well - the Astral also reflects in the physical - that is why they are so closely interrelated.
<br>
<br>
It is also why we see "belief system" areas, and indeed many other types of areas.  The very highest Astral levels are where people have eventually got the idea of eternal, infinite Spiritual realities, an have fulfllled their desires in the Astral. They have higher vibrations, and lower density, and their Astral bodies will soon dissolve in the elements as they go through the "second death" as they pass on to the mental spheres.

Hello everyone!
<br>
This all makes for very interesting reading,
<br>
I have absolutly no experience of using Monroe's techniques, this thread is my first experience of them, I have always concentrated on projecting into the RT zone rather than phazing into the astral proper.
<br>
<br>
I think that I should switch to this second method for two reasons:
<br>
<br>
1) a much better, more rewarding experience will result from being on the astral as the physical is not really that interesting when oob, we can explore all the wonders of the physical during the day while in our bodies!
<br>
<br>
2) I have had several experiences of waking up from a dream state and finding myself viewing the 'astral cinema screen' effect, this happens fairly frequently.
<br>
When I was reading your descriptions I recognised this right away!
<br>
Sometimes I'll wake up (lucid) and see a square 'screen' in front of me containing some scene that is absolutly vivid and real. I don't ever do anything about it though, I just watch it until it disolves and I physically 'wake up'.
<br>
<br>
 From reading your posts I should maybe think about stepping into those scenes as they appear to be astral portals!
 <br>
 Does this mean that in these situations I am lucky enough to become aware at monroe's focus 12 level or something?
 <br>
 <br>
 Anyway,
 <br>
 Thanks for the interesting post, I think I'll look out monroe's material and check it out!
 <br>
 <br>
 Regards,
 <br>
 Douglas

The Astral screen effect comes about at Focus 21. When you step into it, this is the Phasing to Focus 22. As I said in an earlier post, Focus 22 is also known as the Lucid Dream state. But you are entering this state with full waking consciousness; as opposed to "waking up" within a Lucid Dream where you generally only have part conscious awareness, which makes a BIG difference.
<br>
<br>
If you Phase further and find yourself amongst all kinds of black and grey nasty stuff teaming with every manner of Human crud, then you are in Focus 23. And if you think Focus 23 is weird then Phase further and prepare to be weirded out to the n'th degree.

Hi everyone
<br>
<br>
My experiences of Focus 10 and 12 are as follows.  Focus 10 fells as if I am in an enclosed room, and it is at this point that sensations such as various types of vibrations usually begin.  Focus 12 feels quite different from this; it feels more as if I am standing on the top of a large building from which a starry sky can be perceived above and the darkness in front of me takes on a much more energetic quality, as if there was a sort of electric plasma there.  Am I on the right track here?
<br>
<br>
I've currently reached the Freedom First Stage Separation exercise. This is the exercise where you try out various ways of getting out of the physical body like backing away and floating up like a cloud.  During this, I get a sort of dim perception of seeing my body from far away, though it's more of a perception than an actual out of body experience.  Still, I think success might be getting close.

I have to admit to having no idea. The Hemisync side of things I never really understood. There are some feint sounds on the CD that I assume are the Hemisync tones but they can hardly be heard.

Yes, there is a kind of feint hiss which I'm sure will just be white or pink noise.

Sorry still don't know how to used those Darn Quotes...;)
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Quote from Frank:
 <br>
 The 3D shapes are characteristic of Focus 12. As you progress you should find you come across a kind of null-zone where everything seems to just hang. I mean "hang" in the sense of a computer screen that sometimes can just suddenly hang on it's last action and do nothing more from then on. You may also suddenly get strong intuitive feelings about, say, answers to questions you might have had lingering in your mind: this is Focus 15.
</p>
<p>
 Greetings;
</p>
<p>
 Yes, IMPO, F12 is one of the most interesting levels reached next, as one awareness begins to move further into the Mfield. After one has been to F12 enough times, the external sound patterns are no longer necessary cd/tape/etc.
</p>
<p>
 Also in Focus 12 individual can have an access point to intuitional information about all their incarnations.. meaning Your Higher Self which you mind perceived through non-verbal precognitive filtering systems. Access to usual human senses is diminished by about 80% or around there. And yes a common experience at this level of focus, where one experiences feeling colours, seeing sounds, etc.. As sensory processing begins to change and your getting used to this stage.
</p>
<p>
 It appears that between major areas depths of focus, there are zones where there is not much activity at all, so called Null Zones. They say F13-14 are Null Zones, but if your Intent is to find something YOU will..
</p>
<p>
 Focus 15 my favourite
 <img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20021114103629im_/http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile.gif"/>
 is marked by an extremely small amount of sensory input from the physical and even more in the M-field. I found intuitional experience becomes very strong in F15. It fell/like a timeless place containing quantum or large groups of informations rather than detailed bits. Information about other places, peoples, and elements of different time periods can be accessed here and will sometimes be transmitted in bundles of meaning (Monroe calls it rotes) never seen one though..
 <img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20021114103629im_/http://www.astralpulse.com/forums/images/icon_Smile_sad.gif"/>
 All I see is just a TV/Cinema screen type more of less.
</p>
<p>
 Quote from Frank;
 <br>
 Then things begin to crystallize and you begin to see the Astral screen at Focus 21. This is where INTENT starts to play a big role (Intent is the engine that drives you on to the other, higher states).
</p>
<p>
 Sorry but the Astral screen that you are taking about.. For myself its in F12-F15, but we are all different
</p>
<p>
 The key point here is that we OBE..

Frank, could you comment on the "intent" aspect once at Focus 21.
<br>
<br>
Could you describe your approach once there at Focus 21, and how you utilise  intent.
<br>
<br>
My experience with Focus 21, if I practice in the evening, brings about a lot of sleepiness, and it's very hard not to fall asleep. It seems to be the border that has to be crossed while keeping your mind awareness from sleep.

  I know Mr Gorniak, he is the one I have bought the home Gateway serie, from wave 1 to 7. The Focus levels 3, 10, 12 and 21 are part of the program.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee for the 6 days course are around 1,500$. After doing the home serie mentionned, I'm not sure if it is worth all  the money. After that you can follow with the Lifeline and another serie that takes you to Focus 35, each at about the same cost. That's an impressive amount of money.
  <br>
  <br>
  If your goal is OBE, not many have had the experience using the Hemi-Sync.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's the "Afterlife knowledge" site of Bruce Moen, who has studied at TMI, wrote four books and he gives workshops, that teaches doing the same thing without the use of the CD.
  <br>
  <br>
  It seems to me as there's a missing link somewhere. The use of the CDs (hemi-sync approach) and the way that Frank uses them, to experience OBE.
  <br>
  Doing energy work or not, the relaxation etc...Some have success with these aspect, others don't use any of this stuff.  So where's the problem ?
  <br>
  <br>
  The CDs seems to "take you" at the door, but it's once there that I think you succeed or not. Placing "intent", the vizualisation, loosing body consciousness etc...
  <br>
  <br>
  Reading on this site all those as myself trying to OBE,  the difficulty lies in my opinion, in "crossing over".  Many get at the door, with the CDs or alone, but fail there.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm very grateful the someone like Frank and others share their experiences openly. And  all the exchanges on the Gateway serie on this site provides valuable datas that hopefully will give us clues on that "missink link"
  <br>
  <br>
  My sincere thanks and appreciations to all of you OBErs, sharing with us.

<br>
I want to first answer your last point about sleep. People fall asleep from habit. As your physical body goes to sleep, it's like there is some signal that says, "Physical is going to sleep... now initiate Mind cut-off."
<br>
<br>
Somehow you have to break that habit. It isn't hard to do (unless you think of it that way) it's just a tricky mental balancing act you need to get into the habit of doing. Which can take time to get your head around. In other words, you need to go through a phase where you are working on swapping habits.
<br>
<br>
Someone like Mr Berry, for example, from what he says never seemed to get into the habit of initiating Mind cut-off to any great extent. As a result, he seems more in the habit of
<u>
 not
</u>
switching off access to Mind as his physical body goes to sleep. Therefore, projection comes easy to him.
<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, all Astral projection involves is to simply let your mind remain awake and alert, while allowing your physical body to go to sleep. Because once your physical body nods off, that's it, you're free! Obviously, someone who has been in the habit of doing the opposite for 50 years of their life, say, chances are will find it a tricky habit to get out of. But it is by no means impossible.
<br>
<br>
People also get the misguided idea that they need some kind of empty-mind condition before they can phase-in to the Astral. This is not the case at all. I suspect a lot of failures come about from this misguided notion. The key is to concentrate on the task in hand, just like you would concentrate on any other task.
<br>
<br>
Another trap that befalls beginners is, they go about their normal day right up until the point where they lay in bed *then* they start to practise their techniques. Which I feel this is a big mistake. The time for practise is during the day:
<i>
 and it is from such practise that you develop the Intent
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
First, you need to believe that what you are attempting to achieve (Astral projection) is possible. Next you develop a firm intention to achieve that goal. Having the Intent leads you to practice the necessary mental techniques; which takes concentration. Concentrating without having a firm belief, for example, won't bring results. Neither will having a firm believe but allowing your mind wander all over the place through lack of Intent.
<br>
<br>
As I say, the time for practice is during the day. With myself, in my mind, I *constantly* hold an image at a place in my head where the Astral TV screen effect comes about at Focus 21. During waking hours I cannot see the image as clear as day, like I can normally, because I am out of phase with it during Physical waking hours. But I still hold the impression of it CONSTANTLY in mind.
<br>
<br>
As such, when I come to project, I do so with the specific intention of phasing to the screen. This is my first step. Then, as the screen comes fully into view, I take the next step which is normally to travel to my regular guide, Harath. Unless I'm going through a "not talking to him" phase in which case I might take an Astral stroll, have a chat with a few locals, and so on.
<br>
<br>
I've said in previous posts that the Astral is very much closer to us that I suspect most people think. Which is why Imagination is a very powerful tool. I also suspect that a lot of people don't realise that their higher imagination-release-memory functions are not contained within the physical body at all.
<br>
<br>
So I would say to people first starting out down the Astral-phasing road, is to imagine doing it at every opportunity you can during the day to the point where a permanent connection is made. Or at least the feeling of a connection is there, all the time, during waking hours,
<br>

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thanks once again for your time in conveying such excellent information!
<br>
<br>
One point you make I believe is particularly relevant - "making the connection". I think that is extremely important for progressing to the Astral, and once that connection is made, it should be fairly easy to maintain it in future.
<br>
<br>
The problem is, from the day we are born, we are surrounded by "maya illusion". Our parents shake rattles at us, and hang mobiles over our heads, teach us about colours, textures, sounds and so on, in preparing us for "life" in the physical world. That is all well and good, and their intentions are completely honourable, but while focussing on the physical world, you are de-focussing the Astral world, and the Spirit worlds from whence you came.
<br>
<br>
Astral work therefore, aside from all of the disciplines Frank has discussed here, is all about peeling away the physical world illusion that has built up, almost like layers over the years, like a shutter at the window, and establishing that contact again with the Astral.  Frank's suggestion of maintaining that connection therefore is, as always, an excellent one.
<br>
<br>
The other major factor is deep physical relaxation - the body asleep condition. Without that, Astral most Astral work of this kind is extremely difficult.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again Frank!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

I don't know if I'm normal in this respect, but I think my mind goes to dreamland well before my body falls asleep.  That's why I get what I call "napjerks", when in my dream I'm falling or waving or something, and in my physical arm flails about in bed (sometimes waking me up, or sometimes waking up the person I've just unwittingly smacked in the head).

Jacara: guides can be a right PITA because they never give you a straight answer. My regular guide speaks almost entirely in riddles which, I suppose, is designed to stimulate curiosity. But often all I simply want is a straight answer to a straight question and, for whatever reason, he always seems to take this as some cue to go off on a tangent. And there's only so much I can take before telling him to get lost.

Hi everyone,
<br>
This is very interesting. I have several of the Hemi-Sync CDs and Holo-Sync also. I have used them to to initiate meditation and obe many times. I purposely did not choose the ones that have guided imagery on them, only the musical tones which alter brain waves. Yet there is one thing I see the guided imagery on these tapes seem to stress is "Levels", that is, they provide you with an intent, an absolute destination to focus on. I guess that my point in this observation is that to "arrive" you should have a definate "place" to go. Am I misunderstanding the direction of these guided tapes? If this is a correct assumption, then choosing a destination, without a guided meditation, would work just as well. The common denominator being "Intent" and "Preconceived Destination".

Ok, I'm realizing more and more how complex the mind is in terms of projection variety and there subtle differences.  I was getting confused of whether I am going into Focus 21 or having a remote eye experience because I have been seeing full view close up scenes such as my front door.  This is similar during a remote eye situation and the consciousness slams back into the body C1.  But reading earlier post says that the door could be symbolic.
<br>
<br>
**Strange part**  For 2 hours this morning I have been trying to find out more about this on this thread but the computer kept crashing and I would feel very tired.  I also had this feeling like I'm to go upstairs and meditate to be shown the next piece of the puzzle.  So I said "what the heck is going on,   this darn computer...." and went upstairs to meditate.  After reaching F 12, I find myself in the same situation of full-blown view.  And this time I was able to stay out longer and not slam back to C1 but just have a subtle shift back to the body.  I was not expectiong the really
<u>
 passive
</u>
feeling like  "ok, I'm here and happy where ever I am.
<br>
<br>
Can a person project directly to the astral, bypass the little cinema screen and just be there?
<br>
<br>
Also, have you been shown books, text on paper that are  placed in front of you too read.  You were able to read the text but being so passive in the minds eye that you can't really remember much of what you read?
<br>
<br>
Is this normal?

If this is a correct assumption, then choosing a destination, without a guided meditation, would work just as well. The common denominator being "Intent" and "Preconceived Destination".

I think that is right. If you have a destination that you can imagine, then you can be there. That is the way Astral portals work in general. The destination could be direct to a locale, or through a symbol such as a rune, or a symbol of the elements or other known symbolic gateway to an Astral realm.
<br>
<br>
Clearly the mind awake/body asleep state is a pre-requisite, and to attain the hypnagogic imagery stage - but before starting, it is in my view as well to hold your "intent" in your mind, and imagine/focus on it at this stage.
<br>

Yes, absolutely, this is the whole point of the training in going through the various stages, etc. What I found is, you have to learn to project slowly before you can project quick. Well, that's how it is with me and I strongly suspect that's how it is with most ordinary people; not having been born with any kind of "gift" for projection.
<br>
<br>
I think of it like if a person was learning to play an instrument. At first you play the various notes at a pace so slow it seems like torture. But with persistance and determination, slowly but surely, things start coming together; to the point where, after a number of years of practice, you could just sit at any old piano and play it, for example.
<br>
<br>
Astral projection rests on the same principles.
<br>
<br>
First you slowly go through the various stages of mental focus in order to be able to recognise them and feel comfortable in the various states. In the process, people will many times get zapped back to C1 as the body adjusts to the new-found environment. But with persistance and determination, eventually you will reach the stage where you just lie back, relax, and simply go directly to the mental Focus state of your choosing.
<br>
<br>
Myself, I'm not quite there yet. But all it takes is more practice, practice &amp; yet more practice.
<br>

<p>
 Yes, you can project directly to the astral,bypassing cinema screen/focus levels etc... as long as you keep your "Intent" of where you want to go.
</p>
<p>
 <br>
 Also, have you been shown books, text on paper that are  placed in front of you too read.  You were able to read the text but being so passive in the minds eye that you can't really remember much of what you read?
</p>
<p>
 Is this normal?
</p>
<p>
 Yes, this is normal, it happened to me more that once, and it's really funny when it happens.. sometimes they are just floating (the books or the paper)slowly by or stable like someone is turning the pages. Sometimes I remember everythings that I read other times just part.
 <br>
 And it's always when I try to look for the author.. things get complicated... and I loose it..
 <br>
 I'll be interested in your story if you want to share, please,PM will be appreciated.

Focus 15,
<br>
<br>
Ok, now I feel better that all these strange experiences are in the ranges of normal
<br>
I would love to share experiences  concerning the books and papers.
<br>
<br>
Mostly they appear like you had said kind of floating in front of me close but not to close to my face.  I gaze upon the text and it seems  sort of fuzzy like I should  squint to obtain a better focus.  After I start to try this,  a feeling (or maybe being told this very quietly) that I am not to really concentrate on the letters but relax.  So I do and the words start flowing in my consciousness as if I'm reading it and in my voice.  My attention is focused, very relaxed, on the page of text.  Even though the words are fuzzy, I am not feeling very taxed at all about  reading it .  Just like you, sometimes  I  remember paragraphs of words and other times not much sticks in my mind.
<br>
<br>
The text being read is (at this point) boring and very routine stuff for some reason.   Things that are considered review.  I haven't written any of the text in my journal yet because the stuff is  "routine". You would think that if you are given something to read in the astral , it should be meaningful or symbolic.
<br>
<br>
Oh well.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Frank,
<br>
<br>
As always, thank you so much for all your help and clarity!
<br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone might know, could a person using these focuses see things that aren't astral in origin?  This morning after waking out of sleep I saw the Earth from a point in space.  The Earth and all her glory was sitting right in front of me with tiny clouds following the jet streams.  It looked so real.
<br>
<br>
Very appriciatively,
<br>

I'd like to thank Frank for explaining the INTENT. I haven't practiced remote viewing yet, but I have stated my intent in a dream. I think dreams can be very powerful. With my last dream, I became lucid, but I thought I was out of body. I went flying around over a lake and through trees. As an experienced lucid dreamer, this was somewhat boring (but beautiful).  Then I remembered to use my intent. At that time I was standing in a European city with a lot of people walking around. As soon as I spoke my words out loud in a strong voice, everyone looked at me in shock. I caught everyone's attention as if I shattered glass in a library! The dream scene changed....and went on from there.      I've been meaning to use Frank's technique for projecting from a LD. I'll let you know how it turns out.

"Ok, I'm realizing more and more how complex the mind is in terms of projection variety and there subtle differences. I was getting confused of whether I am going into Focus 21 or having a remote eye experience because I have been seeing full view close up scenes such as my front door. This is similar during a remote eye situation and the consciousness slams back into the body C1. But reading earlier post says that the door could be symbolic."

Hi Tracy, because there are many who differentiate between "Remote Viewing", "OBE, and "Lucid Dreams", they all have a simple common basis, that is: "The conciousness is outside the body". I have, and do experience all three types of conditions, the easiest to attain for me is Remote Viewing.

Tracy asked:
<br>
"Can a person project directly to the astral, bypass the little cinema screen and just be there?"
<br>
<br>
Yes indeed, I have experienced a shift (a very fast shift), in conciousness during light meditation and found myself in an often visited alternate realm. There I have been a "landlady" for many years to a tenement building. Also in remote viewing, being fully awake and lucid, only sending a body double, or just my conciousness to a desintination, there is only a slight delay between intent and arrival. I am wholely aware of there, and here at the same time. I can describe it aloud or write the experience as I there am physically experiencing it.

Having attended a school in the higher realms for about eight months, I am happy to report that our teacher did not require us to read anything more than recognize a circle representing our consciouness that she/he drew on the blackboard. However we were taken to the library on this campus and told that we could  use it at any time. (I and one other were obe in this school, the other student was newly dead.) The problem I had with the computer screen was that , "I couldn't read a thing!". This was upsetting to me, because there is so much I would have liked to have looked up. But all I could make out was an idea that it was a "search" type database. The words keep blurring and running together, I just gave up in disgust!

 Yes, I have also experienced those very fast shift in conciousness, when doing light meditation or just relaxing while listening to radio or television. Experiencing being there and here at the same time(i'm sure you understand what I mean..:), it normally last a few sec/minute and then the "Jolt" back to my body. I was never really into RV, but it seem to happen once in a while, with complete picture/sense of what is happening. Maybe I should give it a go and let it happened naturally.Will give it a good try one day.

Hi Focus15,
<br>
This school is set in the eithers on the higher realms. It was explained to me that it would be almost impossible for anyone to find by themselves, and that is why a guide "kidnapped" (ha ha) me on the way to a regular group obe meeting. The teacher said that they had "chosen"  us and that the prerequisite to attending was to share what we learned there with others.
<br>
There were many others there on the campus, and many classrooms, also all of the arts, diet, and prophecy, attaining states of conciousness and much more deeply spiritual knowledge was taught.
<br>
I was a wonderful eight months, I quit to pursue opening a business, a year and a half ago. This is the first contact with an e-group since that time.

Oh my gosh,  I  had this same experience through most of my life, even before I  knew anything about energy.   I would be watching tv or listening to someone talk, zone out and have a split consciousness where I am in two places at once.  My physical body is grounded in the physical and another part of me was hovering outside of the body looking down at my physical.
<br>
<br>
When I tried to explain my experience to others, they would look at me and say  "Sure Tracy, it's your imagination working overtime."   Is this something of what you described?  Not knowing anything about oobes or phasing, I never tried to explore or go anywhere, and I have never found myself in the astral until now.

Yes, this is what Robert describes as the "mindsplit effect". It appears to be common with conventional OBE's, as in those cases you are "projecting" an etheric double. If your original mind has Astral sight or you are clairvoyant, you  and your etheric double an then see each other concurrently, and according to Rober it can get most confusing!
<br>
<br>
In your case it seems that you had a spontaneous OBE. There have been cases of motor cycle riders having spontaneous OBE's at hight speed, and were hovering several feet above the bike! That must be disconcerting

<br>
<br>
Bi-location is similar. You can send your double to anywhere you want while your original is fully consciousness.
<br>
<br>
That is also why memory is such a big problem with OBE - the copy, upon its return, has to "download" its copy of its experiences to the original, and mostly it doesn't.
<br>
<br>
That is one reason we are focussing on Astral consciousness phasing in this forum - it avoids these problems and results in a more memorable, beneficial experience.

Adrian,

Wow, I have no idea after all these months of learning, why I never associated these experiences as OBE related.  I just never thought that OBEs could happen just like that.  Since it seems like OBEs have a mass amount of energy involved, that spontaneous OBEs would be  near to impossible.  I remember reading about them in AD but I thought this could only happen to individual who retain high energy levels naturally.
<br>
<br>
All this time of hiding this unnamed experience that no one believed I had, and here I am finally learning about my spiritual self and poof ......it  really has a meaning.

Basically, there is a good way and a not-so-good way to breathe. Quickly take a deep breath in. If your chest immediately begins to rise, you habitually breathe the not-so-good way. If your stomach moves out first, as your diaphragm moves downwards, that is how it should be. (The chest should only rise at the very last stage of a deep breath.)
<br>
<br>
What I was working on, at the time of my original post, was imagining energy flowing from my head, down my spine with each intake of breath (as diaphragm moves downwards). Then, as the diaphragm reaches its bottom limit, you can find a kind of curling sensation coupled with a tingling feeling in the solar plexus area (rather like if you go over a hump-back bridge at speed). If you keep doing this it activates the various Chakras.
<br>
<br>
It was at a time when I got curious about the various sensations you get when bodily Chakras are activated. I found the Heart one is the best. Real whacky sensations.

Concerning conventional obe or the 'etheric double' as some occultist call it.
<br>
RB (and others) explains the mind split scenario etc by suggesting  that your original conciousness stays in your body while a double is generated, goes out scouts around, comes back and downloads the info, so it all seems seemless with out any breaks.
<br>
<br>
I think this is true more or less but I feel that a remote video camera or ROV is a better analogy to use as it feels to me that the experience is more of a 'live feed' than RB suggests (because of the lack of conciousness breaks - I never have a problem with remembering, I'm lucky I guess).
<br>
<br>
I prefer to think of the double as a generated energy vehicle like those ROVs that they send down to ship wreks ete as I feel that there is a 'live feed' from the double back to you, so you see,hear feel etc what the double does, it is your eyes and ears. RB however thinks that the sensation that it is all in real time is an illusion.
<br>
<br>
I think that the downloading part is still important afterwards though because even although there is a 'live feed' between the two bodies at the time the downloading is like saving it to the hard drive so it  is permanatly remembered.
<br>
<br>
To sum up, basically, I agree with what RB says about conventional obe but I think that there is a definate live feed between the two bodies whether RB doesnt suggests this but rather that the memories are downloaded at the end of the experience only.
<br>
<br>
What do others think?

Greetings!
<br>
<br>
A few comments.
<br>
<br>
Yes, Gandalf, I think their is a live feed between the physical mind/body and the etheric double as well, and they can communicate with each other causing the mindsplit effect.
<br>
<br>
Tracy: I am not at all convinced that energy has anything to do with OBE, and certainly not Astral portal work.  The fundamental base state is mind awake/body asleep, and it is quite easy to see how a motorcyclist on a lonely country road can get into this state and have a spontaneous OBE.  I can see energy raising as being or relevance to the etheric OBE - the real time zone - but not Astral travel.   To me, this OBE, etheric double situation is something to be avoided for Astral work. The "holy grail" of Astral projection accoring t most OBE experts is the ability to project at will, and to remember the experience. I do not think conventional OBE offers that, except with years of practice, but I do believe that Astral "phasing" portal work does offer this. It would also seem likely that the pure Astral phasing can provide a higher quality, more stable experience.
<br>
<br>
As for Chakras - we are advised to focus on the upper triangle of Chakras, but in particular the heart Chakra. If you develop the heart Chakra, the other upper Chakra will benefit and develop. The heart Chakra is the key - it is no coincidence that the most powerful force in the Universe, in all Spheres is love!

    Yes, this is what Robert describes as the "mindsplit effect". It appears to be common with conventional OBE's, as in those cases you are "projecting" an etheric double. If your original mind has Astral sight or you are clairvoyant, you  and your etheric double an then see each other concurrently, and according to Rober it can get most confusing!
    <br>
    <br>
    In your case it seems that you had a spontaneous OBE. There have been cases of motor cycle riders having spontaneous OBE's at hight speed, and were hovering several feet above the bike! That must be disconcerting

    Bi-location is similar. You can send your double to anywhere you want while your original is fully consciousness.

  Hi Adrian,
  <br>
  Yes this is what I experience, but my perceptions retain their clarity and I experience little or no confusion. There are times when I "flip*" back to my body and have to immediately make a  fast reconnection to maintain my "there" connection.
  <br>
  (*flip) that part of my conciousness returns to me without my will to recall it.

    That is also why memory is such a big problem with OBE - the copy, upon its return, has to "download" its copy of its experiences to the original, and mostly it doesn't.
    <br>
    <hr height="1" id="quote" noshade=""/>

  <br>
  <br>
  Actually, I am fully lucid in both "places", retaining full memory, and can even record what my body double is experienceing "there" as my "here" body is fully lucid and independent also. This may sound confusing to some, for me it is not.

  What is "Astral consiciousness phasing" ? I have read a lot about these subjects some time ago, but do not recall this term. Also what does the term "Astral Proper" refer to? Again I am not familiar with these terms.

<section>
Greetings Donna!
<br>
<br>
Astral phasing in the context of this forum, is a controlled, phased, method of accessing the Astral through, e.g. a portal, through a state of conscousness, rather than the "conventional OBE" which is the classic exteriorisation fo awareness until the vibrations kick in, and then travelling in an etheric duplicate of yourself.
<br>
<br>
The controlled, phased approach seems to lead to much more controlled, reliable, high quality Astral interaction, and memory recall.  This method allows the "projector" to assume a much higher level of Astral control.
<br>
<br>
The "Astral proper" is something I use to indicate the realms where people usually find themselves after passing on from the physical, and of course there are several levels depending on physical life influences. In Monroe speak, many people would find themselves in "Focus 25".
<br>
<br>
I was excluding the etheric or real-time zone, and the lowest levels of the Astral which correspond to the individual psyche or group subconscious - although they are of course seamless extentions of the Astral.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Hey Douglas, I have felt the same thing! I feel like I have a continuation of conciousness(at least thru the obe to the return) and have seemed to hit the wall at the point of generating the 'double' so many times! that I have wondered what was going on- I have not totally followed this thread because I don't know all the 'focuses', but maybe phasing bypasses the 'double'. Unfortunately I seem not to have aptitude with the visual aspect of the astral, at least not yet, which seems to be a prereq. of phasing.

Phasing does not bypass the etheric double, but rather allows access to the Astral in an alternative way - a way which appears to hold many advantages.
<br>
<br>
For phasing, instead of trying to bring in the vibrations by awareness exteriorisation, you would create a portal to the Astral and shift through it. The doorway could be an existing one, or one you create yourself.

Hi,
<br>
<br>
As I mentioned in another thread - I have difficulty getting to sleep.
<br>
<br>
I have the Monroe Wave 1 CD, and part 5 is the exploration of sleep one. You are meant to play it and leave it on and it will make you fall asleep.
<br>
<br>
What are people's experience of this track in particular. It doesn't work for me - my body is asleep, but my mind is still wide awake.
<br>
<br>
It also seems that it is intended to induce an OBE - the way that Monroe says, 'think how happy it would make you feel to float upwards...' etc...
<br>
<br>
But I would personally want to use it to reduce my insomnia.
<br>
<br>
 Thanks in advance,
 <br>
 <br>
 AJA

Please bear in mind that I specifically reco the Gateway Wave 1 CD tracks 1 &amp; 2 ONLY. Track 1 is the intro to track 2 which you only have to listen to once or twice, then you only need listen to track 2.
<br>
<br>
If you master the transition to Focus 10/12 then you should fairly easily be able to do the rest from your own study. Plus, I regard the way it is all set out in various "Waves" and so forth, as being mere commercialism. Obviously, the final choice is down to each individual. I just wanted to doubly stress my position so there can be no chance of any upsets (those CD sets are mighty expensive).

Greetings Frank- and all Monroe students!
<br>
<br>
Just a quick question.  It is my understanding that use of hemi-sync and other bineural beat technologies leads to a progressive and permanent ability to achieve these states without the CD's and automatically at will.
<br>
<br>
Does the Monroe literature confirm this, and is that the experience of you people?

Hello everyone
<br>
<br>
For me the Discovery Sleep exercise produces a much deeper state of consciousness than any of the other exercises.  After the counting to 20 I'm then in quite a deep trance state just like you are when you are about to fall asleep.  I've never got an out of body experience with this exercise or with any other one, the only times I've ever had out of body experiences are still from within the normal dream state, in the middle of the night.  Some of the exercises from the later waves have produced brief images and visualizations of journeys which took place automatically, though.  I also got to the so called Mental Plane once, though it was not while using one of these exercises. More info is in the Your Gateway Experiences Please topic.
<br>
<br>
Blessings,
<br>
<br>
Brian

<section>
Wow, what a fantastic thread. It ties together a number of experiences I've been having. I am coming at this from a slightly different angle but I think it is relevant - recently I have been doing what some call a type of "channeling" though don't let that word throw you. I don't mean being taken over by some incarnate voice, but rather, what I've been doing sounds like some version of what Frank is talking about. I sit at the computer and get into a slightly meditative state, though it is not blank mind or fully trance/mind-awake-body-asleep. I am fully aware of my body and am even typing as I go. I then quiet my mind and start to describe the first images that come to mind. On many occasions (not always), first a small image will appear then another and then I will then gradually be in an active scene with setting and people and events going on (sometimes there are skips and jumps suddenly from one moment to another within a scene, like jump-cuts in a film) and it will be something that is very surprising to me, nothing I'd intended (though I do have a general intent to "make contact" with guides or even as vague as seeing what is out there). These scenes can get very real. For instance I will see someone riding a horse and then they will notice me and stop and look right at me, realizing I am there, acknowledge me and then say something completely surprising, maybe witty or funny or insightful, and I will respond, and we will then have a dialogue. Sometimes they know me and give me advice. Other times they are people who are dead who are connected to me in some tangential way. But the interractions are very real and when I am done, the acccumulated scenes and dialogues often have messages and deeper meanings in them than I realized at the time. (I can't analyze it while doing it or I lose the connection). Throughout all of this, I am typing and describing what I am seeing or writing down the dialogue verbatim. I have come to recognize that these interractions are real, though because I am in a barely meditative state, it can sometimes get mixed up with my own thoughts, and there will be sentences of gibberish or mind chatter as a result.
<br>
<br>
What is so interesting in relation to this discussion is that it seems that I am making some sort of contact into the astral or beyond realms, but I am doing it while being fully conscious of my physical surroundings and body (even typing, though poorly!). It is very easy to make this connection. I've been interrupted by my cat jumping up and then just closed my eyes and gone right back to it. For a long time I thought I was just making stuff up, until some of the interractions made it pretty clear they were real. For instance, I have done it for someone else and contacted someone they once knew who was dead, without my knowing anything about the person and then later had this confirmed by my living friend.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I am also using Monroe's Gateway series daily and have been a meditator for a long time and have been trying to do a conscious OBE like described by Robert Bruce. What is interesting to me after reading this thread is that I have been operating as if the two things were seperate somehow, that the Bruce type OBE was the valid way to experience consciousness outside of the body and the "channeling" way was not. Now, I am thinking that I need to just combine them (and perhaps type it up after and not during every time).
<br>
<br>
The way I experience these "scenes" sounds somewhat like what Frank is describing, but perhaps not quite as "real". I have always had a vivid imagination and can easily imagine things in a fully rounded, 3D type way, though while "channeling" (I dislike this word for it but it'll have to do for now) it gets even fuller and more real. But I wouldn't describe it as *exactly* like physical life experience. It is still, for me, in that in-the-head, mind-envisioning, movie-screen type of thing.
<br>
<br>
This type of "channeling" is new to me. I've only been doing it like this for a few months now. It seems odd to me, though, after reading this thread, that I could access these "scenes" or astral states while also being so conscious of my physical surroundings. It sometimes seems too easy to be real. Perhaps someone else has some experience with this?
<br>
<br>
Fascinating thread. It really inspires me to bring the two techniques together (why didn't I think of that before!), perhaps by bringing Frank's type of imagery to the Monroe sessions and direct it more. I must admit, I have been definitely trying too much to maintain a blank mind state while using the Monroe tapes, from all those years of meditating with that being the main goal.
<br>
<br>
My goodness, thanks for this thread.
<br>
<br>
If anyone else can make sense of what I might be experiencing I welcome it. It seems like some strange, "lighter" version of Frank's "more real" access to the other realms.
<br>
<br>
Sorry this was so long, but it is very exciting.
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
Pete

<br>
<br>
Pete: What you have described pretty much exactly is Bruce Moen's "focussed attention" method. For more info see:
<a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/
</a>
<br>
<br>
Focussed Attention is a very valid way of connecting with the Astral. With Mr Moen's method, all you do is basically focus your attention inwards and simply go with the flow, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
One of the hurdles with this technique is working out which scenes are valid contact scenes and which are formed from any old mental rambling. To get around this, what Mr Moen does is to teach people to try and contact someone who was close to them and has now passed over. To kickstart the process he encourages people to first use their imagination to create a kind of fantasy scene where they are imagining making contact with that person. Then simply go with the flow of that. Chances are, they will soon come across something or other that happens which was not "on their script".
<br>
<br>
Coming across an unexpected event is taken as a sign that contact has been made. So they simply push along that mental road to see where it will lead.
<br>
<br>
A number of people who have had success at doing this have stumbled across the 3D-Blackness phase of the Monroe mental-focus method and have learnt how to mentally "step into" the scenary they are viewing. Which is basically what I do with my "step into" projection technique. In the sense that, if you were to do exactly as you are doing now only instead you lay down and allowed your physical-body to just drift off to sleep as per normal. Then you should find yourself standing in the Astral somewhere.
<br>
<br>
So with Focussed Attention you are basically focusing along the line of your imagination and becoming open to whatever is being transmitted from the "other side". Problem is, the incoming signals tend to get mixed with all kinds of other mental signals that happen to be floating about - because a person is still very much aware of their physical body. However, someone such as yourself who, from what you say, have a very vivid and clear imagination then you will have far less difficulty isolating the good stuff.
<br>
<br>
You can take this one step further by eliminating the physical-body from the equation. As I say, I have what I call my step-into technique which is all the above, plus, I lay down and simply allow my physical-body to drift off to sleep as per normal. Doing this puts anything Physical right out of the equation, thus allowing a person to mentally travel along the thread of their imagination and pop-out within the Astral somewhere. So, yes, compared to my step-into technique Focussed Attention is a kind of step-into
<i>
 Lite
</i>
.
<br>
<br>
The next step (continuing in software terms) would be step-into
<i>
 Pro
</i>
i.e. a full-blown obe in the traditional style of Robert Bruce et al. Here you have all of the above, plus, at the point of travelling along the thread of your imagination, you activate what Mystics call the Crown Chakra. Doing this causes a person to pop-out from within themselves into a region commonly called the real-time zone.
<br>
<br>
Here you can sample the delights of flying over the rooftops in your locality, or entering the Astral by flying through all kinds of Astral Plane Entrance Structures of the like you see portrayed on the back cover of Astral Dynamics, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

I am intrigued by this "step-into" technique. I assume it has evolved from your Gateway work? In any case, it would be most interesting to hear more.

That is definitely a major cornerstone of phasing. But I think it is true to say that with most people, the mind falls asleep first, followed by the body sometime later. If it were possible to reliably cause the physical body to go to sleep while keeping the mind fully awake, then many more people will have alot of success with phasing. Any pointers for people to follow in this regard would be most useful.
<br>
<br>
BTW - I know that you used to do more of an OBE type approach before moving to phasing - do you find that your quality of Astral presence, i.e. your ability to see Astral residents and equally importantly they to see you and communicate with each other, and the general realism of the environment is as good of better with phasing than OBE?
<br>
<br>
Thanks again.

<section>
Thanks Frank. Very interesting. I will look into Moen's work.
<br>
<br>
I have read the whole thread, so I don't think I am asking you to repeat anything, pardon me if so, but how then is the experience of the traditional OBE and the experience of being there by phasing-in or stepping-in different from each other? It sounds like you are saying the end result of getting outside the body in these two ways is different somehow. (I understand that the two techniques for getting outside the body are different).
<br>
<br>
Adrian, yes I agree that getting to the mind awake, body asleep state seems to be the hardest part. I don't know if I've ever fully gotten there, except once spontaneously and maybe a second time the other night, though it didn't feel fully there either. That's got to be the biggest stumbling block.
<br>
<br>
Also, Frank, about the Monroe tapes. I notice that the Gateway Series only takes you up to Focus 21. (I'm on Wave III). How then do you get training for Focus 22 and beyond? How did you?
<br>
<br>
I wrote the Monroe Institute and enclosed below is their response (for others who might be interested). It does sound a bit commercial to me, a way to make you buy more. Any suggestions on how else to learn the Focus 22 and beyond levels? Do you have any experience with the Going Home series? I understand it is meant for terminally ill situations and doesn't quite sound appropriate:
<br>
<br>
The Monroe Institute wrote:
<br>
"Focus levels are different states of consciousness.  You are correct, the higher focus levels are available only in the Residential programs.
<br>
 <br>
 Anyone can use the Going Home series, however it is not designed like the Gateway Experience series.  The focus levels are there, but they are not explained like they are in the GE series.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Lifeline Program at TMI offers higher focus levels, you can read more about it by visiting this link,
 <a class="bbc_link" href="http://www.monroeinstitute.org/programs/lifeline.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  http://www.monroeinstitute.org/programs/lifeline.html

 .  You must take a Gateway Voyage Program before moving on to Graduate Programs (such as Lifeline)."

  I am intrigued by this "step-into" technique. I assume it has evolved from your Gateway work? In any case, it would be most interesting to hear more.

Yes, the technique evolved from my Gateway work. But the technique is basically as described on this thread: where you create a mental scenario (either with or without some kind of recording to aid you) then, as the physical-body drifts off to sleep, your conscious awareness lets go of the Physical and you mentally step-into the imagined scenario.

   I lay down and simply allow my physical-body to drift off to sleep as per normal.

  <br>
  <br>
  That is definitely a major cornerstone of phasing. But I think it is true to say that with most people, the mind falls asleep first, followed by the body sometime later. If it were possible to reliably cause the physical body to go to sleep while keeping the mind fully awake, then many more people will have alot of success with phasing. Any pointers for people to follow in this regard would be most useful.

<br>
Yes, you are exactly right. It is a very tricky mental balancing act to perform which generally takes a lot of practice.
<br>
<br>
With me, like this morning for instance, I can lay back and within ten or fifteen minutes I'm off... hello Astral, goodbye Physical. Yet, most mornings it will take me at least an hour to get myself in the requisite frame of mind. (Sometimes it will take me 2 hours, plus.) But once I'm in that "frame of mind" it's Astral-projection city, like I can't get away from the place.
<br>
<br>
The big research question in my mind these days is why the difference? Like, why can't I just lay back and simply make direct contact?
<br>
<br>

  <br>
  BTW - I know that you used to do more of an OBE type approach before moving to phasing - do you find that your quality of Astral presence, i.e. your ability to see Astral residents and equally importantly they to see you and communicate with each other, and the general realism of the environment is as good of better with phasing than OBE?
  <br>
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
For a while I went away from the traditional approach and researched the Gateway products. I found that by practising the Phasing approach had the effect of overwriting the original data to a large degree and I lost touch with my past efforts. Lately, however, I have successfully managed to marry the two approaches.
<br>
<br>
My early "cannonball exit" so-called because it felt like being shot from a cannon and landing within the Astral someplace (without any degree of control at all) I have managed to temper with my current Phasing techniques. So now it doesn't really make all that much difference whether I Phase to the Astral in one smooth mental transistion; or whether I take the more traditional approach and enter via the RTZ from flying through some Astral Plane Entrance Structure.
<br>
<br>
The latter is, of course, more exciting and naturally more difficult for people to manage generally. Which is one of the main hiccups of the technique.

Greetings Frank!
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your further advice - most interesting indeed!
<br>
<br>
So basically then  - it seems to be a matter of maintaining imagery in the mind while waiting for the body to fall off to sleep?
<br>
<br>
That makes a great deal of sense of course, and is in full accord with the entire concept phasing generally. If you wouldn't mind a couple of followup questions:
<br>
<br>
1) Is this best practiced on going to bed at night, or after waking up early in the morning? I know that you used to awake around 04:00 or so for your Astral travels. But if tired, I would guess that this method would work at bedtime if it is possible to keep the mind awake.
<br>
<br>
2) Most  importantly - what sort of imagery does one maintain while awaiting for the body to go to sleep? E.g. would it be a full blown scenario like acting out a scene, or simply maintaining a static scene?
<br>
<br>
All of this really is extremely useful!
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

Ginny is our resident Moen-expert who has studied his work and successfully used his techniques, and Mr Moen also runs a message board where you can ask questions, etc. Myself I only have limited knowledge of his work. But I got the jist of where he was coming from quite quickly and found the technique to be a very valid way of exploring.

  how then is the experience of the traditional OBE and the experience of being there by phasing-in or stepping-in different from each other? It sounds like you are saying the end result of getting outside the body
  <br>
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
First, I too find myself unable to get on with certain terms and/or phrases. I dislike the phrase "outside the body". Because it only seems like you are "outside" of your body. If anything, you have gone
<u>
 within
</u>
yourself more, as opposed to being outside of yourself.
<br>
<br>
With the Phasing technique, performed properly, there is one smooth mental transition from Physical to Astral. There's no sensation of being "outside the body" (for want of a better phrase) in the sense of flying over rooftops in your locality, or floating around your bedroom ceiling looking down at yourself sleeping, etc. It simply feels like you are in exactly the same "body" only your surroundings changed. Monroe first coined the term and, being an engineer, he naturally thought of the smooth transition he had come to experience as a phase-shift, hence the term Phasing.

  <br>
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<b>
 The main difference is in how you experience the Physical to Astral transition.
</b>
<br>
<br>
With Mr Moen's Focussed Attention you never experience a full Physical to Astral transition. And it is precisely this transition that presents a major stumbling block for all manner of reasons. The main one being your general sense of conscious awareness acts like a fish out of water thus sending your protective sense of awareness into overdrive. All manner of panic-buttons are pressed and the whole experience turns to meltdown.
<br>
<br>
Fear is the most common emotion to have at the onset of any non physical-reality based experience. Well, at first that is. Naturally, someone having success at the Moen Focussed Attention technique may well feel a little nervous at having confirmed contact will old aunty Agatha, or whomever, long-since passed away. But because their conscious awareness is always primarily grounded in the Physical, any feelings of apprehension, nervousness, fear, and such like, are released within the Physical realm and not the Astral. This means they will not be subject to the kinds of reality fluctuations they would be subject to, if these kinds of feelings or emotions were released within the Astral environment.
<br>
<br>
With Phasing you experience a direct Physical to Astral transition. Like I say above, there's no sensation of being "outside the body" (again for want of a better phrase) in the sense of flying over rooftops in your locality, or floating around your bedroom ceiling looking down at yourself sleeping, etc. It simply feels like you are in exactly the same "body" only your surroundings changed.
<br>
<br>
With traditional obe another factor comes into play in the sense the Crown Chakra (for want of a better term) becomes very active. Whereas, with normal Phasing I do not feel the Crown to be active at all - just the Brow.
<br>
<br>
An active Crown is felt as a buzzing kind of vibration and/or feelings of static electricity running through the body. The intensity and/or pitch of this buzzing or vibration determines where you eventually end up. At a particular level of intensity, you will be subjected to feelings of leaving your physical body. I mean in a literal sense where you feel like you are actually leaving the physical body behind. Hence the term Out of Body.
<br>
<br>
With traditional obe you generally project into what is known as the Real-Time Zone or RTZ. It is called this because, when projected into this realm, you are able to view events that are currently happening on planet Earth. However, the RTZ is actually an infinitely huge buffer zone between Astral-matter and ALL Physical-matter.
<br>
<br>
Within this zone or realm, you can see interconnections between the various states of matter that take the form of all manner of tube structures and consequent energy vortices which you can travel down. (Though this is *not* for the squeamish.) All kinds of 3D Grid formations can be viewed together with what are commonly called Astral Plane Entrance Structures: of the kind portrayed on the back cover of Astral Dynamics.

  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>

</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I got into this whole topic from chance coming across Monroe's JOB over 20 years ago. I figured the guy was either insane or had stumbled onto something. I gave his techniques a fair try and, much to my surprise, began getting projection symptoms. Everything I learnt was from ordinary trial and error. But I have to say that, only up until a few years ago, I viewed the Astral as just this huge adventure playground which I visited 2 or 3 times per week.
<br>
<br>
Since then I've managed to put some polish on my techniques from clues given to me from visiting various websites and from reading Astral Dynamics and Monroe's two later works... Far journeys and Ultimate Journey. Plus, the Internet has enabled me to pool experiences and/or ideas with a number of experienced explorers, which has benefited me greatly. I also became open to the concept of "guides" which accelerated my progress no end.
<br>
<br>
As far as the TMI and the Gateway series CD's are concerned, my personal opinion is they go off on a commercial tangent after Wave 1. I think most ordinary people who could get to Mental Focus 12 could make good progress from material that is available on BBS's such as this one for free.

<section>
Thanks Frank for the thoughtful response. I do appreciate it.
<br>
<br>
I agree with you about the Monroe tapes. They withhold the training for the higher levels in a way that draws more money out of you. It is not necessary to use their methods though, obviously. In any case, however, I am finding that the use of the Gateway Series so far seems to be enabling me to reach the trance state better and more fully. The last couple nights I think I actually got into a trance, though perhaps not quite deep enough. Last night, I began to feel a sort of sudden rush of sensory input once in the trance and it did spark my mind to race which brought me out of it. I did, however, have a moment where I heard a wonderful beautiful female voice say, "hello".
<br>
<br>
I had asked for a guide to meet me and help me, and I agree, I think this makes a huge difference. One reason for that, I think, which I have learned from doing the focussed attention method, is that the beings you contact also bring their energy to the contact and this can help to raise your energy so you meet in the middle, so to speak, at least that's the way I think of it. The more vibrant, wise and vivid a being that is there to help you or to make contact with you, the more vivid the experience, oftentimes.
<br>
<br>
Have you posted to this forum some of your experiences while "out of the body"? I'd be curious to hear about some of them.
<br>
<br>
I've got some research to do on Moen's work and I want to go back and re-look at Monroe's later books to read more about phasing. I read the books years ago and need a referesher.
<br>
<br>
Thanks again and happy traveling.

Well, the mind as such never sleeps. Problem is the sense of conscious awareness usually drifts off about the same time as the physical body. The "sense of conscious awareness" is a kind of inbetween entity that can be with one, or the other. From physical birth this entity becomes latched with the physical body to a high degree. So physical-body asleep... sense of conscious awareness asleep: physical-body awake... sense of conscious awareness awake.
<br>
<br>
The trick is to break that cycle and realise that the sense of conscious awareness can be with one, or the other.

I am no expert at being able to do this at will. I have to create certain fairly exacting conditions before that transition to "the other" can take place. With me I find it more fruitful to practise early morning. Others may find the opposite, or whatever else inbetween.

Basically, whatever works for the person in question. The BIG problem is breaking the cycle. There is a natural tendency where, if a person tries to keep their sense of conscious awareness alive, this will prevent the physical body from going to sleep. So a sort of battle ensues to the extent where tiredness will naturally take over.
<br>
<br>
However, there is this definite, inbetween road that is a tricky mental balancing act to follow. In a nutshell, you let the physical body just drift off to sleep as per normal: but you keep your sense of conscious awareness focussed within you.

I am just beginning to experience that mind awake body asleep state. I did it once spontaneously and now twice in the last few days, though it doesn't feel quite deep enough yet. The other night, I was rushed with sensory stuff, sounds, whatever, and couldn't maintain any imagery of my own at that point. (I then heard a distinct female voice say "hello", and I came out of it). It is a very interesting state, and very different from the deep meditative empty mind state which I can reach pretty easily now.
<br>
<br>
So does it mean then that if you were to have a regular amount of sleep hours in that trance state that you would then not need anymore sleep? The mind then doesn't need any sleep? Is that true? I hadn't thought of that before.
<br>
<br>
Being clear on that might make me more relaxed and accepting of the state. That is, if I'm not losing any "sleep" then what the heck, just keep playing with it all night if I want - in theory of course. Plus, if I keep myself going at it then eventually my body will start to drop off anyway as it gets progressively tired. (If of course I can keep my mind from dropping off with it).

LOL: this happened to me too. I'd previously lumped the whole idea of guides in a big box marked "Mystical Mumbo-Jumbo Do Not Open." So when coming around to the idea I mentally said out loud, "Okay guide or guides, if you are really there watching me from the "other side" (so to speak) then just flaming well make yourself known. I want no fancy robes and halos and all that jazz, just come out from wherever you are and say hello. A few seconds later this voice came into mind, as clear as day, and said: "Hello Frank". It shocked me to the extent where I zapped back to Physical double-quick.

Oh, being rushed with sensory stuff like sounds of voices, or music, or hearing any old popping, banging or stomping, or whatever;  abstract mental images like outline drawings of all kinds of shapes, or faces of humans or animals; bright areas of blackness that seem like some kind of light in the distance, or seeing swirling foggy colours; having the blackness take on varying textures, and so on: this is the Monroe Mental Focus 12 state.

Yes, I am pleased someone else has made that observation. I could never quite understand what people who were into "meditation" were trying to achieve. From what I can gather, the goal is to work towards a state where the mind is completely blank. But in the midst of me making the Phased transition between Physical and Astral my mind is anything but blank.
<br>
<br>
Also, something someone posted the other week about Monks and their wanting to attain a state where they are within themselves looking at what was described as a white screen. Immediately I recognised what the person in question was saying. I used to get that quite often and it was a flaming nuisance to be honest. Because there I'd be after maybe an hour and a half of working towards getting my physical-body out of the mental equation, I'd just be getting to thinking that I was transitioning nicely and the Astral was about to come into view, and then plop: all I'd get was this blank white screen that I couldn't seem to get rid of.
<br>
<br>
It reminds me of the people who post saying they have, "suffered" what they call, "sleep paralysis" all their lives. Oh, how I would dearly love to "suffer" this condition in an instant every day: instead of spending 1 hour+ trying to bring myself to experience it. In a similar vein, I couldn't help chuckling over the thought of all those Monks spending perhaps years trying to attain something which used to "pester" me so regularly.

All the evidence I have gathered from years of personal experimentation and observation strongly suggests to me that each individual is, in fact, their Mind. In other words, what we call "our mind" is actually us, and is a totally separate entity that exists independently of the physical body and has no need for sleep; only the physical body has any need for sleep due to the fact that the cells that form it have a certain sell-by date.
<br>
<br>
To my mind, successful Astral projection is not so much to do with finding the right "technique" but is all to do with achieving the correct degree of mental understanding. For me, realising that the physical-body springs forth from the Mind, and not the other way around, was a *major* turning point for me which led to my making a big leap forward in my development.

I've thought about this myself. I worked for a long time to be able to achieve the blank mind state. Now that it is relatively easy, I wonder what the fuss was about. However, I think for some people and for me when I was younger, some ten years or so ago, there can be so much emotional and mental stuff to work through that it can be really difficult to get the mind quiet, especially when it is fueled by strong emotions, grief, fear, etc. The effort to clear the mind and reach that state also acts to heal those emotional issues, both while practicing the meditation and otherwise when preparing to meditate. Once I started to "mature" and get some of these strong issues resolved within, I was able to reach the blank mind state. Also, before I knew as much about the astral world, I liked to get to the blank mind in order to then see what would happen, what was there, experience the sounds, images, feelings of expanded awareness, etc. Now I know more consciously what these things are and what I'm going for. It's possible that even though some people are "monks" they still don't really know that much about what's out there and what's actually happening. I agree, though, I don't know why anyone would just want to endlessly stay in the blank mind state. All in all though I guess I feel it is a great tool especially in those times when I have a lot of calming down to do.
<br>
<br>
On another subject, I wanted to say this: in the terms used in Astral Dynamics, what exactly is happening in the phasing in process that is different than the AD classic OBE where "consciousness reflects itself into the expanding etheric body", in other words, creating a copy of itself in the etheric body. What then is occuring in the phasing in process and why does this allow for greater memory retention? Is consciousness projecting itself rather than copying itself (so no download of information to the original consciousness is necessary)? If so, why not project consciousness into the etheric body rather than copy it? Is this possible? If it is possible, would doing this create the best of both worlds, ie: the full body classic OBE with the full memory retention. Or is the phasing in experience the so similar to the classic OBE experience that there is no reason to try to "blend them"? If the two techniques led to the same experience in the end, then there wouldn't be any reason to do the classic OBE of copying consciousness to the etheric body unless one wanted to explore the RTZ for some reason or experience the process itself of exiting and creating a copy of consciousness into an etheric body. I hope this is making sense. The question I am posing, then, is that we have a pretty detailed explanation of what is happening in the classic Bruce OBE where we make a consciousness copies itself into the etheric - what woud be the detailed explanation of what is happening when we phase into an OBE experience? Anyone have any thoughts on that?
<br>

Hi All,
<br>
I`ve started having success projecting in the last 10 days and seemed to have stumbled onto Frank`s "step into" technique, quite by accident.I lay down one afternoon to take a nap.After laying on my back for about 45 minutes and becoming very relaxed I rolled onto my right side and after about 10 minutes felt strong vibrations and projected to the RTZ: a first for me.I had a short experience floating around my house.The interesting thing was that it happened spontaneously-I wasn`t trying to project.I thought it was a fluke occurence.However, I tried the same process the next two days and had two more RTZ
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///projections.my" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 projections.My
</a>
main interest is in the Astral and by placing an intent to go there at the point in the sequence when I roll onto my right side I`ve had four AP`s.

Four months ago I bought the Gateway 1-7 CD`s and have been doing two exercises every day before going to sleep. I also do NEW techniques along with the CD`s.These projections coincided with my beginning to go to  focus 21 along with opening primairy centers.However I can`t seem to project while using the CD`s though I feel I`m close. Now that I know the state I have to reach to project the hemi-synch might be a block.I tend to think too much when I`m listening.
<br>
Anyway, to say I`m pleased would be an understatement!I`m a big fan of the "step-into" technique.I don`t want to over-analyze it at this point. I`m afraid of letting my thinking get in the way of my intuition and
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///feeling.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

</a>
`s a subtle,tricky place to get to. In my case I got where I wanted to go when I relaxed and stopped trying to force it.I hope it keeps working.

As always thanks to Frank! I`ve learned more from your posts than all the books I`ve read combined.

What then is occuring in the phasing in process and why does this allow for greater memory retention?.......

With me, I tend not to get wrapped up in the body-forming process. I merely let the natural process "do its thing" so to speak, as my main area of focus is destination Astral realms. The way I look at it, is you don't need to know how a car functions exactly in order to drive someplace. All a person need know is how and when to push and pull the various levers, and after an appropriate time they arrive at their destination.
<br>
<br>
In other words, I don't have too much experience in this area of observation. Though what I can say for sure is the Phasing process is much easier to bear. In the sense that it is one thing thinking about bobbing around your ceiling looking down at your physical-body, or flying through some Astral-Plane Entrance Structure of the kind seen on the back cover of Astral Dynamics: but it is quite another thing actually doing it! With Phasing, there is generally less trauma and/or excitement associated with the Process. And any kind of trauma or excitement will inevitably lead to a person suffering severe reality fluctuations that turn their whole experience into a complete mish-mash.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I find affects memory recall *considerably* is falling asleep directly following the experience. I still do this now and again which turns a great projection, full of vivid memories, into some event I can hardly recall upon awakening.

  Hi All,
  <br>
  I`ve started having success projecting in the last 10 days and seemed to have stumbled onto Frank`s "step into" technique, quite by accident.I lay down one afternoon to take a nap.After laying on my back for about 45 minutes and becoming very relaxed I rolled onto my right side and after about 10 minutes felt strong vibrations and projected to the RTZ: a first for me.I had a short experience floating around my house.The interesting thing was that it happened spontaneously-I wasn`t trying to project.

<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are making great progress, well done to you.
<br>
<br>
Funny, how you describe it is basically how it happened with me the first time. I remember how, years ago, I used to go to bed "armed" with all manner of variations that I was going to try that night-release-morning. All to no avail (or so I thought). Then, one morning, it just happened in very much the same way as yourself. Once I knew the feeling, I largely put aside all the other ideas I'd had and concentrated on searching out for that same feeling again.
<br>
<br>
As you say, it is a subtle and tricky place of consciousness to get to, so I had to persevere quite a bit before I "found it" again. But if you stick at it, you'll find it does get a fraction easier each time. What I admire about your methodology is the way in which you have mixed a number of approaches: taking the Intent aspect of the Moen school, coupled with the Monroe Hemi-Sync and Robert Bruce's energy work all mixed with a large dollop of your own intuition and feeling... sounds like a great recipe for success you have there!
<br>
<br>
You are also very right about not analysing your experience too much. Simply concentrate on homing-in on that feeling.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>
Frank

<section>
Frank,
<br>
Would you mind explaining more about the transition from Focus 10 to Focus 12? I think I am managing to reach Focus 10 (though I am not always sure whether my body is asleep exactly). At this point, I have the most success using the Wave I excercise 2 tape as you described earlier on this forum. So, do you stop the tape and then try for Focus 12 or do you finish the exercise and then get back to Focus 10 and then 12 on your own? (Which would mean I will have more success once I can reach Focus 10 as deeply on my own).
<br>
<br>
I seem to keep reaching a sort of overwhelming input of sensory sounds, images, etc, though I'd describe it more like I suddenly just woosh as if getting on some sort of roller coaster, losing awareness of my body, a sudden letting go completely, which is so "sweeping-me-off-my-feet" that I keep snapping back to what I assume is Focus 10. So, I guess my main question is how to make this transition? Is there a way to slow it down or make it be less startling? I can understand how you pause at the door to Focus 12 while using the tapes and then return as instructed. But how did you start entering Focus 12 and staying there for awhile?
<br>
<br>
I agree that the Focus 10 to 12 transition isn't much on the Gateway tapes. So that isn't much help. Do you think they expect that by merely thinking or saying 12 that you will arrive at that level? Doesn't seem very helpful for a beginner.
<br>
<br>
coral1 - good work! you sound like a natural.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>

<section>
Frank,
<br>
A little more on my last post -
<br>
Monroe seems to describe Focus 21 as the "edge of time and space", the last level of physical world reality, "the edge that lies between the physical world and the afterlife" (to quote Moen). I've been thinking of Focus 12 as that edge. Could it be that I am leaping/swooshing right from Focus 10 to Focus 21 and beyond and it is striking me as a huge, overwhelming move? Are Focus 12 (and 15), more preliminary levels? Maybe I'm conceptualizing them incorrectly. Though I know it is not a science exactly, perhaps my ideas are making it more difficult. Perhaps I need to slow it down and make myself linger in 12 for awhile. So, how do you perceive the difference between the Focus 12 and 21 (and beyond) levels? You seem to discuss 12 as being in the astral realms and "beyond the physical world". Can you help me clarify this a bit? Thanks.
<br>
<br>
(I have another similar, if more minor, confusion of definitions when in track 2 of the Wave I tape, Monroe instructs to relax each body part in turn before then counting down to 10. I had to re-write my scenario a few times to make sure I didn't give up my "body" until after that massage/relaxaton part. I had been leaving my physical body at the energy conversion box at first and this created a jarring problem. I've got that straightened out now I think. The way I see it is I don't leave my physical body behind until after the relaxation and during the countdown when I have to leave it behind pretty fast.)

Hi Pete
<br>
You`re the one that`s a natural!The rollercoaster you describe sounds like a projection to
<a class="bbc_link" href="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums///me.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
 me.It
</a>
can be frightening and disorienting at first but with practice it gets easier.Once you come to know what to expect, I found it becomes much easier to keep control.When the going gets weird, I try to keep a sense of cool detachment from the proceedings.I believe that "letting go" is an important part of this whole business and with a little practice you`ll get the feel for a smoother transition.
<br>
I`ve done hemi-synch for four months and don`t worry to much about what number focus level I`m at.What I percieve as 10 or 12 could be completely different for you.I`ll often ignore the voice prompts on the CD.I`ll shift to a different focus level when it FEELS right.Most nights I`ll listen to two exercises back to back and take my time relaxing,raising energy and getting a good level of trance.I have yet to reach the Astral while listening to Monroe but I`m so close sometimes I can taste it! I wish you continued success.

<section>
coral1,
<br>
Your right, I shouldn't make too big a deal about what number level I'm at or not at. It's a part of my trying to make sense, interpret what is happening. I keep having all sorts of things occur but nothing that I can say is actually out of my body or exactly like waking, physical life. Some images and flashes and sounds are more real than others but it's always in my mind's eye and never "exactly" like real life.
<br>
<br>
I think I am just starting to get the mind awake, body asleep thing, but even that has various types to it and I find it difficult to determine what exactly is happening. For instance, I was in what I thought was that trance state and so I thought I'd open my eyes to see what it would be like and it was, well, like sitting in a chair with my eyes open - so my body was asleep - it didn't feel like any big deal. So I guess I have to have my eyes closed and looking inward for "things" to happen?
<br>
<br>
It's not uncommon for me to get flashes of images and even small scenes playing out, but you know, I can get those while just sitting at my desk and closing my eyes and just clearing my mind a little, I don't need a deep trance. I guess Moen calls this focused attention. I'm not sure of the difference between that and Focus 12 and Focus 21 and being out of the body or being in Focus 21 and yet still in the body, etc, etc.
<br>
<br>
Well, at least something is happening. Letting go is the biggest part of it, I think. I'll just keep plugging away. Thanks for the advice. I guess you're right and that's what I am doing too, jumping all around as it feels right, probably Focus this then Focus that then back to C1 then out again...whew.
<br>
<br>
Oh, I did hear a sound this time, again (I did once before too the other night). It was like noise, like hearing a splash of someone's stereo playing too loud for just a second, like something trying to get through and just bleeping through for a second. It was really loud. Strange.

<br>
Focus 10 is basically described as, "mind awake, body asleep" but in practice things are not quite so clear-cut. I found it is very easy to get caught in a Catch-22 here. Because the more you check to see if your body is asleep, the more it stays awake. So a sort of battle ensues. Following which it's only a matter of time before natural tiredness takes over.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I would now describe Focus 10 as the state where you are focussed away from your physical body to the extent that you are not thinking about it at all. In that, your whole focus of attention is pointed within your mind; and you become engrossed by that to the extent where any notion of a physical body just drops out of the equation. To me, that is focus 10.
<br>
<br>
Though please no-one get me wrong, here. I'm not going against Monroe or saying he was mistaken or anything like that. On the contrary, I believe both he and I are explaining the same basic state but in different ways. Problem with me was the word "asleep" as in mind awake, body asleep. My consciousness was just *so* fixated with the idea of body asleep, sense of consciousness asleep, that I had to think in different terms in order to break that cycle.

The Focus 10 rundown I only ever used as a kind of preconditioner to projection. Many times I felt I could just let go of the commentary and be off. But I resisted the temptation. I've listened to the Focus 10 rundown easily a thousand times in various situations. The most effective, I believe, is on low-volume repeat while asleep. From my studies I can say absolutely that Bob's rundown holds a particular resonance within the Astral.

Well, normally, any feeling of snapping back brings you to C1 not F10. From what you say it sounds to me like you get to F10 and, after whatever time, you make a definite transition to F12: at which point your protective sense of awareness slaps the brakes on and zaps you back to C1. That being the case, what you are feeling is very normal. All you need to do is convince your protective sense of awareness that all is well and to just go along with the ride, so to speak.

It's just a case of practice. Slowing it down is what I set out to do about a year ago. Now I've begun to get it about right. If you are like me then you have about a year of practice ahead of you. If you are twice as good then 6 months... or whatever.

  <br>
  <hr height='"1"' id='"quote"' noshade=""/>
 </font>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
I can well understand why you think that way because I too once thought Focus 12 was that edge. And this touches on what you say below about everything happening in a whoosh. That's exactly what used to happen with me. When I looked back from the point of being within the Astral, the last stage I really remembered was being at Focus 12. So that's why for a while I thought Focus 12 was the bridge zone. It's only when you slow the whole transition process down yet further that you realise there are several, fairly distinct inbetween states.
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 is characterised by what is often called 3D-Blackness. Basically, you find yourself floating in an endless, timeless void. Which is the bridge zone between Physical and Astral. It's quite a comforting place once you get used to it. Though people who "suffer" what is sometimes called "sleep paralysis" can find themselves within this region not knowing quite what is happening. And, for them, it can be quite scary.
<br>
<br>
Focus 21 is the first of the realms of reality where: Thought = Direct Action. Which is why people, such as Ginny for example, tend to use it as a start-point for their Astral journey. For in this region all you have to do is either Think about where you want to go, or place some strong Intent about what you want to achieve, or to experience... and it automatically comes about. Normally, what happens is some kind of portal will open in the blackness and you simply place the Intent to go in that direction.
<br>
<br>
The reasoning behind Monroe's talk about being on the "edge of time and space" is all to do with the Physical realm where we hold notions of Time and Space, and of course Distance. Within the Physical, these three notions are inextricably linked. However, within the Astral there is no such thing as Time. So there is no such thing as Distance or Space either.

<br>
<br>
Yes, you need to slow it down as touched on above. Once you can make the transition slowly you will perceive the inbetween states. With me, Focus 15 is a very interesting and subtle state where I experience a mental null. It's next to impossible to explain in words but you pass through a phase where it does just seem like all of Time just stands still, or it can seem like Time is moving with you. Which I'm sure makes no sense at all. Like I say, it's next to impossible to explain in words.

Quick question.  My approach to exit technique(s) and levels of awareness, etc. is much more, umm, how can I describe it?  Well, less seperate, more fluid...less structured, but I definetly see the benefits of breaking it up in "Focus" levels.
<br>
<br>
My question is this, I want to start understanding more about Gateway type excercises.  Do you have CD set or do you just study this kind of breakdown?

Quick amendment: you obviously have the CD, is it really worth it?  I want to burn them (copy them) because I am such a poor college student, but I also love Monroe and the Institute...so I would feel bad...anyway, I do have one of their CD's, which I purchased, but I am interested in the Wave set....I just want to make sure that it's going to help me.  My OBEs are hit and miss and for me it depends how much FOCUS I put in to it, and during the school year I am just so busy with research, writing, etc.

Dan: As much as I would like to be able to give you a definitive answer, it is not easy for me to decide for you whether or not the Cd's would be worth it. I have the whole set, but I reckon the Wave-1 CD is the one people should buy if money is tight and they want to dip a toe in the Gateway water, so to speak.
<br>
<br>
After all, it is the only CD out of that whole set which I found useful. But that doesn't mean to say such experience is necessarily going to be the same with everyone, and I'm not saying the rest are rubbish or anything like that. I'm just simply reporting my experiences.
<br>
<br>
If you have the opportunity of getting a copy then maybe give Wave-1 a fair go. I'll be happy to give you any pointers I feel may help.
<br>
<br>
Yours,
<br>

Hello Frank,
<br>
<br>
First of all I must say that just like someone above mentioned, I overwhelmingly learned from you and from this giant thread more than I learned from any book in the past.
<br>
<br>
Now, I do have tons of questions about everything, but as right now I can only guess what F10/12/21 feel like, I'll wait with my questions until I actually try out and practice everything. Always best to try and learn myself [
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
]
<br>
I do have a really good visualization ability, and I usually integrate everything from visuals to sounds to smells to tastes to touch into what I imagine. I think that all people who play (or used to play) a lot of role playing games (not on the computer) should have a really good visualization ability..
<br>
<br>
Last night I listened to the Wave I tracks 1+2 for the first time. I don't think I managed to get into F10, but my whole body (except for the middle of my chest for some reason) tingled pleasantly this time; on previous times when I tried meditating/trancing, only my feet and hands would tingle, and so strongly that it was downright uncomfortable.
<br>
As I continue practicing, the next step should be when suddenly the tingling would stop and I'll stop feeling my body?
<br>
<br>
Oh, and another question: when going through the F10 exercise, and visualizing myself going through it, I have something like a running commentary but as if from my visualized self's side. For example, when I reached the F3 stone last night, there was a small levitating purple velvet pillow above it. I (visualized) myself sitting down on it, and when I touched that pillow with my hands I said to myself: "ooh, silky" (as it really was silky
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
. Is that ok, or should I try to visualize only images/sounds/smells/etc and not say things to myself as I'm actually there? I hope that made some sense..
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Daniel

Just thought of another question.
<br>
<br>
Have you tried phasing into the RTZ?

<section>
Greetings Noxerus,
<br>
<br>
Frank is certainly the best person to answer your questions, but I would like to comment on your question regarding phasing into the RTZ - specifically I personally do not think that would be possible.
<br>
<br>
The RTZ is actually an etheric projection rather than a full Astral projection, and is accordingly really a transient state between physical and Astral. Phasing is a projection of consciousness directly to the Astral via a series on intermediate states of consciousness, none of which appear to involve the etheric state.
<br>
<br>
RTZ - an etheric projection - is usually achieved by means of conventional OBE involving a projection of the etheric body.
<br>
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
<br>
Adrian.

<br>
Focus 10 is basically the same mental state as when a person is completely absorbed when watching a movie, for instance; where their attention has been captivated to the extent they are neither aware of the room they are in, nor the chair upon which they sit.
<br>
<br>
Only difference being, your attention is captivated by the imagery you are perceiving in your mind's eye. And, at the point of being internally absorbed, this is Focus 10.
<br>
<br>
From Focus 10 you should naturally make a quick and seamless transition to Focus 12. This is where all kinds of abstract imagery can come about; together with all manner of sounds such as, pops, bangs, Velcro-like tearing sounds, and even music.
<br>
<br>
These events seem to just come about at random. For example, I hadn't heard anything for a while, just visuals. However, this morning I heard a loud series of knocks and, next moment, someone shouted my name at the top of their voice. What all that was about I have no idea.
<br>
<br>
Another example which sticks in mind, came about the other week: after the coloured foggy mist I normally perceive at Focus 12, all I got was a picture of a man of about 60 years of age repeatedly trying to tell me something. He was at the window of a small wooden building about 10 or 15 feet away. I could see his mouth moving but couldn't hear a thing. I don't know where I was at that stage: Focus 23/24 maybe.
<br>
<br>
When perceiving these kinds of events, at an early stage in the Phasing process, I found it far more productive to ignore the natural inclination to get curious and start trying to investigate. Instead, regardless of what happens, I avoid commenting or reacting to any of it and simply let events take their natural course.
<br>
<br>
It's ever so easy to get bogged down *especially* in the early stages of the Physical to Astral transition, as all manner of distractions can interrupt your thinking. Unfortunately, the lower Astral contains every kind of weirdo who ever lived. As a beginner, it is
<u>
 ever so easy
</u>
to have your focus of attention thwarted by some lower-level circumstance.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, once you get entangled in some negative-style event, it becomes next to impossible to revert to your original track. All the exciting stuff goes on within the upper Astral which is were I'd advise people to concentrate on heading.

The thought occurs to me you might need to watch you don't start engaging in an act of creative visualisation, as I talk about on both this thread and others. Because this can work against you.

<br>
I'm sorry, but I don't engage in any kind of formal meditation or trance work. I have read posts from people in the past who do, who have mentioned about tingling sensations, and so forth.
<br>
<br>
With me, I basically do the same as detailed in my Q &amp; A post yesterday, for example. I use the Wave-1 CD with a mental rundown as a kind of primer. During which time I get no particular bodily sensations. Then I Phase for real by ceasing any internal dialogue and avoid reacting to anything I may perceive. Often I might have to use a shortform version of my rundown, just to kick-start the process.
<br>
<br>
After a while, there is this mental knowing feeling which indicates I made the switch from external to internal at Focus 10. Then I start to perceive all kinds of abstract imagery.

  Oh, and another question: when going through the F10 exercise, and visualizing myself going through it, I have something like a running commentary but as if from my visualized self's side.

<br>
<br>
In my experience, when you come to try for-real, any internal commentary tends to put a spoke in the works. What I think you should perhaps do from the outset, then, is try and think in visual terms only.

Thanks Frank, your post has been very informative - as always - especially the bit about silencing my inner running commentary. Note well taken [

<br>
<br>
Ah, and I even have an update on my progress! [^]
<br>
Last night was just the 2nd time I listened to the Wave I CD (which has a couple of really annoying blips and clicks at some point - results of scratches I assume - which really distract me, but I'll repair it hopefully today), and I also must note that I never did any meditation before; what I meant in my previous post is that I tried kinda meditating while utilizing RB's NEW system for a really short while, but I didn't really like it and stopped.
<br>
Anyway, while listening to the first track (not the F10 one, but the intro one which talks only about F3), I was visualizing (imagining would be a more proper term, as it's not just visuals) myself going through a shortened version of my startup sequence, and still having inner running commentary. At some point, I kinda tried to silence that inner voice as I had a feeling I'll have better progress if it shuts up. I have no idea what I thought about next (explanation soon), but then I forgot about my body (obviously I didn't consciously know that at the time) and saw a small, blurry and unfocused image in the center of my field of view (I have no idea if the blackness around it was 3D or not, didn't pay any attention to it). At that moment I managed to keep passively and quietly observing what I saw. But then, it suddenly grew and filled my entire field of view, it also got completely focused. What I saw was an open book, for some reason I
<i>
 knew
</i>
that it was Astral Dynamics, lying on a carpet which looked just like mine, lighted exactly by the warm-yellow lighting I usually have in my room. But on the upper edge of that book was a black spidery creature, and it was OK for me while it just stood still. Then it started running towards the rightmost edge of the book, and as it did that it transformed into a disgusting scary insect-like thingy. *Shudders*. That really got me startled, disgusted and alarmed, and of course I was zapped back to C1 right after hearing my inner voice shouting "what the f***!?". I was expecting to start seeing images of a sort, but I didn't expect them to be so yucky! The whole thing was just about 2.5 seconds long I guess. After I cooled off for a few seconds, I try to recall what was I thinking about/imagining right before I got to saw that, and no matter how hard I tried to recall it, I didn't have an idea! After I gave up trying to recall what was I doing, I did try to get going again, but of course, as startled, excited and grossed out as I was I didn't achieve anything. By the time I got to the 2nd track I couldn't stop yawning and suffering from neck tension so I just went to sleep. Heh.
<br>
LOL, it was quite hard to resist the urge to get up from bed before I go to sleep and check my AD book and see if it's clean [:I]
<br>
Now, First of all I am happy overall about the experience, as now I know that I am making real progress (so it seems
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
, and even though yesterday I thought that image is going to traumatize me and now I'll have eternal problems trying to phase, but today I think I (almost) got over it completely.
<br>
If that spidery thing was something from a low astral level, it's weird how it seemed to be in an environment so familiar to me (the book which
<i>
 felt
</i>
like mine, the carpet, the lighting..)
<br>
<br>
BTW, I didn't imagine that image/animation, it was vivid and real and engrossing that it was
<i>
 exactly
</i>
like real sight, but as if I could zoom in really really close to things, and also view them from not-exactly-possible angles.
<br>

P.S
<br>
Yay, just noticed that I can simply copy this post to my Astral Progress Journal (which, even though I'm definetly not an expert and I myself have one only for 2 days, I recommend everyone to write) instead of rewriting about my experience [

Noxerus: That sounds like a typical lower-level Focus experience.
<br>
<br>
As I say, all manner of distractions can interrupt your thinking. Now you have experienced first-hand how, once you get entangled in some negative-style event, it becomes next to impossible to revert to your original track.
<br>
<br>
In a similar vein, the last major false-awakening experience I had was last year. I came back to Physical (or so I thought) and was laying in my bed, in my bedroom. Yet, what I was perceiving, was entirely an Astral construct. The search-link is here

</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm pleased you're happy overall about your experience. I really wouldn't worry as, chances are, you'll get zapped to C1 a good many times yet. Not that I am wishing it upon you, you understand. It's just that I always try to be realistic. From what you say the thought occurs to me you could have a bit of a knack for this kind of thing.

<section>
Frank, I hope you are still watching and interested in this thread.  I have been studying it and working with the incredibly helpful ideas and thoughts you have posted.  Thank you so much.
<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the thread you said you wanted to learn about where Monroe was coming from with regards to phasing into the astral.  What have you learned in this regard?  What is your current working definition of 'phasing'?  At what specific points in your process do you phase, and exactly what is it you do?
<br>
<br>
Also, farther up this page of the thread, on April 29th, you referred to a post you made on the previous day regarding " I basically do the same as detailed in my Q &amp; A post yesterday".  I have searched for this post/thread and haven't found it.  Can you suggest a search strategy?
<br>
<br>
This next question may be impossible for you to comment on, but I was making perceivable and repeatable progress until the last month or more.  For the last 4 - 6 weeks it appears as though nothing is happening at all - no progress.  Heck, I can't even get as far as I was getting before (partial exits from the physical).  Have you had any flat periods?  If so, what did you do?
<br>
<br>
I would be most grateful for any comments.

<br>
Frank is away from the forums for now as he is busy moving house, however, I believe I can help with the last part of your question.
<br>
<br>
For some reason we all go through periods of progression followed by peiods where nothing happens at all. Sometimes these flat periods can go on for some time. I know Frank has commented in the past that while he used to get annoyed at these periods, now he just accepts them and waits them out. Sooner or later, your progress will resume, as long as you still have the intent to do so of course. Forcing it won't help, instead just try not to worry about it.
<br>
<br>
Even while you ARE making progress you can stil get stumped. While Frank says that at times he can phase after about half an hour of focused attention, at other times he will still lying there after several hours! (long after I would have given up, to be honest!).
<br>
<br>
So don't worry, just keep doing you exercises and wait for progress to resume. You can even take a break for a while, I have done this in the past and found it to help.
<br>
I have had flat periods in the past of several months so six weeks isnt that bad!
<br>
<br>

<br>
Douglas

<section>
Thank you Douglas - your thoughts make sense to me.  Today I went back to my original approach, following Monroe's approach as I understand it (hence, my intense interest in Frank's posts).  After 2 hours of staying in F10 (trance state) I entered the vibrational state by squeezing my etheric body - a technique I thought of myself (if others use this method, I'm not aware of it).  It was brief, a few seconds, but I am happy to have something happen.  I have an intense, chronic, health condition, and one of the many things I've learned in 5.5 years of physical suffering is patience.  So, during my flat period I remained engaged and happy.  But I asked the question to find out what other(s) do during flat periods.  My understanding from your post is to just keep practicing.  I hope Frank's move goes well, and still hope he finds this thread upon his return.

This looks like a good site. The author seems to be another graduate of the Monroe school!

I like reading the accounts of Monroe's succesors, like Bruce Moen for example and their own unique slants on phasing and the like.

I hope people still pay attention to this topic. I am new to AP and such and I have gotten alot of guidence from the forums here. My thanks to all you who posted in this 11 page behemoth.
<br>
I have been trying some diff techniques and making my own for about 2 weeks now and last night I started by laying in bed and listening to the fan in my room while also trying some body asleep mind awake techniques but then i started to try and focus more on the darkness and I started to feel the vibrations I have read so much about here. Also it felt like I was leaving my body, but not really going up, but more inside or down into it... if that makes sense.
<br>
Anyways I got excited and came back to "c1"
<br>
I was wondering if someone can give me some advice on being able to stay at the point I was at..

Originally I have posted this article at mysticweb forum . People there are not very keen on BW .
<br>
During my search of astral travel I have tried a lot including Monroe's institute Getaway series (whole set and lot of money).
<br>
Whole series consists of Hemisync wave signal and spoken guidance, as you probably already know. Example you have from 5 to 10 minutes of sound waves and then you hear " Now you feel relaxed ..." and I would get mad "well I was relaxed until you have stared talk". For this reason  I never could use it completely .I have " I do not like to listen authority syndrome". Anyhow after extended period of time I was able to achieve  very weak state of altered conscience during my dreaming,  but never totally lucid dream. On other hand it helped amazingly with dream recollection. My memory and logic understanding has improved (even though I do not know if it was intention of that particular series). Right know I am using Brain wave generator which can be purchased from internet addition to it you can download different presets for sound waves. I feel that BWG presets are not yet  at same level of quality as Hemisync and I do not mean quality of sound but quality how they work.
<br>
There are three reason why I am using BW . First it helps eliminate outside sounds. Second it help oversound  tinnitus I have in my left ear which in my case is  high pitch tone. Interestingly it always happen only when I try to meditate and relax. Third one it will  get me into altered state almost immediately. Mind you that I have achieve only four  out of body experience and it was because I used waking up in dream technique. Therefore BW are not magic bullets.
<br>
A few extras. I never use it when I have headache ,because it amplify and extend the pain .I do not use it when I feel that I am on the verge of getting headache ,because it can override pills which usually help me .
<br>
Observation. My guess is that Monroe's institute is layering a few different frequencies plus let say after 5 minutes of theta waves they change frequencies to alpha or beta states  maybe for 30 sec to awaken you and prevent to fall asleep and then again go back to theta.
<br>
One extra experience. As I have prepared wave CD from wave generator program
<br>
my computer started screen saver "aquarium" and what I have gotten was 15 minutes of theta wave spiked with the sound of the "aquarium" screen saver, unaware of this fact I used it. What happened is that in the moment when the sound of aquarium started suddenly I was in front of my PC, but because it continued I realized my mistake I returned to my body and woke up.

Hey Thanks MajorTom, I've been doing wave 1 aswell, and your post has helped confirm alot for me. From my experience, I pretty much agree with all that you've written and its nice to hear that others have had similar experiences with focus 10.
<br>
I'm just starting wave 2 now, I'm sooo excited! Have you done much in focus 12 yet? I'd like to hear about it.
<br>
Maybe we should start a new thread for Gateway Wave 2 pointers.[

Hi MajorTom,
<br>
<br>
Great to see you on the forum again (for ever how long you can afford)! No doubt everyone, myself included is really valuing your recent contribution and astute observations. Good on you!
<br>
<br>
Kind wishes,

   Glad to hear you have similar experiences. What are your experiences with the reball? Similar to as what describe where "body" bounderies are located further away rom the body?

My REBALL is egg shaped and golden in colour, I had difficulty in the initial exercise imagining the fountain of energy pouring from my head to feet, I find it a lot easier to just expand it from my middle outwards. Until recently I've only really been thinking of it as a protective forcefield, and I tend to forget about it once I've "activated" it, unless I feel defensive in which case I'll  re-pop it... But in my last excercise I played with it a little while in F10. I expanded it beyond my room and then beyond my house, thefurther I went the harder I had to focus, and when I stopped focusing it seemed to snap back to its origonal egg shape just around my body. I sense that with more practice I will find it easier to hold a larger perception. Whatever size my reball is, I am still aware of my physical "position", but I've only just started playing around with this tool so pehaps that'll change in time.

   I got an idea of what to expect, bbut I try to move ahead very slowly. Sofar I've been able to hold a focus 10 state with two dogs barking in my bed [8D]. That's actually aother thing that differentiates fcus 10 from a hypnagogic state or lower focus levels. If you startle or snap out of the experience very quickly, you probably weren't in focus 10. Similar to your experiences?

Yep, my flat can be really noisey at times, so I definitely share your experiences here.  I find that in focus 10, I am not only relaxed physically, but am also emotionally calm. Kinda like when you've just woken from a really peaceful dream and your still in that serene relaxed state of mind. So any disturbances I easily brush off or make use of (one time I had a fly buzzing around me like a jumbo jet and I made use of the sound and shifted my perception to flying around my room). I waver in and out of awareness quite a bit in focus 10, I figure this is caused by that anoying lifelong habit I have of going to sleep![
<img alt=":)" class="smiley" src="https://www.astralpulse.com/forums/Smileys/fugue/smiley.png" title="Smiley"/>
] I have also had the experience of feeling like I'm still awake and thinking that I haven't been successful, only to find that infact I've been in F10 all along.
<br>
I tried a focus 12 exercise the other night and my flatmates came home just as I got to focus 10 and started singing horendously in the lounge, I decided that it was too disturbing to get to focus 12 and so I tried to wake up.. I found that I was deeper than I thought and I had to count my self back to C1, to find the energy to fulfill my intent.

   <br>
   Technically speaking, focus 12 will represent another phase shift further away from the physical, and a greater reduction of phisical stimuli to the extent that one becomes more fully "alligned" with one's non-physical energy or second body. Some contact with space/time (i.e. one's immediate environment) is still possible there with regards to an awareness of one's spatial position in the RTZ if one focuses on it.

Well, I've had my first experience with Focus12 and, as expected, it was much more intense than focus10.  The first exercise in Wave 2 is intro to focus12 and it takes you back and forwarth between F10 and F12. The main difference for me is that my body became well and truly asleep in F12, while it was really just numb in F10.  This allowed me to expand my awareness beyond my body focus perception. Very cool! So I had an experience inside a visualisation, where my main intent was to meet others for guidance or just energy experience. I received guidance and also encountered an entity who seemed somewhat confused and directionless. I didn't really find out much more before the exercise finished and I was back to C1, but it was very encouraging.

Wow, MajorTom, you're at the same tape as me, thats fantastic![

I'm gonna spend some more time playing with my reball (that was the message I recieved in focus 12), but to answer your question; When I expanded my reball I sort of used both techniques, first I imagined the expanded area, then I pushed my energy into it so that I actually felt the expansion within myself. What sort of experiences have you had with yours?
<br>
<br>
I've always been a bit of a daydreamer, so I tend towards visualisation anyway, but with the enhanced wave and seagull noises on this tape I couldn't help but see myself on a beach at sunset[^][^] I found Franks origonal post on this thread particularly helpful, though I don't think I've quite got to the shift from imagination to lived in experience yet. I agree with you that it has alot to do with confidence and intention.  When like attracts like, the ability to face your own fears is invaluable.
<br>
<br>
Something that I've noticed is that while in focus 10 I waver between awareness and dreamstate, but once beyond and into focus 12, I find myself much more able to hold concious awareness. Have you noticed this?

I've done a few more excercises, and I've been playing with my Reball alot. I just thought I'd list a few of the things I've tried with it.
<br>
<br>
During one exercise I wasn't having much luck with getting my body to go to sleep in Focus 10, I started feeling my body temperature drop and I got the chills, I imagined my reball as a ball of sunshine engulfing my body and found it helped emensely.
<br>
<br>
Near the end of the same exercise I was experiencing a fair bit of pain in my shoulder, I think I was lying funny on it, so I shrunk my reball down to about the size of a basketball and moved it over my shoulder. I felt an almost instant relief which lasted until I finished the hemi-sync and was able to sit up.
<br>
<br>
I have tried to move my reball away from me, but sofar I haven't had much luck. Expanding it has worked though, and I've been trying to expand it and then relocate my perspective within it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the tools given to you through out the Gateway tapes have a whole lot more potential that what is initially appearant.

One thing I'd like to add to this great thread from my personal experience: relaxation is wonderful. My mind is very overactive. When I lay down to practice, I'll have three conversations and a song repeating over and over in my mind, and not be able to focus on one thing longer than a couple seconds. But I don't worry about this at all. I just relax, deeper and deeper.
<br>
<br>
When I get to a deeper point of relaxation, it becomes very easy to clear my mind and focus. The only thing that disturbs this is excitement or impatience, but these can be worked through. When I'm more deeply relaxed, my imagination is also far more clear and potent. Things like this happen naturally the more relaxed you are.
<br>
<br>
Relax!
